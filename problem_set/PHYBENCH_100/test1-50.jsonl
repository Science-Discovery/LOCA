The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity.

This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation.

We can choose the $\\pmb{x}$ axis along the direction of $\\pmb{E}$, so $\\pmb{E}_{y}=0$, and the velocity components related to transverse components can be treated separately. The equation of motion is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d v}{d t}}=q({\\pmb{E}}+v\\times{\\pmb{B}})\n$$  \n\nIts $\\pmb{z}$ component is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{z}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{z}\n$$  \n\nIntegrating yields  \n\n$$\nv_{\\tau}=\\frac{q E_{z}}{m}t+v_{z0}\n$$  \n\nThis is a simple motion along the direction of $\\pmb{B}$.

Thus, the two equations can be replaced by  \n\n$$\nv_{x}=v_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{\\mathrm{e}}t+\\delta)}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\upsilon_{y}=-i\\upsilon_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the angle between the component of the particle's initial velocity in the $_{xy}$ plane ${\\pmb v}_{\\bot}$ and the $\\pmb{x}$ axis (counter-clockwise direction).

Since we already know that the term $\\textstyle m{\\frac{d v}{d t}}$ only gives rise to circular motion with frequency $\\omega_{c}$, this term can be ignored in equation (1). Thus, equation (1) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{{ E}}+\\pmb{{\\upsilon}}\\times\\pmb{{ B}}=0\n$$  \n\nBy taking the cross product of $\\pmb{B}$ with the above expression, we get  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{E}\\times\\pmb{B}=\\pmb{B}\\times(\\pmb{v}\\times\\pmb{B})=\\pmb{v}\\pmb{B}^{2}-\\pmb{B}(\\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{B})\n$$  \n\nThe transverse component of this equation is  \n\n$$\nv_{\\perp q c}=E\\times B/B^{2}\\equiv v_{E}\n$$  \n\nWe define this transverse component as $\\pmb{v}_{E}$, which is the electric field drift towards the center of guidance.\n\nThe equation of motion for the particle is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d{\\boldsymbol{v}}}{d t}}=q[{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{y}})+{\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times{\\boldsymbol{B}}]\n$$  \n\nDecomposing into scalar form, we have  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{x}=\\frac{q B}{m}v_{y}+\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}(y)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{y}=-\\frac{q B}{m}v_{x}\n$$  \n\nSimplifying yields  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{\\upsilon}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\upsilon_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\frac{\\dot{E}_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\pmb{E_{x}}(\\pmb{y})$ is the electric field at the particle's location. To compute this value, we need to know the particle's trajectory, which is precisely what we attempt to solve initially. If the electric field is weak, as a first approximation, we can estimate $E_{x}(y)$ using the undisturbed trajectory.\n\nThe trajectory in the absence of an electric field is given by  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{r_{L}=\\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{|q|B}}\\end{array}$ is the Larmor gyration radius, and we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)\n$$  \n\nWe seek a solution that is the sum of the gyration at $\\omega_{c}$ and a stationary drift $_{v_{E}}$. Since we are interested in expressing $v_{E}$, we can average over one cycle to eliminate the gyration motion. Thus, the equation yields  \n\n$$\n\\bar{v}_{x}=0\n$$  \n\nIn the above equation, the average of the oscillating term $\\ddot{v}_{y}$ is clearly zero, giving us  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\ddot{v}}}_{y}=0=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\overline{{v}}_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\overline{{\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)}}\n$$  \n\nUpon expanding the small approximation and averaging, we find  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{v}}_{y}=-\\frac{E_{x}(y_{0})}{B}(1-\\frac{1}{4}k^{2}r_{L}^{2})\n$$  \n\nThus, due to non-uniformity, the usual $\\pmb{{E}}\\times\\pmb{{B}}$ drift is modified to  \n\n$$\n\\boxed{v_{E}={\\frac{E\\times B}{B^{2}}}(1-{\\frac{1}{4}}{(k \\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{\\vert{q}\\vert B})}^2)}\n$$  \n\nThe correction term represents the finite Larmor radius effect under the sinusoidal electric field distribution.", "final_answers": "$$\nv_E = \\frac{E \\times B}{B^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left(k \\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q| B}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$"}
