On its surface at the equator, there are 3 mutually orthogonal wires with negligible mass and thickness and a unit length resistance of \\( \\lambda \\). These wires are connected at the intersection point. The sphere is placed on the ground so that the circular surface formed by one of the wires is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. It is known that the sphere's center has acquired a velocity \\( v_0 \\) in the horizontal plane, and its initial angular velocity is such that it is in a pure rolling state. What is the subsequent change in velocity?", "solutions": "By noticing that the cutting of the magnetic field by the wire induces an electromotive force, which in turn generates Ampere force and torque, the motion state of the sphere changes. Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical. This results in no current through the cross-shaped wires in the center.   \n\nOnly the circular arcs perpendicular to the ${\\pmb x}$ direction have current, with the electromotive force given by:\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-\\pi R^{2}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nThus, the current is:\n\n$$\nI={\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2\\pi R\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nThe $\\pmb{\\mathscr{x}}$ component of the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{x}=I S=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{\\vec{B}}\n$$  \n\nIn the rest frame, the magnetic field rotates at an angular velocity of $-\\alpha$ (referring to the angular velocity of the sphere's rotation).
