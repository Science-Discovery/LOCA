The setup involves a light source, a primary slit $S_0$, a double slit ($S_1$ and $S_2$), and a receiving screen. The modification consists of placing three polarizers in the light path: $P_0$ at slit $S_0$, $P_1$ at slit $S_1$, and $P_2$ at slit $S_2$.\n\nThe light from a point source is first passed through slit $S_0$ to create a spatially coherent line source. This light is then linearly polarized by $P_0$. The polarized light illuminates the double slits $S_1$ and $S_2$. The light passing through each of these slits is then polarized again by $P_1$ and $P_2$, respectively. Finally, the two beams of light interfere on the receiving screen, creating a fringe pattern.\n\nThe orientations of the polarizers are given as:\n1.  The transmission axis of $P_1$ is parallel to the transmission axis of $P_0$.\n2.  The transmission axis of $P_2$ makes an angle of $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ with the transmission axis of $P_0$.\n\nThe objective is to determine the contrast of the interference fringes, denoted by $\\gamma$.\n\nWe define the following variables and assumptions:\n-   The initial light from the source is unpolarized. The polarizers are ideal.\n-   The light emerging from the first polarizer $P_0$ is linearly polarized. Let its electric field amplitude be $A$.\n-   We establish a 2D Cartesian coordinate system where the x-axis is aligned with the transmission axis of polarizer $P_0$.\n-   $\\vec{E}_1$ and $\\vec{E}_2$ are the electric field amplitude vectors of the light immediately after passing through the slit-polarizer combinations ($S_1, P_1$) and ($S_2, P_2$), respectively.\n-   The light from $P_0$ illuminates $S_1$ and $S_2$ coherently and with the same amplitude $A$.\n-   $\\delta$ is the phase difference between the waves from $S_1$ and $S_2$ arriving at a point on the screen, which arises from the path length difference.\n-   $I(\\delta)$ is the total light intensity at that point on the screen as a function of $\\delta$.\n-   $I_{max}$ and $I_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum intensities in the fringe pattern.\n-   $\\gamma$ is the fringe contrast, which we need to calculate.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Electric Field Vectors after the Slits\nWe apply Malus's Law to find the amplitude and direction of the electric fields emerging from polarizers $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n\n#### Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions\nThe amplitude of a linearly polarized light wave after passing through a polarizer is given by the amplitude version of Malus's Law:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A_{\\text{transmitted}} = A_{\\text{incident}} \\cos\\alpha}\n\\]\nwhere $A_{\\text{incident}}$ is the amplitude of the incident linearly polarized light, and $\\alpha$ is the angle between the incident polarization direction and the transmission axis of the polarizer.\n\n#### Derivation\nThe light incident on both $P_1$ and $P_2$ has passed through $P_0$, so it is linearly polarized along the x-axis with amplitude $A$.\n\n1.  **Field from Slit $S_1$**: The polarizer $P_1$ has its transmission axis parallel to that of $P_0$ (the x-axis). Therefore, the angle $\\alpha_1$ between the incident polarization and the axis of $P_1$ is $0^\\circ$. The amplitude of the transmitted field, $A_1$, is:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    A_1 = A \\cos(0^\\circ) = A\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n    The polarization direction remains along the x-axis. Thus, the electric field amplitude vector $\\vec{E}_1$ is:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\vec{E}_1 = A\\hat{i}\n    \\label{eq:E1} \\tag{1}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Field from Slit $S_2$**: The polarizer $P_2$ has its transmission axis at an angle $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ to that of $P_0$ (the x-axis). The angle $\\alpha_2$ is $60^\\circ$. The amplitude of the transmitted field, $A_2$, is:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    A_2 = A \\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}A\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n    The polarization direction of this wave is at $60^\\circ$ to the x-axis. The vector $\\vec{E}_2$ is given by its amplitude $A_2$ multiplied by the unit vector in its polarization direction, $\\hat{u}_2 = \\cos(60^\\circ)\\hat{i} + \\sin(60^\\circ)\\hat{j}$.\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\vec{E}_2 &= A_2 (\\cos 60^\\circ \\hat{i} + \\sin 60^\\circ \\hat{j}) \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{2}A \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\hat{j}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{4}A\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}A\\hat{j}\n    \\label{eq:E2} \\tag{2}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Total Intensity on the Screen\nThe total intensity on the screen results from the superposition of the electric fields from both slits. Since the fields are not polarized in the same direction, we must treat their superposition as a vector sum. A convenient method is to decompose the fields into orthogonal components and sum their intensities, as orthogonal polarizations do not interfere.\n\n#### Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions\nThe total electric field at any point is the vector sum of the individual fields (Principle of Superposition).\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{E}_{\\text{total}} = \\vec{E}_{1,\\text{screen}} + \\vec{E}_{2,\\text{screen}}}\n\\]\nThe intensity of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to the time-average of the square of the magnitude of the electric field.\n\\[\n\\boxed{I \\propto \\langle |\\vec{E}_{\\text{total}}|^2 \\rangle_t}\n\\]\nFor orthogonal vector components, the dot product is zero.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\hat{i} \\cdot \\hat{j} = 0}\n\\]\n\n#### Derivation\nThe total electric field at a point on the screen is the superposition of the fields from slit 1 and slit 2, including the phase difference $\\delta$. We can decompose the total field into its orthogonal x and y components: $\\vec{E}_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{total},x}\\hat{i} + E_{\\text{total},y}\\hat{j}$. The total intensity is then:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_{\\text{total}} &\\propto \\langle |\\vec{E}_{\\text{total}}|^2 \\rangle_t = \\langle (E_{\\text{total},x}\\hat{i} + E_{\\text{total},y}\\hat{j}) \\cdot (E_{\\text{total},x}\\hat{i} + E_{\\text{total},y}\\hat{j}) \\rangle_t \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\langle E_{\\text{total},x}^2 (\\hat{i} \\cdot \\hat{i}) + E_{\\text{total},y}^2 (\\hat{j} \\cdot \\hat{j}) + 2 E_{\\text{total},x} E_{\\text{total},y} (\\hat{i} \\cdot \\hat{j}) \\rangle_t \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\langle E_{\\text{total},x}^2 + E_{\\text{total},y}^2 \\rangle_t \\quad (\\text{since } \\hat{i} \\cdot \\hat{i} = 1, \\hat{j} \\cdot \\hat{j} = 1, \\hat{i} \\cdot \\hat{j} = 0) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\langle E_{\\text{total},x}^2 \\rangle_t + \\langle E_{\\text{total},y}^2 \\rangle_t\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis shows that the total intensity is the sum of the intensities of the orthogonal components. The x-components from both slits are parallel and coherent, so they will interfere. The y-component of the field comes only from slit 2, so it does not interfere but adds a constant background intensity.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_{\\text{total}} = I_x + I_y\n\\label{eq:I_sum} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Derive the Intensity Distribution Function\nWe now derive the mathematical expression for the total intensity $I$ as a function of the phase difference $\\delta$.\n\n#### Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions\nFor two coherent, parallel-polarized waves with intensities $I_a$ and $I_b$ and a phase difference $\\delta$, the intensity of their superposition is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{I_{\\text{interfere}} = I_a + I_b + 2\\sqrt{I_a I_b} \\cos\\delta}\n\\]\nThe intensity of a single wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude:\n\\[\n\\boxed{I \\propto A^2}\n\\]\n\n#### Derivation\nLet $k_0$ be the proportionality constant relating squared amplitude to intensity, so that $I = k_0 A_{\\text{amp}}^2$. The field amplitude components from Step 1 are: $E_{1x, \\text{amp}} = A$, $E_{1y, \\text{amp}} = 0$, $E_{2x, \\text{amp}} = \\frac{1}{4}A$, and $E_{2y, \\text{amp}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}A$.\n\n1.  **Intensity of x-components ($I_x$)**: The interfering x-components have amplitudes $E_{1x, \\text{amp}} = A$ and $E_{2x, \\text{amp}} = \\frac{1}{4}A$. Their corresponding intensities are $I_{1x} = k_0 A^2$ and $I_{2x} = k_0 (\\frac{1}{4}A)^2 = \\frac{k_0}{16}A^2$. Applying the interference formula:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    I_x &= I_{1x} + I_{2x} + 2\\sqrt{I_{1x} I_{2x}} \\cos\\delta \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= k_0 A^2 + \\frac{k_0}{16}A^2 + 2\\sqrt{(k_0 A^2)\\left(\\frac{k_0}{16}A^2\\right)}\\cos\\delta \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= k_0 A^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{16}\\right) + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k_0^2 A^4}{16}}\\cos\\delta \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= k_0 A^2 \\frac{17}{16} + 2\\left(\\frac{k_0 A^2}{4}\\right)\\cos\\delta \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= k_0 A^2 \\left( \\frac{17}{16} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\delta \\right)\n    \\label{eq:Ix_calc} \\tag{4}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Intensity of y-component ($I_y$)**: This component comes only from slit 2 with amplitude $E_{2y, \\text{amp}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}A$.\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    I_y = k_0 (E_{2y, \\text{amp}})^2 = k_0 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}A\\right)^2 = k_0 \\frac{3}{16}A^2\n    \\label{eq:Iy_calc} \\tag{5}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n3.  **Total Intensity ($I$)**: Using Eq. \\eqref{eq:I_sum}, we sum $I_x$ and $I_y$:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    I(\\delta) &= I_x + I_y = k_0 A^2 \\left( \\frac{17}{16} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\delta \\right) + k_0 \\frac{3}{16}A^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= k_0 A^2 \\left( \\frac{17}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\delta \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= k_0 A^2 \\left( \\frac{20}{16} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\delta \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= k_0 A^2 \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\delta \\right)\n    \\label{eq:Itot_calc} \\tag{6}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Fringe Contrast\nUsing the derived intensity distribution, we can now calculate the fringe contrast $\\gamma$.\n\n#### Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions\nThe fringe contrast (or visibility), $\\gamma$, is defined by the relation:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\gamma = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}}\n\\]\n\n#### Derivation\nThe intensity function is $I(\\delta) = C \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\delta \\right)$, where $C = k_0 A^2$ is a constant.\nThe maximum intensity $I_{max}$ occurs when the constructive interference is maximal, i.e., when $\\cos\\delta = 1$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_{max} = C \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}(1) \\right) = C \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{7}{4}C\n\\label{eq:Imax} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe minimum intensity $I_{min}$ occurs when the destructive interference is maximal, i.e., when $\\cos\\delta = -1$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_{min} = C \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}(-1) \\right) = C \\left( \\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{3}{4}C\n\\label{eq:Imin} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we substitute these values into the formula for contrast $\\gamma$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\gamma &= \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{4}C - \\frac{3}{4}C}{\\frac{7}{4}C + \\frac{3}{4}C} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\frac{4}{4}C}{\\frac{10}{4}C} = \\frac{C}{\\frac{5}{2}C} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{5/2} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\label{eq:gamma_calc} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe contrast of the stripes on the receiving screen is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\gamma = \\frac{2}{5}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The force from the disk is the only external force acting on the bug, and thus it is the net force.\n*   We will use two coordinate systems:\n    1.  An inertial (non-rotating) frame of reference, $S$, with its origin at the center of the disk, $O$.\n    2.  A rotating frame of reference, $S'$, which is fixed to the disk. Its origin is also at $O$, and it rotates with angular velocity $\\vec{\\omega}$ relative to $S$.\n*   We align the z-axis with the axis of rotation, so $\\vec{\\omega} = \\omega \\hat{k}$. The disk lies in the $xy$-plane of both frames. The unit vectors in the rotating frame are denoted by $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$.\n*   **Interpretation:** The statement \"bug's angular crawling velocity relative to the disk is ... $\\omega$\" is interpreted to mean that the bug's angular velocity about the center of its own circular path (on the disk) is $\\omega$.\n\n**Variables:**\n*   $m$: Mass of the bug.\n*   $R$: Radius of the bug's circular path on the disk.\n*   $\\omega$: Magnitude of the angular velocity of both the disk and the bug's relative motion.\n*   $\\vec{r}'$: Position vector of the bug in the rotating frame $S'$.\n*   $\\vec{v}'$: Velocity of the bug relative to the rotating frame $S'$.\n*   $\\vec{a}'$: Acceleration of the bug relative to the rotating frame $S'$.\n*   $\\vec{a}$: Absolute acceleration of the bug in the inertial frame $S$.\n*   $\\vec{F}$: Force exerted by the disk on the bug.

The bug's path is a circle of radius $R$ passing through the origin $O$. We can place the center of this circular path, $C$, at coordinates $(R, 0)$ in the $S'$ frame without loss of generality. The bug's position vector $\\vec{r}'$ is the sum of the vector from the origin to $C$ ($\\vec{r}_{OC}$) and the vector from $C$ to the bug ($\\vec{r}_{C,bug}$).\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe position of the bug is found by vector addition.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{r}'(t) = \\vec{r}_{OC} + \\vec{r}_{C,bug}(t)}\\]\nThe bug moves on its circular path with a constant relative angular velocity $\\omega$.

The position vector relative to the center of the path $C$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{r}_{C,bug}(t) = R\\cos(\\phi(t))\\hat{i} + R\\sin(\\phi(t))\\hat{j}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nLet the unit vectors of the Cartesian coordinate system in the rotating frame $S'$ be $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$. The position of the center of the bug's path is $\\vec{r}_{OC} = R\\hat{i}$. The position of the bug relative to $C$ is given by its circular motion with angle $\\phi(t) = \\omega t$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{r}'(t) &= \\vec{r}_{OC} + \\vec{r}_{C,bug}(t) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= R\\hat{i} + \\left( R\\cos(\\omega t)\\hat{i} + R\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat{j} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= R(1 + \\cos(\\omega t))\\hat{i} + R\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat{j} \\label{eq:pos_rel} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Relative Velocity and Acceleration of the Bug\nNext, we calculate the bug's velocity $\\vec{v}'$ and acceleration $\\vec{a}'$ relative to the rotating disk by taking the first and second time derivatives of the position vector $\\vec{r}'$ with respect to time.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe definitions of relative velocity and acceleration are:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{v}' = \\frac{d\\vec{r}'}{dt}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{a}' = \\frac{d\\vec{v}'}{dt}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nApplying these definitions to the position vector from Step 1 (eq. \\ref{eq:pos_rel}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{v}'(t) &= \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ R(1 + \\cos(\\omega t))\\hat{i} + R\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat{j} \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -R\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat{i} + R\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)\\hat{j} \\label{eq:vel_rel} \\tag{2} \\\\\n\\vec{a}'(t) &= \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ -R\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat{i} + R\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)\\hat{j} \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -R\\omega^2\\cos(\\omega t)\\hat{i} - R\\omega^2\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat{j} \\label{eq:acc_rel} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNote that $\\vec{a}'$ is the centripetal acceleration of the bug directed towards the center $C$ of its relative circular path.\n\n### Step 3: Transformation to the Inertial Frame\nThe absolute acceleration $\\vec{a}$ in the inertial frame $S$ is found using the transformation formula for rotating frames. This formula accounts for the motion of the frame itself and the motion of the object within the frame.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe general formula for acceleration transformation between an inertial frame and a rotating frame is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{a} = \\vec{a}' + 2(\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}') + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}') + \\frac{d\\vec{\\omega}}{dt} \\times \\vec{r}'}\\]\nThe disk rotates at a constant angular velocity, so the angular acceleration is zero.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d\\vec{\\omega}}{dt} = 0}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe formula simplifies to $\\vec{a} = \\vec{a}' + \\vec{a}_{Coriolis} + \\vec{a}_{centripetal}$.

The force is described by a Yukawa potential. We are asked to determine the total angle the system rotates about its center of mass during one complete period of a small radial oscillation around a stable circular orbit.\n\nThe given information, variables, and assumptions are as follows:\n1.  **System:** A deuteron, composed of a proton (mass $M_p$) and a neutron (mass $M_n$). For simplicity, we assume their masses are approximately equal, i.e., $M_p \\approx M_n = M_{nucleon}$.\n2.  **Interaction Potential:** The strong force potential energy between the two nucleons is given by the Yukawa potential:\n    $U = -\\frac{A\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{2\\pi m c r}{h}}}{r}$.\n    Here, $A$ is a positive constant representing the strength of the interaction, $r$ is the distance between the nucleons, $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $m$ is the mass of the force-propagating particle, the $\\pi$ meson.\n3.  **Range of Force:** The characteristic range of the force, denoted by $\\lambda$, is defined as $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{2\\pi m c}$. Using this definition, the potential energy can be written in its more standard form: $U(r) = -A \\frac{e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r}$.\n4.  **Motion:** The two particles are described as being in a stable circular orbit with a constant separation distance, which we take to be $r$. Superimposed on this circular motion are small radial oscillations about this equilibrium distance.\n5.  **Objective:** The goal is to calculate the total angle, $\\varphi$, that the system rotates about its center of mass during one full period of a small radial oscillation.\n\nThis two-body problem is best analyzed by transforming it into an equivalent one-body problem. This involves a single particle of reduced mass $\\mu$ moving in the central potential $U(r)$.\n*   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):** For a two-body system with masses $M_p$ and $M_n$, the reduced mass is $\\mu = \\frac{M_p M_n}{M_p + M_n}$. Given our assumption $M_p = M_n = M_{nucleon}$, the reduced mass is $\\mu = \\frac{M_{nucleon}^2}{2M_{nucleon}} = \\frac{M_{nucleon}}{2}$.\n*   **Key Variables:**\n    *   $L$: The conserved angular momentum of the system.\n    *   $\\omega$: The orbital angular velocity of the system in its stable circular path.\n    *   $\\omega_r$: The angular frequency of the small radial oscillations.\n\n### Step 1: Effective Potential for the Equivalent One-Body System\nFor a particle of reduced mass $\\mu$ with angular momentum $L$ moving in a central potential $U(r)$, the radial component of its motion can be described as a one-dimensional motion in an effective potential, $V_{eff}(r)$. This potential includes the original central potential and a centrifugal potential term.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\nV_{eff}(r) = U(r) + \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2}\n}\\]\nWe substitute the specific Yukawa potential $U(r) = -A \\frac{e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r}$ and the reduced mass $\\mu = M_{nucleon}/2$ into this general formula to obtain the effective potential for the deuteron system.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_{eff}(r) &= -\\frac{A e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r} + \\frac{L^2}{2(M_{nucleon}/2) r^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{A e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r} + \\frac{L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^2} \\label{eq:Veff} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Condition for a Stable Circular Orbit\nA stable circular orbit of radius $r$ corresponds to a local minimum of the effective potential $V_{eff}(r)$. This requires two conditions to be satisfied at the orbit radius: an equilibrium condition (the net radial force is zero) and a stability condition (the potential is at a minimum).\n\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\frac{dV_{eff}}{dr} = 0 \\quad (\\text{Equilibrium Condition})\n}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\frac{d^2V_{eff}}{dr^2} > 0 \\quad (\\text{Stability Condition})\n}\\]\nWe first apply the equilibrium condition to establish a relationship between the angular momentum $L$ and the radius $r$ of the circular orbit. We compute the first derivative of $V_{eff}(r)$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:Veff}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dV_{eff}}{dr} &= \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( -\\frac{A e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r} + \\frac{L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^2} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -A \\left( \\frac{e^{-r/\\lambda}(-1/\\lambda)}{r} - \\frac{e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^2} \\right) - \\frac{2L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^3} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= A e^{-r/\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{1}{r\\lambda} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right) - \\frac{2L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^3} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{A e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda} \\right) - \\frac{2L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^3} \\label{eq:dVeff_dr} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSetting this derivative to zero at the radius $r$ of the circular orbit gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{A e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda} \\right) - \\frac{2L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^3} &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{2L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^3} &= \\frac{A e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\nL^2 &= \\frac{M_{nucleon} A r e^{-r/\\lambda}}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda} \\right) \\label{eq:L2} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis equation provides the required squared angular momentum for a circular orbit of radius $r$. The stability condition will be checked in Step 4.\n\n### Step 3: Orbital Angular Velocity of the System\nThe orbital angular velocity, $\\omega$, describes the rate of rotation of the system. It is related to the angular momentum $L$, the reduced mass $\\mu$, and the orbital radius $r$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\nL = \\mu r^2 \\omega\n}\\]\nBy squaring this relation, we get $L^2 = (\\mu r^2 \\omega)^2$.

For small displacements from equilibrium, the system behaves like a simple harmonic oscillator.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\omega_r = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff}}{\\mu}}\n}\\]\nwhere the effective spring constant, $k_{eff}$, is given by the second derivative of the effective potential at the equilibrium radius $r$.\n\\[\\boxed{\nk_{eff} = \\frac{d^2V_{eff}}{dr^2}\\bigg|_{r}\n}\\]\nWe find $k_{eff}$ by first computing the general second derivative of $V_{eff}(r)$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:dVeff_dr}.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d^2V_{eff}}{dr^2} &= \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\frac{A e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda} \\right) - \\frac{2L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^3} \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= A \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^2} + \\frac{e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r\\lambda} \\right) + \\frac{6L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^4} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= A \\left[ \\left(\\frac{-2e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^3} - \\frac{e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^2\\lambda}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{-e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^2\\lambda} - \\frac{e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r\\lambda^2}\\right) \\right] + \\frac{6L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^4} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -A e^{-r/\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{2}{r^3} + \\frac{2}{r^2\\lambda} + \\frac{1}{r\\lambda^2} \\right) + \\frac{6L^2}{M_{nucleon} r^4} \\label{eq:d2Veff_dr2_general} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo evaluate this at the equilibrium radius, we substitute the expression for $L^2$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:L2} into Eq. \\eqref{eq:d2Veff_dr2_general}.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk_{eff} &= -A e^{-r/\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{2}{r^3} + \\frac{2}{r^2\\lambda} + \\frac{1}{r\\lambda^2} \\right) + \\frac{6}{M_{nucleon} r^4} \\left[ \\frac{M_{nucleon} A r e^{-r/\\lambda}}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda} \\right) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -A e^{-r/\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{2}{r^3} + \\frac{2}{r^2\\lambda} + \\frac{1}{r\\lambda^2} \\right) + \\frac{3 A e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^3} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= A e^{-r/\\lambda} \\left[ -\\frac{2}{r^3} - \\frac{2}{r^2\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{r\\lambda^2} + \\frac{3}{r^3} + \\frac{3}{r^2\\lambda} \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= A e^{-r/\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{1}{r^3} + \\frac{1}{r^2\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{r\\lambda^2} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{A e^{-r/\\lambda}}{r^3} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda} - \\frac{r^2}{\\lambda^2} \\right) \\label{eq:keff} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe stability condition $k_{eff} > 0$ requires $1 + r/\\lambda - r^2/\\lambda^2 > 0$, which ensures that $\\omega_r$ is a real frequency.

Let the tabletop be a horizontal plane. We consider the motion in a 2D vertical plane perpendicular to the edge of the table. Let the x-axis be horizontal and the y-axis be vertical. The tabletop corresponds to the region $y=0, x \\le 0$. The edge of the table is at the origin $(0,0)$. The gravitational acceleration is $\\vec{g} = -g\\hat{j}$.\n\nThe physical situation is described by a simplified model with the following key features and assumptions:\n\n1.  **Object and Environment**: The coin is treated as a uniform disk of mass $m$ and radius $r$. It moves on a smooth (frictionless) horizontal tabletop under a constant gravitational acceleration $g$.\n2.  **Planar Motion**: The impulse causes the coin to flip over. We model this as a planar motion in the vertical $xy$-plane. The coin rotates about an axis perpendicular to this plane, which corresponds to rotation about one of its diameters. The moment of inertia for this rotation is $J_{cm} = \\frac{1}{4}mr^2$.\n3.  **Simplified Kinematic Model**: The core simplifying assumption is that the coin's center of mass (CM) moves purely vertically, staying directly above the table's edge. This means the horizontal coordinate of the CM is fixed at $x_c = 0$ throughout the motion until lift-off.\n4.  **Kinematic Constraint**: Let $\\phi$ be the angle the coin's plane makes with the horizontal x-axis. Initially, the coin is flat, so $\\phi=0$. The CM is at position $\\vec{r}_c = (0, y_c)$. A point $P$ on the coin's circumference remains in contact with the table surface. The vector from the CM to this contact point $P$ is given by $\\vec{r}_{P/c} = (-r\\cos\\phi, -r\\sin\\phi)$. The absolute position of the contact point is $\\vec{r}_P = \\vec{r}_c + \\vec{r}_{P/c} = (0, y_c) + (-r\\cos\\phi, -r\\sin\\phi)$. Since the contact point lies on the table surface ($y=0$), its vertical coordinate must be zero. This gives the kinematic constraint: $y_c - r\\sin\\phi = 0 \\implies y_c = r\\sin\\phi$. The horizontal position of the contact point is $x_P = -r\\cos\\phi$. For contact to be on the table, we need $x_P \\le 0$, which requires $\\cos\\phi \\ge 0$. This condition holds for $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, which is the range of angles before the coin might become fully vertical.\n5.  **Lift-off Condition**: The coin leaves the table when the normal force $\\vec{N}$ exerted by the table on the coin becomes zero. Since the table surface is horizontal, the normal force is purely vertical, $\\vec{N} = N\\hat{j}$.\n\n**Variables**:\n*   $m$: mass of the coin.\n*   $r$: radius of the coin.\n*   $g$: acceleration due to gravity.\n*   $\\phi$: angle of the coin's plane with the horizontal.\n*   $y_c$: vertical coordinate of the center of mass (CM), with $y_c=r\\sin\\phi$.\n*   $\\omega = \\dot{\\phi}$: angular velocity of the coin.\n*   $v_c = \\dot{y}_c$: vertical velocity of the CM.\n*   $N$: magnitude of the normal force from the tabletop.\n*   $J_{cm}$: moment of inertia of the coin about a diameter, $J_{cm} = \\frac{1}{4}mr^2$.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum initial CM velocity, $v_{0, \\min}$, for the coin to lose contact with the table ($N=0$).\n\n### Step 1: Total Mechanical Energy of the System\nWe express the total mechanical energy of the coin. The energy is conserved because the only non-conservative force, the normal force, does no work.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe total kinetic energy of a rigid body in planar motion is the sum of the translational kinetic energy of the center of mass and the rotational kinetic energy about the center of mass.\n\\[\\boxed{E_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv_c^2 + \\frac{1}{2}J_{cm}\\omega^2}\\]\nThe gravitational potential energy of an object is determined by the height of its center of mass.\n\\[\\boxed{E_p = mgy_c}\\]\nThe principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical energy of a system is constant if the work done by all non-conservative forces is zero.\n\\[\\boxed{E = E_k + E_p = \\text{constant} \\quad \\text{if } W_{nc} = 0}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nFirst, we find the velocity of the center of mass by differentiating its position $y_c = r\\sin\\phi$ with respect to time:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_c = \\dot{y}_c = \\frac{d}{dt}(r\\sin\\phi) = r\\cos\\phi \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = r\\omega\\cos\\phi\n\\label{eq:vc}\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing this, the kinetic energy is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nE_k &= \\frac{1}{2}m(r\\omega\\cos\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}mr^2\\right)\\omega^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\omega^2\\cos^2\\phi + \\frac{1}{8}mr^2\\omega^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\omega^2 \\left(\\cos^2\\phi + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\n\\label{eq:Ek}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe potential energy is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nE_p = mgy_c = mgr\\sin\\phi\n\\label{eq:Ep}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe forces acting on the coin are gravity (conservative) and the normal force $\\vec{N}$. The normal force acts at the contact point $P$. The work done by the normal force is $W_N = \\int \\vec{N} \\cdot d\\vec{r}_P$. The power delivered by the normal force is $P_N = \\vec{N} \\cdot \\vec{v}_P$. The normal force is $\\vec{N}=(0, N)$. The velocity of the contact point is $\\vec{v}_P = \\frac{d\\vec{r}_P}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(-r\\cos\\phi, 0) = (r\\dot{\\phi}\\sin\\phi, 0)$. Since $\\vec{N} \\cdot \\vec{v}_P = (0, N) \\cdot (r\\dot{\\phi}\\sin\\phi, 0) = 0$, the normal force does no work. Thus, the total mechanical energy $E = E_k + E_p$ is conserved.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nE = \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 \\left(\\cos^2\\phi + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + mgr\\sin\\phi = E_0\n\\label{eq:Energy}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere $E_0$ is the initial energy of the system just after the impulse.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Conditions and Initial Energy\nWe relate the initial energy $E_0$ to the initial velocity of the center of mass $v_0$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe initial state at time $t=0$ (just after the impulse) is defined by the coin being horizontal, so $\\phi=0$. The initial velocity of the CM is $v_0$, and the initial angular velocity is $\\omega_0$.\n\n**Derivation**:\nAt $t=0$, we have $\\phi=0$. The kinematic relation from eq. \\eqref{eq:vc} must hold at $t=0$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_0 = v_c(t=0) = r\\omega_0\\cos(0) = r\\omega_0 \\implies \\omega_0 = \\frac{v_0}{r}\n\\label{eq:v0_omega0}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe initial potential energy is $E_p(0) = mgr\\sin(0) = 0$. The initial kinetic energy is found by substituting the initial conditions into the general expression for kinetic energy:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nE_0 &= E_k(t=0) + E_p(t=0) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + \\frac{1}{2}J_{cm}\\omega_0^2 + 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}mr^2\\right)\\left(\\frac{v_0}{r}\\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + \\frac{1}{8}mv_0^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{5}{8}mv_0^2\n\\label{eq:E0}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Condition for Leaving the Table\nWe establish the physical condition for lift-off using Newton's Second Law for the vertical motion of the CM.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nNewton's Second Law for the translational motion of the center of mass states that the net force equals mass times acceleration. For the vertical component:\n\\[\\boxed{\\sum F_y = ma_y}\\]\nThe coin leaves the table when contact is lost, which means the normal force becomes zero ($N=0$).\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe vertical acceleration of the CM is $a_y = \\ddot{y}_c$. We differentiate $v_c = \\dot{y}_c = r\\dot{\\phi}\\cos\\phi$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\na_y = \\ddot{y}_c = \\frac{d}{dt}(r\\dot{\\phi}\\cos\\phi) = r\\ddot{\\phi}\\cos\\phi - r\\dot{\\phi}^2\\sin\\phi\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe net vertical force is the sum of the upward normal force $N$ and the downward gravitational force $mg$. Applying Newton's Second Law:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum F_y = N - mg = ma_y = m(r\\ddot{\\phi}\\cos\\phi - r\\dot{\\phi}^2\\sin\\phi)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe coin leaves the table at the moment the normal force $N$ becomes zero. Let this occur at an angle $\\phi = \\theta$. The lift-off condition is $N=0$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n-mg &= m(r\\ddot{\\theta}\\cos\\theta - r\\dot{\\theta}^2\\sin\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n-\\frac{g}{r} &= \\ddot{\\theta}\\cos\\theta - \\dot{\\theta}^2\\sin\\theta\n\\label{eq:liftoff_condition}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 4: Dynamics and Lift-off Energy\nWe derive the equation of motion from energy conservation and combine it with the lift-off condition to find the energy required for lift-off at a given angle.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe equation of motion for a conservative system can be found by differentiating the energy conservation equation with respect to time.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nDifferentiating the energy conservation equation \\eqref{eq:Energy} with respect to time:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 \\left(\\cos^2\\phi + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + mgr\\sin\\phi \\right] = 0 \\nonumber \\\\\nmr^2\\dot{\\phi}\\ddot{\\phi} \\left(\\cos^2\\phi + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\dot{\\phi}^2(-2\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi\\dot{\\phi}) + mgr\\cos\\phi\\dot{\\phi} = 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nAssuming $\\dot{\\phi} \\neq 0$ (the coin is in motion), we can divide by $mr^2\\dot{\\phi}$ to get the equation of motion:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\ddot{\\phi} \\left(\\cos^2\\phi + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) - \\dot{\\phi}^2\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi + \\frac{g}{r}\\cos\\phi = 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nSolving for the angular acceleration $\\ddot{\\phi}$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\ddot{\\phi} = \\frac{\\dot{\\phi}^2\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi - \\frac{g}{r}\\cos\\phi}{\\cos^2\\phi + \\frac{1}{4}}\n\\label{eq:phi_ddot}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\ddot{\\theta}$ into the lift-off condition from eq. \\eqref{eq:liftoff_condition}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n-\\frac{g}{r} &= \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\dot{\\theta}^2\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\frac{g}{r}\\cos\\theta}{\\cos^2\\theta + \\frac{1}{4}} \\right) - \\dot{\\theta}^2\\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n-\\frac{g}{r}\\left(\\cos^2\\theta + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) &= \\dot{\\theta}^2\\cos^2\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\frac{g}{r}\\cos^2\\theta - \\dot{\\theta}^2\\sin\\theta\\left(\\cos^2\\theta + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n-\\frac{g}{r}\\cos^2\\theta - \\frac{g}{4r} &= \\dot{\\theta}^2\\cos^2\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\frac{g}{r}\\cos^2\\theta - \\dot{\\theta}^2\\cos^2\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{4}\\dot{\\theta}^2\\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n- \\frac{g}{4r} &= - \\frac{1}{4}\\dot{\\theta}^2\\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta}^2 &= \\frac{g}{r\\sin\\theta}\n\\label{eq:theta_dot_sq}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis equation gives the squared angular velocity at the moment of lift-off. We substitute this back into the energy conservation equation \\eqref{eq:Energy} to find the initial energy $E_0$ required to lift off at angle $\\theta$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nE_0 &= \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 \\left(\\cos^2\\theta + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + mgr\\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\left(\\frac{g}{r\\sin\\theta}\\right) \\left(1-\\sin^2\\theta + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + mgr\\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{mgr}{2\\sin\\theta}\\left(\\frac{5}{4}-\\sin^2\\theta\\right) + mgr\\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{mgr(5-4\\sin^2\\theta)}{8\\sin\\theta} + \\frac{8mgr\\sin^2\\theta}{8\\sin\\theta} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{mgr(5 + 4\\sin^2\\theta)}{8\\sin\\theta}\n\\label{eq:E0_theta}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 5: Minimizing the Initial Velocity\nTo find the minimum initial velocity, we must find the minimum initial energy $E_{0, \\min}$ that allows the lift-off condition to be met for some angle $\\theta$ in its valid range.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nTo find the minimum required initial energy, we must find the minimum value of the function $E_0(\\theta)$ derived in the previous step. The lift-off angle $\\theta$ must be in the range $(0, \\pi/2]$. The angle $\\theta=0$ is excluded as it would require infinite angular velocity from eq. \\eqref{eq:theta_dot_sq}. Angles $\\theta > \\pi/2$ are not considered as this would mean the contact point has left the table surface.\n\n**Derivation**:\nLet $u = \\sin\\theta$. Since $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi/2]$, the range for $u$ is $u \\in (0, 1]$. We need to minimize the part of eq. \\eqref{eq:E0_theta} that depends on $\\theta$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf(u) = \\frac{5+4u^2}{u} = \\frac{5}{u} + 4u\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo find the minimum, we take the derivative with respect to $u$ and set it to zero:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{df}{du} = -\\frac{5}{u^2} + 4\n\\end{align}\\]\nSetting $\\frac{df}{du}=0$ gives $u^2 = 5/4$, so $u = \\sqrt{5}/2 \\approx 1.118$. This value is outside the allowed interval $u \\in (0, 1]$. We must check the behavior of the function on the interval. For any $u \\in (0, 1]$, we have $u^2 < 1$, which implies $1/u^2 > 1$, and thus $5/u^2 > 5$. Therefore, $\\frac{df}{du} = 4 - 5/u^2 < 0$ for all $u \\in (0, 1]$.\nThis indicates that $f(u)$ is a strictly decreasing function on $(0, 1]$. The minimum value of $f(u)$ on this interval must occur at the right endpoint, $u=1$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf_{\\min} = f(1) = \\frac{5}{1} + 4(1) = 9\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis minimum corresponds to a lift-off angle of $\\theta = \\arcsin(1) = \\pi/2$. The minimum required initial energy is therefore:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nE_{0, \\min} = \\frac{mgr}{8} f_{\\min} = \\frac{9}{8}mgr\n\\end{align}\\]\nFinally, we use the relationship between $E_0$ and $v_0$ from eq. \\eqref{eq:E0} to find the minimum initial velocity:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{5}{8}mv_{0, \\min}^2 &= E_{0, \\min} = \\frac{9}{8}mgr \\nonumber \\\\\n5v_{0, \\min}^2 &= 9gr \\nonumber \\\\\nv_{0, \\min}^2 &= \\frac{9}{5}gr \\nonumber \\\\\nv_{0, \\min} &= \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{5}gr}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimum initial velocity of the center of mass required for the coin to leave the table is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{v_{0, \\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{5}gr}}\n\\end{align}\\]"}

A concentric spherical shell with inner radius $R_1=R$ and outer radius $R_2=2^{1/3}R$ is placed in a uniform external magnetic field. The shell material has a linear, isotropic, and homogeneous magnetic permeability $\\mu=3\\mu_0$. At the center of the shell (the origin), there is a magnetic dipole with moment $\\mathbf{m}$. The dipole moment $\\mathbf{m}$ is oriented at an angle $\\alpha$ with respect to the external magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0$. We are asked to calculate the magnitude of the torque experienced by the magnetic dipole.\n\nThe physical quantities and parameters are:\n*   Inner radius of the shell: $R_1 = R$.\n*   Outer radius of the shell: $R_2 = kR$, where $k = 2^{1/3}$, which implies $k^3 = 2$.\n*   Region 1 (cavity, $r < R_1$): Permeability $\\mu_0$.\n*   Region 2 (shell, $R_1 < r < R_2$): Permeability $\\mu = 3\\mu_0$. The relative permeability is $\\mu_r = \\mu/\\mu_0 = 3$.\n*   Region 3 (outside, $r > R_2$): Permeability $\\mu_0$.\n*   External uniform magnetic flux density: $\\mathbf{B}_0$. We align our coordinate system such that the z-axis is parallel to $\\mathbf{B}_0$, so $\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \\hat{z}$. The corresponding magnetic field intensity is $\\mathbf{H}_0 = \\mathbf{B}_0/\\mu_0$.\n*   Magnetic dipole moment: $\\mathbf{m}$, located at the origin ($r=0$). Its magnitude is $m$.\n*   Angle between $\\mathbf{m}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_0$: $\\alpha$.\n\nWe assume the system is in magnetostatic equilibrium and there are no free currents in the regions of interest. This allows us to use the magnetic scalar potential $\\varphi$, where the magnetic field intensity is defined as $\\mathbf{H} = -\\nabla\\varphi$. The goal is to find the magnitude of the torque, $\\tau$, on the dipole.\n\n### Step 1: Superposition Principle and Torque Calculation Strategy\nThe torque on a magnetic dipole $\\mathbf{m}$ is determined by the effective magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{eff}}$ at its location (the origin). The effective field is the field produced by all sources *other than* the dipole itself.\n\\[\\boxed{\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mathbf{m} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{eff}}}\\]\nSince the medium is linear, we can use the principle of superposition. The effective magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{eff}}$ at the origin is the sum of the fields from two sources: the external uniform field and the magnetization of the spherical shell. The shell's magnetization is induced by both the external field and the dipole's field. We can thus decompose the problem into two independent parts:\n1.  $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{ext,mod}}$: The field inside the cavity produced by the external source $\\mathbf{B}_0$ as modified by the presence of the magnetic shell.\n2.  $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{react}}$: The \"reaction\" field at the origin, produced by the shell's magnetization which is induced by the dipole $\\mathbf{m}$ itself.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{eff}} = \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{ext,mod}} + \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{react}}}\\]\nWe will calculate these two field contributions in the following steps. The total torque is then given by:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mathbf{m} \\times (\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{ext,mod}} + \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{react}}) = \\mathbf{m} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{ext,mod}} + \\mathbf{m} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{react}} \\label{eq:torque_superposition}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Modified External Field\nFirst, we find the magnetic field inside the cavity, $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{ext,mod}}$, when only the external field $\\mathbf{B}_0$ is present (i.e., setting $m=0$).\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nIn a current-free region ($\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{free}}=0$), Maxwell's equations for magnetostatics imply $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = 0$, which allows the definition of a magnetic scalar potential $\\mathbf{H} = -\\nabla\\varphi$. With $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ and the constitutive relation $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu\\mathbf{H}$, for a region of constant permeability $\\mu$, the potential satisfies Laplace's equation.\n\\[\\boxed{\\nabla^2\\varphi = 0}\\]\nThe boundary conditions at an interface between two media (a and b) without surface currents require the continuity of the tangential component of $\\mathbf{H}$ and the normal component of $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\\[\\boxed{\\mathbf{H}_{t,a} = \\mathbf{H}_{t,b} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\varphi_a = \\varphi_b \\quad (\\text{at the interface})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\mathbf{B}_{n,a} = \\mathbf{B}_{n,b} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\mu_a \\frac{\\partial\\varphi_a}{\\partial n} = \\mu_b \\frac{\\partial\\varphi_b}{\\partial n} \\quad (\\text{at the interface})}\\]\nThe potential for a uniform external field $\\mathbf{H}_0 = H_0\\hat{z}$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\varphi_{ext} = -H_0 z = -H_0 r\\cos\\theta}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe problem has azimuthal symmetry, so the general solution to Laplace's equation is a sum of Legendre polynomials. The external field has a $P_1(\\cos\\theta) = \\cos\\theta$ dependence, so the solution in all regions will be of the form $\\varphi(r, \\theta) = (Ar + B/r^2)\\cos\\theta$.\n*   Region 1 ($r < R$): $\\varphi_1(r, \\theta) = C_1 r \\cos\\theta$. (The $1/r^2$ term is excluded for finiteness at $r=0$).\n*   Region 2 ($R < r < kR$): $\\varphi_2(r, \\theta) = (C_2 r + D_2/r^2)\\cos\\theta$.\n*   Region 3 ($r > kR$): $\\varphi_3(r, \\theta) = (-H_0 r + D_3/r^2)\\cos\\theta$, where $H_0=B_0/\\mu_0$.

These balls are connected sequentially by three light, non-extensible strings, each of length `l`. The entire assembly hangs vertically from a ceiling, in equilibrium under gravity, where the gravitational acceleration is `g`.\n\nThe system is initially at rest. A hammer then strikes the topmost ball (the one closest to the ceiling) horizontally, imparting to it an instantaneous velocity `v_0`. The objective is to calculate the tension in the middle string at the very instant after the strike.\n\nLet's label the balls from top to bottom as Ball 1, Ball 2, and Ball 3. The strings are likewise labeled: String 1 connects the ceiling to Ball 1, String 2 connects Ball 1 to Ball 2, and String 3 connects Ball 2 to Ball 3. We are asked to find the tension `T_2` in String 2.\n\nWe will use a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin `(0,0)` at the pivot point on the ceiling. The x-axis is horizontal in the direction of the strike, and the y-axis is vertical, pointing upwards.\nThe initial positions of the balls at time `t=0` are:\n*   Ball 1: `(0, -l)`\n*   Ball 2: `(0, -2l)`\n*   Ball 3: `(0, -3l)`\n\nKey assumptions based on the problem statement:\n*   The strings are massless (\"light\") and non-extensible.\n*   The strike is instantaneous, meaning the impulse is delivered over a negligible time interval, and the positions of the balls do not change during the strike.\n*   A critical consequence of the strings being non-extensible is that immediately after the strike, the entire system must move as a single rigid body rotating about the pivot point at the ceiling.\n\n### Step 1: Kinematic Analysis of the System at the Instant of Impact\nImmediately after the horizontal strike on Ball 1, the non-extensible strings force the entire system to begin rotating about the pivot at the ceiling. As the system was initially a straight vertical line, all three balls must share the same instantaneous angular velocity, `ω`, about the pivot.\n\nThe relationship between linear speed `v`, angular velocity `ω`, and radius `r` for an object in circular motion is a fundamental kinematic principle.\n\\[\\boxed{v = \\omega r}\\]\nThe topmost ball (Ball 1) is at a distance `r_1 = l` from the pivot and is given an instantaneous horizontal velocity `v_1 = v_0`. We can use this to find the angular velocity of the system.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_1 &= \\omega r_1 \\nonumber \\\\\nv_0 &= \\omega l \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega &= \\frac{v_0}{l} \\label{eq:omega} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe instantaneous horizontal velocities of the other two balls are then determined by their respective distances from the pivot:\n*   Ball 2 is at `r_2 = 2l`, so its velocity is `v_2 = \\omega r_2 = \\left(\\frac{v_0}{l}\\right)(2l) = 2v_0`.\n*   Ball 3 is at `r_3 = 3l`, so its velocity is `v_3 = \\omega r_3 = \\left(\\frac{v_0}{l}\\right)(3l) = 3v_0`.\n\nFor an object in circular motion, its acceleration vector `\\vec{a}` can be decomposed into a centripetal (radial) component `\\vec{a}_c` and a tangential component `\\vec{a}_t`.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{a} = \\vec{a}_c + \\vec{a}_t}\\]\nThe magnitudes of these components are given by:\n\\[\\boxed{a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} = \\omega^2 r}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{a_t = r \\alpha}\\]\nwhere `\\alpha` is the angular acceleration. At the instant of the strike (`t=0+`), the balls are on the negative y-axis. The centripetal acceleration is therefore directed towards the center of rotation (the origin), i.e., in the positive y-direction. The tangential acceleration is perpendicular to the radius, i.e., in the horizontal x-direction.\n\nFor ball `i` at radius `r_i = il`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\na_{iy} = a_{c,i} &= \\omega^2 r_i = \\left(\\frac{v_0}{l}\\right)^2 (il) = i \\frac{v_0^2}{l} \\quad (\\text{upward}) \\label{eq:ay} \\tag{2} \\\\\na_{ix} = a_{t,i} &= \\alpha r_i = \\alpha (il) \\quad (\\text{horizontal}) \\label{eq:ax} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determination of Instantaneous Angular Acceleration\nTo find the tangential (horizontal) accelerations, we must first determine the angular acceleration `\\alpha` of the system at this instant. We apply Newton's second law for rotation about the pivot point.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{net, ext}} = I \\vec{\\alpha}}\\]\nHere, `\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{net, ext}}` is the net external torque on the system of three balls, and `I` is the total moment of inertia of the system about the pivot. The definition of torque is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}}\\]\nThe external forces acting on the system are the gravitational force on each ball (`\\vec{F}_{g,i}`) and the tension from the ceiling acting on Ball 1 (`\\vec{T}_1`). At the instant `t=0+`, the position vector for ball `i` is `\\vec{r}_i = -il\\hat{j}` and the gravitational force is `\\vec{F}_{g,i} = -mg\\hat{j}`. The torque due to gravity on each ball is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\vec{\\tau}_{g,i} = \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_{g,i} = (-il\\hat{j}) \\times (-mg\\hat{j}) = 0 \\label{eq:torque_g} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe tension `\\vec{T}_1` from the ceiling also acts along the y-axis, so its line of action passes through the pivot. Thus, its torque is also zero. The net external torque on the system at this instant is therefore zero.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{net, ext}} = \\sum_i \\vec{\\tau}_{g,i} + \\vec{\\tau}_{T_1} = \\vec{0} \\label{eq:net_torque} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe moment of inertia of the system of three point masses is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{I = \\sum_{i} m_i r_i^2}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\nI &= m r_1^2 + m r_2^2 + m r_3^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= m(l^2 + (2l)^2 + (3l)^2) = m(l^2 + 4l^2 + 9l^2) = 14ml^2 \\label{eq:inertia} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSince `I` is non-zero and `\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{net, ext}} = \\vec{0}`, the angular acceleration `\\vec{\\alpha}` must be zero.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\vec{\\alpha} = 0 \\label{eq:alpha} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFrom Eq. \\eqref{eq:ax}, this implies that the instantaneous tangential (horizontal) acceleration for all three balls is zero (`a_{ix} = 0`). The only non-zero component of acceleration at this instant is the vertical (centripetal) component.\n\n### Step 3: Dynamic Analysis of the Bottom Ball (Ball 3)\nWe apply Newton's second law to find the tension `T_3` in the bottom string (String 3). We only need to consider the forces and acceleration in the vertical (y) direction.\n\\[\\boxed{\\sum \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}}\\]\nThe forces acting on Ball 3 in the y-direction are the tension `T_3` from String 3 (acting upwards, `+T_3\\hat{j}`) and gravity `mg` (acting downwards, `-mg\\hat{j}`). The vertical acceleration `a_{3y}` is directed upwards.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum F_{3y} &= T_3 - mg = m a_{3y} \\nonumber \\\\\nT_3 - mg &= m \\left(3 \\frac{v_0^2}{l}\\right) \\quad (\\text{using Eq. \\ref{eq:ay} for i=3}) \\nonumber \\\\\nT_3 &= mg + 3m\\frac{v_0^2}{l} \\label{eq:T3} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 4: Dynamic Analysis of the Middle Ball (Ball 2) to Find the Tension\nNow we apply Newton's second law to the middle ball (Ball 2) to find the tension `T_2` in the middle string (String 2).\n\\[\\boxed{\\sum \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}}\\]\nThe forces acting on Ball 2 in the y-direction are the tension `T_2` from String 2 (upwards, `+T_2\\hat{j}`), the tension `T_3` from String 3 (downwards, `-T_3\\hat{j}`), and gravity `mg` (downwards, `-mg\\hat{j}`). The vertical acceleration `a_{2y}` is directed upwards.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum F_{2y} &= T_2 - T_3 - mg = m a_{2y} \\nonumber \\\\\nT_2 - T_3 - mg &= m \\left(2 \\frac{v_0^2}{l}\\right) \\quad (\\text{using Eq. \\ref{eq:ay} for i=2}) \\nonumber \\\\\nT_2 &= T_3 + mg + 2m\\frac{v_0^2}{l} \\label{eq:T2_intermediate} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting the expression for `T_3` from Eq. \\eqref{eq:T3} into Eq. \\eqref{eq:T2_intermediate}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nT_2 &= \\left(mg + 3m\\frac{v_0^2}{l}\\right) + mg + 2m\\frac{v_0^2}{l} \\nonumber \\\\\nT_2 &= 2mg + 5m\\frac{v_0^2}{l} \\label{eq:T2_final} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe instantaneous tension in the middle string when the topmost ball is struck is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{T_2 = 2mg + 5m\\frac{v_0^2}{l}}\n\\end{align}\\]"}

This is the first quadrant of the $xy$-plane, extending infinitely in the positive and negative $z$ directions.\n2.  **Conductor Region**: The rest of space, i.e., the region where $x \\le 0$ or $y \\le 0$.\n\nThe conductor and vacuum meet at two surfaces which are semi-infinite planes forming a 90-degree corner:\n*   The plane defined by $y=0$ for $x \\ge 0$.\n*   The plane defined by $x=0$ for $y \\ge 0$.\n\nA point charge, with charge $q$, is fixed at a point $(a, b, c)$ within the vacuum region, which means its coordinates satisfy $a > 0$ and $b > 0$. The system is in electrostatic equilibrium. This implies that the electric field inside the conductor is zero, and its surface is an equipotential surface. We make the standard assumption that the conductor is grounded, which means its potential is held at zero. This provides the following boundary conditions for the electric potential $V$ in the vacuum region:\n*   $V(x, 0, z) = 0$ for all $x \\ge 0$ and all $z$.\n*   $V(0, y, z) = 0$ for all $y \\ge 0$ and all $z$.\n\nThe goal is to find the magnitude of the electric field intensity, denoted as $|\\vec{E}(x, +0, z)|$, on the surface of the conductor in the $xOz$ plane. The notation $(x, +0, z)$ indicates a point $(x, y, z)$ on the $xOz$ plane approached from the vacuum region, i.e., in the limit $y \\to 0^+$, for $x>0$.\n\n### Step 1: The Method of Images\nTo find the electric field in the vacuum region, we use the method of images. This method replaces the conductor with a set of fictitious point charges (image charges) located in the region originally occupied by the conductor. The configuration of these image charges is chosen such that the potential they create, combined with the potential from the original charge, satisfies the boundary conditions on the conductor's surface. The uniqueness theorem of electrostatics guarantees that this approach yields the correct electric field in the vacuum region.\n\nThe principles for this step are the boundary condition for a grounded conductor and the superposition principle for electric potential.\n\\[\\boxed{V(\\text{on grounded conductor surface}) = 0}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{V_{\\text{total}}(\\vec{r}) = \\sum_i V_i(\\vec{r}) = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q_i}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_i|}}\\]\n\nFor a 90-degree conducting corner, three image charges are required. The positions and charges are determined by reflection across the conducting planes. The system of four charges is as follows:\n*   **Original charge:** $q_1 = +q$ at position $\\vec{r}'_1 = (a, b, c)$.\n*   **Image charge 1:** $q_2 = -q$ at position $\\vec{r}'_2 = (a, -b, c)$ (reflection of $q_1$ across the $y=0$ plane).\n*   **Image charge 2:** $q_3 = -q$ at position $\\vec{r}'_3 = (-a, b, c)$ (reflection of $q_1$ across the $x=0$ plane).\n*   **Image charge 3:** $q_4 = +q$ at position $\\vec{r}'_4 = (-a, -b, c)$ (reflection of $q_2$ across the $x=0$ plane).\n\nThe total potential from these four charges at a point $\\vec{r}=(x,y,z)$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2}} - \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y+b)^2+(z-c)^2}} - \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2}} + \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2+(y+b)^2+(z-c)^2}} \\right] \\label{eq:potential} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis potential satisfies the boundary conditions:\n*   On the plane $y=0$: The first and second terms cancel, and the third and fourth terms cancel, yielding $V(x,0,z) = 0$.\n*   On the plane $x=0$: The first and third terms cancel, and the second and fourth terms cancel, yielding $V(0,y,z) = 0$.\nThus, this configuration of charges correctly models the problem in the vacuum region $x>0, y>0$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Electric Field Vector\nThe electric field in the vacuum region is the vector sum of the fields produced by the original charge and the three image charges. We will calculate this field at a point $\\vec{r} = (x, 0, z)$ on the $xOz$ surface.\n\nThe primary principles for this step are the superposition principle for electric fields and Coulomb's law.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{E}_{\\text{total}}(\\vec{r}) = \\sum_i \\vec{E}_i(\\vec{r})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{E}_i(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q_i (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_i)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_i|^3}}\\]\nIn electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field at the surface of a conductor must be perpendicular to the surface. For the $xOz$ plane, the normal direction is the $\\hat{y}$ direction. We will verify this by direct calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the total electric field at $\\vec{r}=(x,0,z)$ by summing the contributions from the four charges. The displacement vectors from the charges to the point $\\vec{r}$ are:\n*   $\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_1 = (x-a, -b, z-c)$\n*   $\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_2 = (x-a, b, z-c)$\n*   $\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_3 = (x+a, -b, z-c)$\n*   $\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_4 = (x+a, b, z-c)$\n\nLet's define the squared distances from the charges to $\\vec{r}$:\n*   $d_1^2 = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_1|^2 = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_2|^2 = (x-a)^2 + b^2 + (z-c)^2$\n*   $d_2^2 = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_3|^2 = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'_4|^2 = (x+a)^2 + b^2 + (z-c)^2$\n\nNow, we sum the electric field vectors:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{E}(x, 0, z) &= \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q_1(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'_1)}{d_1^3} + \\frac{q_2(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'_2)}{d_1^3} + \\frac{q_3(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'_3)}{d_2^3} + \\frac{q_4(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'_4)}{d_2^3} \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{(x-a, -b, z-c)}{d_1^3} - \\frac{(x-a, b, z-c)}{d_1^3} - \\frac{(x+a, -b, z-c)}{d_2^3} + \\frac{(x+a, b, z-c)}{d_2^3} \\right] \\label{eq:E_vector_sum} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nExamining the components of the total field:\n*   $E_x = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{x-a}{d_1^3} - \\frac{x-a}{d_1^3} - \\frac{x+a}{d_2^3} + \\frac{x+a}{d_2^3} \\right) = 0$\n*   $E_z = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{z-c}{d_1^3} - \\frac{z-c}{d_1^3} - \\frac{z-c}{d_2^3} + \\frac{z-c}{d_2^3} \\right) = 0$\n*   $E_y = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{-b}{d_1^3} - \\frac{b}{d_1^3} - \\frac{-b}{d_2^3} + \\frac{b}{d_2^3} \\right) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{-2b}{d_1^3} + \\frac{2b}{d_2^3} \\right) = \\frac{qb}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{d_2^3} - \\frac{1}{d_1^3} \\right)$\n\nAs expected, the tangential components ($E_x, E_z$) are zero. The electric field vector on the $xOz$ plane is normal to the surface:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{E}(x, +0, z) = \\frac{qb}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{((x+a)^2 + b^2 + (z-c)^2)^{3/2}} - \\frac{1}{((x-a)^2 + b^2 + (z-c)^2)^{3/2}} \\right] \\hat{y}\n\\label{eq:E_vector} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Magnitude of the Electric Field\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this field. The magnitude of a vector is its length, which is always a non-negative value.\n\\[\\boxed{|\\vec{A}| = \\sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2}}\\]\nFor our electric field vector $\\vec{E} = E_y \\hat{y}$, the magnitude is simply $|\\vec{E}| = |E_y|$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|\\vec{E}(x, +0, z)| &= |E_y| = \\left| \\frac{qb}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{d_2^3} - \\frac{1}{d_1^3} \\right) \\right| \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{|q|b}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left| \\frac{1}{d_2^3} - \\frac{1}{d_1^3} \\right| \\label{eq:E_mag_start} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nHere we use $|q|$ because magnitude must be non-negative, regardless of the sign of the charge $q$. We also know $b>0$.\nNow we compare the magnitudes of $d_1$ and $d_2$. Since $x>0$ and $a>0$, we have $(x+a) > |x-a|$, which implies $(x+a)^2 > (x-a)^2$.\nFrom their definitions, this means $d_2^2 > d_1^2$. Since distances are positive, $d_2 > d_1$.\nConsequently, $d_2^3 > d_1^3$, which leads to $\\frac{1}{d_2^3} < \\frac{1}{d_1^3}$.\nTherefore, the term $\\left( \\frac{1}{d_2^3} - \\frac{1}{d_1^3} \\right)$ is negative. Its absolute value is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left| \\frac{1}{d_2^3} - \\frac{1}{d_1^3} \\right| = -\\left( \\frac{1}{d_2^3} - \\frac{1}{d_1^3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{d_1^3} - \\frac{1}{d_2^3}\n\\label{eq:dist_mag} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting this back into Eq. \\eqref{eq:E_mag_start}, we get the magnitude of the electric field:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|\\vec{E}(x, +0, z)| &= \\frac{|q|b}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{d_1^3} - \\frac{1}{d_2^3} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{|q|b}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{((x-a)^2 + b^2 + (z-c)^2)^{3/2}} - \\frac{1}{((x+a)^2 + b^2 + (z-c)^2)^{3/2}} \\right]\n\\label{eq:E_mag_final} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe magnitude of the electric field intensity on the surface of the conductor at the $xOz$ plane, $|\\vec{E}(x, +0, z)|$, is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{|\\vec{E}(x, +0, z)| = \\frac{|q|b}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\left((x-a)^2 + b^2 + (z-c)^2\\right)^{3/2}} - \\frac{1}{\\left((x+a)^2 + b^2 + (z-c)^2\\right)^{3/2}} \\right]}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The space between the cylinders is assumed to be a vacuum, so heat transfer occurs solely through radiation.\n\nThe key components, variables, and assumptions are:\n*   **Inner Cylinder (Surface 1):** An opaque, solid cylinder of radius `r`. Its surface is maintained at a constant, uniform temperature `T₁`.\n*   **Outer Cylinder (Surface 2):** An opaque, hollow cylinder with an inner radius `R`. Its inner surface is maintained at a constant, uniform temperature `T₂`.\n*   **Geometric Configuration:** The cylinders are infinitely long, allowing for a two-dimensional analysis of their cross-section. Their axes are parallel and separated by a distance `b`. The given constraints `r < b < R` and `r + b < R` ensure that the inner cylinder is fully enclosed within the outer one without any contact.\n*   **Physical Properties:** Both cylinders are treated as ideal black bodies. This means their emissivity (`ε`) and absorptivity (`α`) are equal to 1. They emit thermal radiation diffusely according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law and absorb all incident radiation.\n*   **Heat Source:** To maintain the outer cylinder at a constant temperature `T₂`, an external heat source provides or removes power.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the power per unit area, `p(θ)`, that the external heat source must supply to the inner surface of the outer cylinder at a specific angular position `θ`.\n*   **Coordinate System:** The angle `θ` specifies a point on the inner surface of the outer cylinder. It is the angle between the line connecting the centers of the two cylinders and the line from the center of the outer cylinder to the point of interest.\n*   **Constant:** The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is denoted by `σ`.\n\n### Step 1: Energy Balance on a Surface Element of the Outer Cylinder\nTo maintain the outer cylinder's surface at a constant temperature `T₂`, the energy flow for any differential area element `dS₂` on this surface must be balanced. This is a direct application of the First Law of Thermodynamics for a control volume at steady state. The power supplied by the external source, `p(θ)dS₂`, plus the radiative energy absorbed must equal the radiative energy emitted.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nThe steady-state energy balance for a control volume is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\dot{E}_{\\text{in}} = \\dot{E}_{\\text{out}}}\\]\nFor a surface element `dS`, the rates of energy in and out are given by the supplied power, irradiation (incoming radiative flux, `G`), and radiosity (outgoing radiative flux, `J`). For a black body, the radiosity is equal to the blackbody emissive power, `E_b`.\n\\[\\boxed{J = E_b = \\sigma T^4}\\]\nThe irradiation `G` on a differential surface element `di` within an enclosure is the sum of radiation received from all surrounding surfaces `j`. For diffuse surfaces (which black bodies are), this is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{G_{di} = \\sum_{j} J_j F_{di \\to j}}\\]\nwhere `F_{di \\to j}` is the view factor from `di` to surface `j`. For any element `di` inside an enclosure, the view factors to all surfaces in the enclosure must sum to unity.\n\\[\\boxed{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{di \\to j} = 1}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nLet's apply the energy balance to a differential element `dS₂` at angle `θ` on the outer cylinder. The energy inputs are the power from the source `p(\\theta)dS₂` and the incident radiation `G_2 dS₂`. The energy output is the emitted radiation `J_2 dS₂`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\dot{E}_{\\text{in}} &= p(\\theta)dS_2 + G_2 dS_2 \\label{eq:energy_in} \\tag{1} \\\\\n\\dot{E}_{\\text{out}} &= J_2 dS_2 \\label{eq:energy_out} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nAt steady state, `\\dot{E}_{\\text{in}} = \\dot{E}_{\\text{out}}`, so:\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(\\theta)dS_2 + G_2 dS_2 &= J_2 dS_2 \\nonumber \\\\\np(\\theta) &= J_2 - G_2 \\label{eq:power_balance} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe enclosure for `dS₂` consists of the inner cylinder (surface 1) and the entire inner surface of the outer cylinder (surface 2). The irradiation `G₂` on `dS₂` is the sum of radiation from surface 1 and surface 2.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nG_2 = J_1 F_{d2 \\to 1} + J_2 F_{d2 \\to 2} \\label{eq:irradiation} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing the summation rule for view factors from `dS₂`: `F_{d2 \\to 1} + F_{d2 \\to 2} = 1`, which gives `F_{d2 \\to 2} = 1 - F_{d2 \\to 1}`. Substituting this into Eq. \\eqref{eq:irradiation}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nG_2 = J_1 F_{d2 \\to 1} + J_2 (1 - F_{d2 \\to 1}) \\label{eq:irradiation_sub} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow, substitute this expression for `G₂` into the power balance Eq. \\eqref{eq:power_balance}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(\\theta) &= J_2 - \\left[ J_1 F_{d2 \\to 1} + J_2 (1 - F_{d2 \\to 1}) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= J_2 - J_1 F_{d2 \\to 1} - J_2 + J_2 F_{d2 \\to 1} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (J_2 - J_1) F_{d2 \\to 1} \\label{eq:power_density_intermediate} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSince both surfaces are black bodies, their radiosities are `J_1 = \\sigma T_1^4` and `J_2 = \\sigma T_2^4`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(\\theta) = (\\sigma T_2^4 - \\sigma T_1^4) F_{d2 \\to 1} = \\sigma(T_2^4 - T_1^4) F_{d2 \\to 1} \\label{eq:power_density_pre} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the view factor `F_{d2 \\to 1}` from the element `dS₂` to the inner cylinder.\n\n### Step 2: Geometric Setup for View Factor Calculation\nTo calculate the view factor, we first establish a 2D Cartesian coordinate system in the cross-sectional plane of the cylinders.\n*   The center of the outer cylinder (radius `R`) is placed at the origin `O(0,0)`.\n*   The center of the inner cylinder (radius `r`) is placed on the x-axis at `C₁(b,0)`.\n*   A point `P` on the outer cylinder's inner surface, corresponding to the location of `dS₂`, is described by the angle `θ`. Its coordinates are `P(R\\cos\\theta, R\\sin\\theta)`.\n\nThe distance `D` between point `P` and the axis of the inner cylinder (passing through `C₁`) is a key geometric parameter.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nThe distance between two points `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)` in a Cartesian plane is given by the distance formula, which is an application of the Pythagorean theorem. Equivalently, we can use the Law of Cosines for the triangle formed by the points `O`, `C₁`, and `P`.\n\\[\\boxed{c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos\\gamma}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nApplying the Law of Cosines to triangle `OC₁P`, the side `D = PC₁` can be found. The lengths of the other sides are `OP = R` and `OC₁ = b`. The angle `\\angle C₁OP` is `θ`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nD^2 &= R^2 + b^2 - 2Rb\\cos\\theta \\label{eq:distance_D} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the View Factor F_{d2→1}\nThe view factor `F_{d2 \\to 1}` depends on the geometry relating the differential element `dS₂` at point `P` and the entire infinite inner cylinder.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nFor a 2D geometry involving an infinitely long cylinder, the view factor from a differential surface element `dA` to the cylinder is given by a standard formula in radiative heat transfer:\n\\[\\boxed{F_{dA \\to \\text{cyl}} = \\frac{r}{s} \\cos\\psi}\\]\nHere, `r` is the radius of the target cylinder, `s` is the distance from the element `dA` to the cylinder's axis, and `\\psi` is the angle between the surface normal of `dA` and the line connecting `dA` to the cylinder's axis.\nTo find `\\cos\\psi`, we use the definition of the dot product of two vectors `\\vec{a}` and `\\vec{b}`:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = |\\vec{a}| |\\vec{b}| \\cos\\psi}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nWe apply the view factor formula to our system.

Inside the rocket, a testing apparatus is placed in a smooth groove. We are asked to find the height `h` the rocket has reached when the pressure exerted by the apparatus on the groove is a specific multiple of the pressure at liftoff.\n\nThe given information and defined variables are as follows:\n*   **Physical Scenario**: A rocket accelerates vertically upwards from the Earth's surface (`h=0`).\n*   `a`: The constant upward acceleration of the rocket, given by the relation `a = k_1 g_0`.\n*   `k_1`: A given dimensionless constant.\n*   `g_0`: The gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface.\n*   `R`: The radius of the Earth.\n*   `h`: The height of the rocket above the Earth's surface, which we need to find.\n*   `m`: The mass of the testing apparatus inside the rocket. This is an auxiliary variable that will cancel out.\n*   `N_1`: The normal force exerted by the groove on the apparatus at liftoff (`h=0`). By Newton's third law, its magnitude is equal to the pressure exerted by the apparatus on the groove.\n*   `N_2`: The normal force exerted by the groove on the apparatus at height `h`.\n*   `k_2`: A given dimensionless constant that relates the two normal forces via the equation `N_2 = k_2 N_1`.\n\nWe make the following standard assumptions:\n*   The Earth is a uniform, non-rotating sphere.\n*   The groove is \"smooth,\" which implies there is no friction between the apparatus and the groove.\n*   The analysis is performed in an inertial reference frame fixed to the Earth's surface.\n\nThe goal is to derive an expression for `h` in terms of the given quantities `R`, `k_1`, and `k_2`.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Normal Force at Liftoff (h=0)\nFirst, we analyze the forces acting on the testing apparatus at the moment of liftoff (`h=0`) to determine the initial normal force, `N_1`. We define a coordinate system with the positive y-axis pointing vertically upwards from the launch point.\n\nThe physical principles applied in this step are Newton's Second Law and the formula for gravitational force at the Earth's surface.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sum F_y = ma_y}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{F_g = mg_0 \\quad (\\text{at } h=0)}\n\\]\nThe forces acting on the apparatus are the upward normal force `N_1` from the groove and the downward gravitational force `F_{g,0} = mg_0`. The net force in the y-direction is `N_1 - mg_0`. The apparatus has a constant upward acceleration `a_y = a = k_1 g_0`. Applying Newton's Second Law:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum F_y &= ma_y \\nonumber \\\\\nN_1 - mg_0 &= m(k_1 g_0) \\label{eq:newton_1} \\tag{1} \\\\\nN_1 &= mg_0 + mk_1 g_0 \\nonumber \\\\\nN_1 &= mg_0(1 + k_1) \\label{eq:N1} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Normal Force at Height h\nNext, we analyze the forces on the apparatus when the rocket has reached an altitude `h`. This requires finding the gravitational acceleration at that height, `g(h)`.\n\nThe principles for this step are Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which describes how the gravitational field varies with distance, and Newton's Second Law.\n\\[\n\\boxed{g(r) = \\frac{GM_E}{r^2}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sum F_y = ma_y}\n\\]\nFirst, we derive the expression for `g(h)`. At height `h`, the distance from the Earth's center is `r = R+h`. At the surface (`h=0`), the distance is `r=R`, and the gravitational acceleration is `g_0 = GM_E/R^2`. From this, we can express the product `GM_E` as `g_0 R^2`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ng(h) &= \\frac{GM_E}{(R+h)^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{g_0 R^2}{(R+h)^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= g_0 \\left(\\frac{R}{R+h}\\right)^2 \\label{eq:gh} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we apply Newton's Second Law to the apparatus at height `h`. The forces are the new upward normal force `N_2` and the new downward gravitational force `F_{g,h} = mg(h)`. The rocket's acceleration remains constant at `a_y = a = k_1 g_0`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum F_y &= ma_y \\nonumber \\\\\nN_2 - mg(h) &= m(k_1 g_0) \\label{eq:newton_2} \\tag{4} \\\\\nN_2 &= mg(h) + m(k_1 g_0) \\nonumber \\\\\nN_2 &= m \\left[ g_0 \\left(\\frac{R}{R+h}\\right)^2 \\right] + m(k_1 g_0) \\quad (\\text{using eq. \\ref{eq:gh}}) \\nonumber \\\\\nN_2 &= mg_0 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{R}{R+h}\\right)^2 + k_1 \\right] \\label{eq:N2} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the Height h\nFinally, we use the condition given in the problem, which relates the normal force at height `h` to the normal force at liftoff, to solve for `h`.\n\nThe principle for this step is the given relationship between `N_1` and `N_2`:\n\\[\n\\boxed{N_2 = k_2 N_1}\n\\]\nWe substitute the expressions for `N_1` (from eq. \\ref{eq:N1}) and `N_2` (from eq. \\ref{eq:N2}) into this relation.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nmg_0 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{R}{R+h}\\right)^2 + k_1 \\right] &= k_2 \\left[ mg_0(1 + k_1) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{R}{R+h}\\right)^2 + k_1 &= k_2 (1 + k_1) \\quad (\\text{canceling } mg_0) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{R}{R+h}\\right)^2 &= k_2 (1 + k_1) - k_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{R}{R+h} &= \\sqrt{k_2(1+k_1) - k_1} \\quad (\\text{taking the positive square root as R and R+h are positive}) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{R+h}{R} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k_2(1+k_1) - k_1}} \\quad (\\text{inverting both sides}) \\nonumber \\\\\n1 + \\frac{h}{R} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k_2(1+k_1) - k_1}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{h}{R} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k_2(1+k_1) - k_1}} - 1 \\nonumber \\\\\nh &= R \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k_2(1+k_1) - k_1}} - 1 \\right) \\label{eq:final_h} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe height `h` reached by the rocket is given by the expression:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{h = R \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k_2(1+k_1) - k_1}} - 1 \\right)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The derivation is to be based on the classical oscillator model of atoms.\n\nThe physical situation involves the following components and parameters:\n*   **Incident Light**: A monochromatic, parallel beam of light with angular frequency $\\omega$. The intensity of the light is denoted by $I$. The interaction with the medium is driven by the light's electric field, which can be represented as a plane wave $E(t) = \\text{Re}[E_0 e^{i\\omega t}]$, where $E_0$ is the field amplitude.\n*   **Medium**: A uniform medium characterized by a number density of electrons, $N$ (number of electrons per unit volume), and a refractive index $n$.\n*   **Atomic Model (Classical Oscillator)**: Each atom is modeled as a stationary nucleus with a bound electron. The electron has mass $m$ and charge $-e$. Its motion, described by its displacement $x$ from equilibrium, is governed by three forces:\n    1.  A linear restoring force from the nucleus: $F_r = -m\\omega_0^2 x$, where $\\omega_0$ is the natural angular frequency of the oscillator.\n    2.  A damping force: $F_d = -m\\gamma v$, where $\\gamma$ is the damping constant and $v = \\dot{x}$ is the electron's velocity. This force is responsible for energy dissipation.\n    3.  A driving force from the light's electric field: $F_E = (-e)E(t)$.\n*   **Absorption Coefficient ($\\alpha$)**: This coefficient is defined by the differential relation describing the exponential decay of light intensity within the medium: $-dI = \\alpha I dx$, where $dI$ is the change in intensity over an infinitesimal thickness $dx$.\n*   **Physical Interpretation of Absorption**: The problem asks for the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$, which quantifies the energy lost from the light beam and dissipated (e.g., as heat) within the medium. In the given model, this energy dissipation is caused by the work done against the damping force. The problem also provides the Larmor formula for the power radiated by an accelerating charge, which describes energy *scattered* by the electron. This is a different physical process from absorption. Therefore, to find $\\alpha$, we must calculate the power *absorbed* and dissipated due to the damping mechanism.\n*   **Assumptions**: We assume the medium is dilute, such that its refractive index $n \\approx 1$.

This phenomenon is a result of capillarity, driven by surface tension. The liquid is in static equilibrium within a large container, under a uniform atmosphere.\n\nThe physical parameters and variables involved are:\n*   `h`: The height of the liquid at the wall relative to the flat liquid surface far from the wall. This is the quantity to be determined.\n*   `θ`: The contact angle between the liquid surface and the vertical wall, measured within the liquid. It is given that `0 < θ < π/2`.\n*   `ρ`: The density of the liquid.\n*   `σ`: The surface tension coefficient of the liquid.\n*   `p₀`: The uniform atmospheric pressure acting on the entire liquid surface.\n*   `g`: The acceleration due to gravity.\n\nWe establish a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system `(x, z)` to model the profile of the liquid surface:\n*   The `z`-axis is oriented vertically upwards and coincides with the container wall.\n*   The `x`-axis is horizontal and perpendicular to the wall, pointing into the liquid (`x > 0`).\n*   The plane `z=0` represents the level of the undisturbed, flat liquid surface far from the wall.\n*   The function `z(x)` describes the height of the liquid surface at a horizontal distance `x` from the wall.\n\nFrom this setup, we define the boundary conditions for the function `z(x)`:\n*   At the wall (`x=0`), the height is `z(0) = h`.\n*   Far from the wall (`x → ∞`), the liquid surface is flat, so its height approaches the reference level: `z(x) → 0` as `x → ∞`.\n*   Consequently, the slope of the surface also vanishes far from the wall: `z'(x) → 0` as `x → ∞`.\n\nWe assume the problem can be modeled in two dimensions, which is a valid approximation for a container that is long in the direction parallel to the wall, making the liquid surface cylindrical.\n\n### Step 1: Formulating the Differential Equation for the Liquid Surface\nThe shape of the liquid surface `z(x)` is determined by the condition of static equilibrium, which requires a balance between the pressure difference across the curved surface (capillary pressure) and the hydrostatic pressure variation due to gravity.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n1.  **Young-Laplace Equation**: The pressure difference (`Δp`) across a curved fluid interface is related to the surface tension (`σ`) and the principal radii of curvature (`R₁`, `R₂`).\n    \\[\\boxed{\\Delta p = \\sigma \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)}\\]\n2.  **Hydrostatic Pressure Equation**: In a static fluid under uniform gravity, the rate of change of pressure `p` with vertical depth `z` is given by:\n    \\[\\boxed{\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\rho g}\\]\n3.  **Radius of Curvature Formula**: The radius of curvature `R` for a curve defined by `z(x)` in a Cartesian coordinate system is given by:\n    \\[\\boxed{R = \\frac{(1+z'(x)^{2})^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\mid z''(x)\\mid}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nConsider a point `(x, z(x))` on the liquid surface. The pressure just above the surface is the constant atmospheric pressure `p₀`. The pressure just below the surface, `p_{below}`, is different due to the curvature.\nFor our setup, the liquid surface is cylindrical (straight and infinitely long in the direction parallel to the wall). Thus, one principal radius of curvature is infinite (`R₂ → ∞`), and the other, `R₁`, is the radius of curvature `R(x)` in the `x-z` plane. The Young-Laplace equation simplifies to `Δp = σ/R(x)`. The pressure is lower on the concave side of the meniscus, so the pressure just below the surface is `p_{below} = p₀ - σ/R(x)`.\n\nNext, we determine the hydrostatic pressure `p_{hydro}` at height `z` within the liquid. Integrating the hydrostatic pressure equation `dp = -ρg dz` from the reference level `z=0` (where pressure is `p₀`) to a height `z` gives `p(z) - p₀ = -ρgz`. Thus, the hydrostatic pressure at height `z(x)` is `p_{hydro}(z(x)) = p₀ - ρgz(x)`.\n\nIn static equilibrium, the pressure at any point in the fluid must be consistent. Therefore, at the surface `z(x)`, the pressure just below the interface must equal the hydrostatic pressure at that height:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_{below} &= p_{hydro}(z(x)) \\nonumber \\\\\np₀ - \\frac{\\sigma}{R(x)} &= p₀ - \\rho g z(x) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{\\sigma}{R(x)} &= \\rho g z(x) \\label{eq:pressure_balance} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe liquid rises at the wall (`h>0`) and flattens out far away (`z(∞)=0`), so the surface is concave up. This means the second derivative `z''(x)` is positive for all `x>0`. Therefore, `|z''(x)| = z''(x)`. Substituting the formula for the radius of curvature `R(x)` into Eq. \\eqref{eq:pressure_balance}, we obtain the differential equation for the surface profile `z(x)`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\sigma z''(x)}{(1+z'(x)^2)^{3/2}} = \\rho g z(x) \\label{eq:diff_eq_raw} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nRearranging this gives the form we will work with:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nz(x) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\rho g} \\frac{z''(x)}{(1+z'(x)^2)^{3/2}} \\label{eq:diff_eq} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Integrating the Differential Equation\nTo find an algebraic relationship involving `h`, we integrate the differential equation. A standard technique for this type of equation is to first multiply by `z'(x)` and then integrate over the domain of `x`.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n1.

The limits of integration for `z` are from `z(0)=h` to `z(∞)=0`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{LHS} = \\int_{h}^{0} z \\,dz = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}z^2 \\right]_{h}^{0} = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}h^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}h^2 \\label{eq:lhs_result} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor the right-hand side (RHS), we use the substitution `u = z'(x)`, which gives `du = z''(x)dx`.

By definition, the slope at the wall is `z'(0) = tan(φ)`. Since the liquid rises at the wall (`h>0`) and `z(x)` decreases as `x` increases, the slope `z'(0)` must be negative. This implies `φ` is an angle in the fourth quadrant, `φ ∈ (-π/2, 0)`.\n\nThe contact angle `θ` is the angle between the vertical wall (the positive z-axis) and the tangent to the liquid surface, measured within the liquid (`x>0`). Consider the right-angled triangle formed by the tangent line, the vertical wall, and a horizontal line at the contact point. The angle `θ` and the acute angle the tangent makes with the horizontal, `|φ|`, are the two non-right angles in this triangle. Therefore, they are complementary:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\theta + |\\phi| = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\label{eq:angle_relation_geom} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince `φ` is a negative angle, `|φ| = -φ`.

The figure consists of a head, a torso, two arms, and two legs, connected by hinges. The arms are actively driven to oscillate, which induces a passive oscillation in the legs. The objective is to find the amplitude of the steady-state oscillation of the legs.\n\nThe physical parameters of the stick figure are as follows:\n*   **Head**: A uniform sphere of mass `m` and radius `r`. The mass is given by the relation `m = 0.6\\lambda l`. We assume its radius `r` is negligible and its center of mass is located at the upper hinge, `H_A`.\n*   **Torso**: A uniform rod of length `l` and mass per unit length `\\lambda`. Its mass is `m_T = \\lambda l`.\n*   **Arms**: Two identical uniform rods, each of length `l` and mass `m_A = \\lambda l`.\n*   **Legs**: Two identical uniform rods, each of length `1.2l` and mass `m_L = 1.2\\lambda l`.\n\nThe configuration and motion are described by two angles:\n*   `\\theta(t)`: The angle between each arm and the vertical torso. The arms are actively driven to oscillate around the horizontal position (`\\theta = \\pi/2`) with a small amplitude `\\theta_0` and angular frequency `\\omega`. The motion is described by `\\theta(t) = \\pi/2 + \\theta_0 \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n*   `\\varphi(t)`: The angle between each leg and the downward vertical extension of the torso. The legs oscillate passively around the equilibrium angle `\\varphi_{eq} = \\pi/4`. We describe this small oscillation by `\\delta(t)`, such that `\\varphi(t) = \\pi/4 + \\delta(t)`.\n\nThe entire stick figure is in free-fall in a uniform gravitational field with acceleration `g`. Due to the symmetric construction and motion of the arms and legs, the torso only undergoes vertical translation. We establish an inertial frame of reference with the y-axis pointing upwards. Let `y(t)` be the vertical coordinate of the lower hinge `H_L` (connecting torso and legs). The problem states that the couple exerted by the torso on the legs is zero, as the legs are passive. We aim to find the amplitude `A` of the steady-state leg oscillation `\\delta(t)`.\n\n### Step 1: System Masses and Center of Mass Kinematics\nFirst, we define the masses of the components and the vertical positions of their centers of mass (CM) in terms of the generalized coordinates `y(t)`, `\\varphi(t)`, and `\\theta(t)`.\n\nThe masses of the components are:\n*   Torso: `m_T = \\lambda l`\n*   Each Arm: `m_A = \\lambda l`\n*   Each Leg: `m_L = 1.2\\lambda l`\n*   Head: `m_{head} = m = 0.6\\lambda l`\n\nThe total mass of the system is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nM_{\\text{tot}} = m_{head} + m_T + 2m_A + 2m_L = (0.6 + 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 1.2)\\lambda l = 6\\lambda l\n\\label{eq:total_mass} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLet the lower hinge `H_L` be at `\\mathbf{r}_{H_L} = (0, y)`. The upper hinge `H_A` is at `\\mathbf{r}_{H_A} = (0, y+l)`. The vertical positions of the CMs of the various parts are:\n*   **Legs**: The CM of each leg is at a distance of `1.2l/2 = 0.6l` from `H_L`. Its vertical position is `y_{CM,L} = y - 0.6l \\cos\\varphi`.\n*   **Arms**: The CM of each arm is at a distance of `l/2 = 0.5l` from `H_A`.

The combined mass is `M_{TH} = m_T + m_{head} = 1.6\\lambda l`. The vertical position of their combined CM is:\n    `y_{CM,TH} = \\frac{m_T(y+l/2) + m_{head}(y+l)}{M_{TH}} = y + \\frac{\\lambda l(l/2) + 0.6\\lambda l(l)}{1.6\\lambda l} = y + \\frac{1.1}{1.6}l`.\n\nThe vertical position of the total center of mass of the stick figure, `Y_{CM,tot}`, is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nM_{\\text{tot}} Y_{CM,tot} &= M_{TH} y_{CM,TH} + 2m_A y_{CM,A} + 2m_L y_{CM,L} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (1.6\\lambda l)(y + \\frac{1.1}{1.6}l) + 2(\\lambda l)(y + l - 0.5l \\cos\\theta) + 2(1.2\\lambda l)(y - 0.6l \\cos\\varphi) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (1.6+2+2.4)\\lambda l y + (1.1 + 2 - 1\\cos\\theta - 1.44\\cos\\varphi)\\lambda l^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= M_{\\text{tot}} y + (3.1 - \\cos\\theta - 1.44\\cos\\varphi)\\lambda l^2\n\\label{eq:Y_cm} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Global Equation of Motion and Hinge Acceleration\nSince the entire stick figure is in free-fall, its total center of mass must accelerate downwards with acceleration `g`.

The position of the leg's CM relative to `H_L` is `\\mathbf{r}_{H_L,CM} = (0.6l\\sin\\varphi, -0.6l\\cos\\varphi, 0)`.

We seek the steady-state solution, which oscillates at the driving frequency `\\omega`.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nWe assume a steady-state solution of the form:\n\\[\\boxed{\\delta(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t)}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe second time derivative of the assumed solution is `\\ddot{\\delta}(t) = -A \\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t)`. Substituting this into the linearized equation \\eqref{eq:linear_eom_final}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n0.4896(-A \\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t)) &= - \\frac{0.12}{\\sqrt{2}} \\omega^2\\theta_0\\cos(\\omega t) \\nonumber \\\\\n0.4896 A &= \\frac{0.12}{\\sqrt{2}}\\theta_0 \\nonumber \\\\\nA &= \\frac{0.12}{0.4896\\sqrt{2}} \\theta_0\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo simplify the fraction, we can use `0.12/0.4896 = 1200/4896 = 25/102`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nA &= \\frac{25}{102\\sqrt{2}} \\theta_0 \\nonumber \\\\\nA &= \\frac{25\\sqrt{2}}{102 \\cdot 2} \\theta_0 = \\frac{25\\sqrt{2}}{204} \\theta_0\n\\label{eq:final_amplitude} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe amplitude `A` is dimensionless and proportional to the driving amplitude `\\theta_0`. Notably, the result is independent of the mass parameter `\\lambda`, length `l`, gravitational acceleration `g`, and the driving frequency `\\omega`. This occurs because the driving term, which originates from the arm's motion, and the leg's inertial response are both proportional to `\\omega^2`, causing the frequency to cancel out. The term \"resonance\" in the problem statement refers to this steady-state driven response, not a frequency-dependent peak in amplitude.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe amplitude of resonance for the legs is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{A = \\frac{25\\sqrt{2}}{204}\\theta_{0}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

Let $n_x$ be the initial moles of fuel and $n_0$ be the initial moles of air.\n    *   The total initial moles of gas are $n_{tot,0} = n_x + n_0$.\n    *   The molar proportion of fuel is given as $\\alpha = \\frac{n_x}{n_{tot,0}}$.\n*   **Final State (State 1):**\n    *   Pressure: $P_1$ (to be determined)\n    *   Temperature: $T_1$\n    *   The gas is a mixture of reaction products ($H_2O, CO_2$) and unreacted components of air ($N_2$ and excess $O_2$).\n    *   Total final moles of gas: $n_{tot,1}$.\n\n**Process and Key Information:**\n*   **Chemical Reaction:** The combustion of ethanol in air is given by the equation:\n    $C_{2}H_{5}OH(g) + 3O_{2}(g) \\rightarrow 3H_{2}O(g) + 2CO_{2}(g)$.\n*   **Thermodynamic Process:** The reaction occurs in a sealed, insulated bottle. This means the process is adiabatic (no heat exchange with the surroundings, $Q=0$) and isochoric (constant volume, so work done is $W=0$).\n*   **Reaction Enthalpy:** The molar enthalpy of reaction at constant pressure $P_0$ and temperature $T_0$ is given as $\\Delta_r H_m = -\\lambda$. For the reaction of $n_x$ moles of fuel, the total enthalpy change under these conditions is $\\Delta H = -n_x \\lambda$.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1.  All gases (reactants and products) behave as ideal gases.\n2.  Air consists only of diatomic nitrogen ($N_2$) and oxygen ($O_2$).\n3.  The reaction is complete, with ethanol being the limiting reactant, meaning there is excess air (specifically, excess oxygen).\n4.  Vibrational degrees of freedom of all gas molecules are not excited. This determines their molar heat capacities at constant volume ($C_{V,m}$):\n    *   Diatomic gases ($N_2, O_2$) and linear polyatomic gases ($CO_2$): Have 3 translational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom, so $f=5$. $C_{V,m} = \\frac{5}{2}R$.\n    *   Non-linear polyatomic gases ($C_2H_5OH, H_2O$): Have 3 translational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom, so $f=6$. $C_{V,m} = 3R$.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Initial Moles of Fuel and Air\nFirst, we use the definition of the molar proportion $\\alpha$ to establish a relationship between the initial moles of fuel, $n_x$, and air, $n_0$.\n\\[\n\\boxed{ \\alpha = \\frac{n_x}{n_{tot,0}} = \\frac{n_x}{n_x + n_0} }\n\\]\nFrom this definition, we can express $n_x$ in terms of $n_0$ and $\\alpha$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\alpha (n_x + n_0) &= n_x \\nonumber \\\\\n\\alpha n_0 &= n_x - \\alpha n_x \\nonumber \\\\\n\\alpha n_0 &= n_x(1-\\alpha) \\nonumber \\\\\nn_x &= \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} n_0\n\\label{eq:nx_vs_n0} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis relationship will be used to express results in terms of the given proportion $\\alpha$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Final Molar Composition\nNext, we determine the total number of moles of gas, $n_{tot,1}$, after the combustion is complete, using the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\\[\n\\boxed{ C_{2}H_{5}OH(g) + 3O_{2}(g) \\rightarrow 3H_{2}O(g) + 2CO_{2}(g) }\n\\]\nThe reaction consumes $n_x$ moles of ethanol and $3n_x$ moles of oxygen, while producing $3n_x$ moles of water vapor and $2n_x$ moles of carbon dioxide. The change in the total number of moles of gas, $\\Delta n_{tot}$, is the moles of gaseous products formed minus the moles of gaseous reactants consumed.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta n_{tot} &= n_{products} - n_{reactants\\_consumed} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (n_{H_2O} + n_{CO_2}) - (n_{C_2H_5OH} + n_{O_2}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (3n_x + 2n_x) - (n_x + 3n_x) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 5n_x - 4n_x = n_x\n\\label{eq:delta_n_tot} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe total number of moles of gas increases by $n_x$. The final total moles, $n_{tot,1}$, can be found by adding this change to the initial total moles, $n_{tot,0}$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn_{tot,1} &= n_{tot,0} + \\Delta n_{tot} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (n_0 + n_x) + n_x \\nonumber \\\\\n&= n_0 + 2n_x\n\\label{eq:n_final} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Apply the First Law of Thermodynamics\nThe process occurs in a sealed, insulated container, meaning it is adiabatic ($Q=0$) and isochoric ($W=0$). The First Law of Thermodynamics dictates the change in the system's internal energy, $\\Delta U$.\n\\[\n\\boxed{ \\Delta U = Q - W }\n\\]\nFor this specific process, the total change in internal energy is zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta U = 0 - 0 = 0\n\\label{eq:deltaU_zero} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo analyze this, we can conceptualize the overall process as a two-step thermodynamic path from the initial state (reactants at $T_0$) to the final state (products at $T_1$):\n1.  An isothermal, isochoric chemical reaction at the initial temperature $T_0$. The change in internal energy for this step is $\\Delta U_{reaction, T_0}$.\n2.  An isochoric heating of the product mixture from $T_0$ to the final temperature $T_1$. The change in internal energy for this step is $\\Delta U_{heating}$.\nThe total change in internal energy is the sum of these two conceptual steps:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta U = \\Delta U_{reaction, T_0} + \\Delta U_{heating} = 0\n\\label{eq:U_decomp} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Chemical Internal Energy Change ($\\Delta U_{reaction, T_0}$)\nWe calculate the internal energy change for the isothermal reaction at $T_0$ using the given reaction enthalpy.\n\\[\n\\boxed{ \\Delta H = \\Delta U + \\Delta(PV) }\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{ PV = nRT \\quad (\\text{Ideal Gas Law}) }\n\\]\nThe given reaction enthalpy for $n_x$ moles of fuel is $\\Delta H = -n_x \\lambda$. For a reaction of ideal gases at a constant temperature $T_0$, the change in the $PV$ term is $\\Delta(PV) = \\Delta(n_{gas}RT_0) = (\\Delta n_{gas})RT_0$, where $\\Delta n_{gas}$ is the change in the number of moles of gas for the stoichiometric reaction.

A fox moves along a straight line, which we denote as $AB$, at a constant speed $v_{1}$. A hound pursues the fox, moving at a constant speed $v_{2}$. The defining characteristic of the pursuit is that the hound's velocity vector is always directed towards the fox's instantaneous position.\n\nWe are asked to find the magnitude of the hound's acceleration at a specific moment. At this instant, the physical configuration is as follows:\n1.  The fox is at a point $F$.\n2.  The hound is at a point $D$.\n3.  The line segment connecting the hound and the fox, $FD$, is perpendicular to the fox's path $AB$.\n4.  The length of the segment $FD$ is given as $L$.\n\nTo analyze the motion, we establish a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. For simplicity, let the fox's path $AB$ be the horizontal line $y=L$. At the moment of interest, which we set as time $t=0$, the segment $FD$ is perpendicular to the line $y=L$. This means $F$ and $D$ must have the same x-coordinate. We can set this x-coordinate to zero without loss of generality due to translational symmetry.\n*   The position of the fox at $t=0$ is $\\vec{r}_F(0) = (0, L)$.\n*   The position of the hound at $t=0$ is $\\vec{r}_D(0) = (0, 0)$.\nThis setup satisfies the given conditions: the path $AB$ is the line $y=L$, the segment $FD$ lies along the y-axis (and is thus perpendicular to $AB$), and the distance is $FD = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (L-0)^2} = L$.\n\nThe velocities of the fox and the hound at this instant ($t=0$) are:\n*   **Fox's velocity, $\\vec{v}_F$**: The fox moves along the line $y=L$ at a constant speed $v_1$. We can assume it moves in the positive x-direction, so its velocity vector is $\\vec{v}_F = (v_1, 0)$.\n*   **Hound's velocity, $\\vec{v}_H$**: The hound, located at the origin $(0,0)$, is always aimed at the fox, which is at $(0, L)$. Therefore, the hound's velocity vector points in the positive y-direction. Since its speed is $v_2$, its velocity vector is $\\vec{v}_H = (0, v_2)$.\n\nThe objective is to find the magnitude of the hound's acceleration, $|\\vec{a}_H|$, at this specific moment ($t=0$).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Nature of the Hound's Acceleration\nThe acceleration vector of any particle, $\\vec{a}$, can be decomposed into two orthogonal components: a tangential component $\\vec{a}_t$, which is parallel to the velocity and describes the change in speed, and a normal component $\\vec{a}_n$, which is perpendicular to the velocity and describes the change in direction.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{a} = \\vec{a}_t + \\vec{a}_n}\\]\nThe magnitude of the tangential component of acceleration, $a_t$, is defined as the rate of change of the particle's speed, $v=|\\vec{v}|$.\n\\[\\boxed{a_t = \\frac{d|\\vec{v}|}{dt}}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{In this problem, the hound moves at a constant speed } v_2. \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{Therefore, the magnitude of its velocity is constant: } |\\vec{v}_H| = v_2 = \\text{constant}. \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{This means the tangential component of its acceleration is zero.} \\nonumber \\\\\na_t = \\frac{dv_2}{dt} = 0 \\label{eq:at_zero} \\tag{1} \\\\\n\\text{Consequently, the hound's acceleration is purely normal to its path of motion.} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\vec{a}_H = \\vec{a}_n \\label{eq:a_is_an} \\tag{2} \\\\\n\\text{The magnitude of the total acceleration is thus equal to the magnitude of the normal acceleration, } a_H = a_n. \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{This normal acceleration arises solely from the change in the direction of the hound's velocity vector.} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Relate Acceleration to the Rotation of the Velocity Vector\nSince the hound's acceleration is due to the change in its velocity's direction, we can express it in terms of the rotation of its velocity vector. The hound's velocity vector is always aligned with the unit vector pointing from the hound to the fox.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{v} = v \\vec{u}}\\]\nHere, $\\vec{u}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the velocity $\\vec{v}$, and $v$ is the speed. The time derivative of a unit vector $\\vec{u}$ that is rotating with an angular velocity $\\vec{\\omega}$ is given by the kinematic relation:\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d\\vec{u}}{dt} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{u}}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{The hound's acceleration } \\vec{a}_H \\text{ is the time derivative of its velocity } \\vec{v}_H. \\nonumber \\\\\n\\vec{a}_H &= \\frac{d\\vec{v}_H}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(v_2 \\vec{u}) \\label{eq:a_def} \\tag{3} \\\\\n\\text{where } \\vec{u} \\text{ is the unit vector pointing from the hound to the fox. Since } v_2 \\text{ is constant:} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\vec{a}_H &= v_2 \\frac{d\\vec{u}}{dt} \\label{eq:a_deriv} \\tag{4} \\\\\n\\text{Substituting the expression for the derivative of a rotating unit vector:} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\vec{a}_H &= v_2 (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{u}) \\label{eq:a_omega} \\tag{5} \\\\\n\\text{Here, } \\vec{\\omega} \\text{ is the angular velocity of the line of sight from the hound to the fox.} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{The magnitude of the acceleration is } a_H = |\\vec{a}_H| = v_2 |\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{u}|. \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{The angular velocity vector } \\vec{\\omega} \\text{ is perpendicular to the plane of motion (the xy-plane), while } \\vec{u} \\text{ lies within this plane.} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{Thus, } \\vec{\\omega} \\text{ is perpendicular to } \\vec{u}, \\text{ and the magnitude of their cross product is:} \\nonumber \\\\\n|\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{u}| &= |\\vec{\\omega}||\\vec{u}|\\sin(90^\\circ) = \\omega \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\omega. \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{Therefore, the magnitude of the hound's acceleration is:} \\nonumber \\\\\na_H &= v_2 \\omega \\label{eq:a_mag} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Angular Velocity of the Line of Sight\nThe angular velocity of the line connecting the hound and the fox is determined by their relative motion.\nThe relative velocity of the fox with respect to the hound is given by the principle of Galilean relativity:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{v}_{\\text{rel}} = \\vec{v}_F - \\vec{v}_H}\\]\nThe magnitude of the angular velocity, $\\omega$, of the separation vector $\\vec{r}$ is the magnitude of the component of the relative velocity perpendicular to $\\vec{r}$, denoted $v_{\\text{rel,}\\perp}$, divided by the distance $r=|\\vec{r}|$.\n\\[\\boxed{\\omega = \\frac{v_{\\text{rel,}\\perp}}{r}}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{At the instant } t=0, \\text{ using the coordinate system from the problem explanation:} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{The separation vector from the hound to the fox is } \\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_F - \\vec{r}_H = (0, L) - (0, 0) = (0, L). \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{The distance between them is } r = |\\vec{r}| = L. \\label{eq:dist} \\tag{7} \\\\\n\\text{The velocities are } \\vec{v}_F = (v_1, 0) \\text{ and } \\vec{v}_H = (0, v_2). \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{The relative velocity is:} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\vec{v}_{\\text{rel}} &= \\vec{v}_F - \\vec{v}_H = (v_1, 0) - (0, v_2) = (v_1, -v_2). \\label{eq:v_rel} \\tag{8} \\\\\n\\text{The line of sight vector } \\vec{r} \\text{ is along the y-axis. The component of the relative velocity } \\vec{v}_{\\text{rel}} \\text{ that is perpendicular to the line of sight is its x-component.} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{The magnitude of this perpendicular component is } v_{\\text{rel,}\\perp} = |(\\vec{v}_{\\text{rel}})_x| = |v_1| = v_1 \\text{ (since } v_1 \\text{ is a speed).} \\label{eq:v_perp} \\tag{9} \\\\\n\\text{Now, we can calculate the magnitude of the angular velocity } \\omega: \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega &= \\frac{v_{\\text{rel,}\\perp}}{r} = \\frac{v_1}{L}. \\label{eq:omega_val} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Hound's Acceleration\nWe now combine the results from the previous steps to find the magnitude of the hound's acceleration. This step is a direct substitution of the angular velocity found in Step 3 into the expression for acceleration derived in Step 2. No new principles are required.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{From Eq. \\eqref{eq:a_mag} in Step 2, the magnitude of the hound's acceleration is related to the angular velocity by:} \\nonumber \\\\\na_H &= v_2 \\omega \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{From Eq. \\eqref{eq:omega_val} in Step 3, we found the angular velocity of the line of sight at the given instant:} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega &= \\frac{v_1}{L} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{Substituting the expression for } \\omega \\text{ into the equation for } a_H: \\nonumber \\\\\na_H &= v_2 \\left(\\frac{v_1}{L}\\right) = \\frac{v_1 v_2}{L}. \\label{eq:final_a} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis is the magnitude of the hound's acceleration at the specific moment when the line connecting the hound and the fox is perpendicular to the fox's path.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe magnitude of the hound's acceleration at the given moment is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{a_H = \\frac{v_1 v_2}{L}}\n\\end{align}\\]"}

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "tag": "ELECTRICITY", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field.

This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere.

Surfaces of constant $\\mu$ are confocal oblate spheroids, and surfaces of constant $\\nu$ are confocal hyperboloids of one sheet.\n\nThe electric field $\\vec{E}$ has the following properties:\n1.  **Tubular Field Structure**: The field lines are parallel to the coordinate curves of $\\mu$. This implies the electric field vector has only a $\\mu$-component, so $\\vec{E} = E_\\mu \\hat{\\mu}$.\n2.  **Rotational Symmetry**: The field is symmetric with respect to rotations around the $z$-axis.

This means the $z$-component of the electric field, $E_z$, must be positive for all points where $z>0$.\n4.  **Source Location**: The charges generating the field are confined to the $xy$-plane. Consequently, for any region with $z \\neq 0$, there are no charges.\n5.  **Boundary Condition**: Near the origin $(x,y,z)=(0,0,0)$, the magnitude of the electric field approaches a constant value $E_0$.\n\nThe $xy$-plane ($z=0$) corresponds to two distinct surfaces in oblate spheroidal coordinates:\n*   $z=0 \\implies a\\sinh\\mu\\sin\\nu = 0 \\implies \\mu=0$ or $\\nu=0$.\n*   For $\\mu=0$: The radial distance from the $z$-axis is $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = a\\cos\\nu$.

This is given by $E_z = \\vec{E} \\cdot \\hat{k} = E_\\mu (\\hat{\\mu} \\cdot \\hat{k}) = E_\\mu (\\hat{\\mu})_z$. The $z$-component of the unit vector $\\hat{\\mu}$ is found using the scale factor.\n\\[\\boxed{(\\hat{\\mu})_z = \\frac{1}{h_\\mu}\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\mu}}\\]\nUsing $z = a \\sinh\\mu \\sin\\nu$, we have $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\mu} = a \\cosh\\mu \\sin\\nu$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\hat{\\mu})_z = \\frac{a \\cosh\\mu \\sin\\nu}{a\\sqrt{\\sinh^2\\mu + \\sin^2\\nu}} = \\frac{\\cosh\\mu \\sin\\nu}{\\sqrt{\\sinh^2\\mu + \\sin^2\\nu}} \\label{eq:mu_hat_z_derived} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe $z$-component of the electric field is $E_z = E_\\mu (\\hat{\\mu})_z$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_z(\\mu, \\nu) = \\left( \\frac{E_0}{\\cosh\\mu \\sqrt{\\sinh^2\\mu + \\sin^2\\nu}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\cosh\\mu \\sin\\nu}{\\sqrt{\\sinh^2\\mu + \\sin^2\\nu}} \\right) = \\frac{E_0 \\sin\\nu}{\\sinh^2\\mu + \\sin^2\\nu} \\label{eq:Ez_derived} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor $z>0$, we have $\\sin\\nu>0$. Assuming $E_0>0$, $E_z$ is positive, satisfying the \"upwards\" field condition. We now evaluate $E_z$ on either side of the $z=0$ plane.\nFor the region outside the disk ($r>a$), we have $\\nu=0$. From Eq. \\eqref{eq:Ez_derived}, $E_z=0$.\nFor the disk ($r<a$), we have $\\mu=0$. The region just above the disk ($z \\to 0^+$) corresponds to $\\mu \\to 0$ and $\\sin\\nu > 0$ (i.e., $0 < \\nu \\le \\pi/2$). The region just below ($z \\to 0^-$) corresponds to $\\mu \\to 0$ and $\\sin\\nu < 0$ (i.e., $-\\pi/2 \\le \\nu < 0$).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{z, \\text{above}}(\\mu=0, \\nu>0) &= \\frac{E_0 \\sin\\nu}{0 + \\sin^2\\nu} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sin\\nu} \\label{eq:Ez_above_nu_derived} \\tag{13} \\\\\nE_{z, \\text{below}}(\\mu=0, \\nu<0) &= \\frac{E_0 \\sin\\nu}{0 + \\sin^2\\nu} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sin\\nu} \\label{eq:Ez_below_nu_derived} \\tag{14}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nOn the disk ($\\mu=0$), the radial distance is $r = a \\cos\\nu$.

We are given two key pieces of information:\n1.  The x-component of the particle's velocity, $v_x$, is constant.\n2.  At a specific moment in time, the radius of curvature of the particle's path is $R$.\n\nOur objective is to find the magnitude of the particle's total acceleration, $a$, at this moment.\n\nLet's define the variables we will use:\n*   $\\vec{v}(t) = v_x \\hat{i} + v_y(t) \\hat{j}$: The velocity vector of the particle.\n*   $v(t) = |\\vec{v}(t)| = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y(t)^2}$: The speed of the particle.\n*   $\\vec{a}(t) = a_x \\hat{i} + a_y(t) \\hat{j}$: The acceleration vector of the particle.\n*   $a(t) = |\\vec{a}(t)|$: The magnitude of the acceleration.\n*   $R$: The instantaneous radius of curvature of the path.\n*   $\\theta(t)$: The angle the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ makes with the positive x-axis. Thus, $v_x = v \\cos\\theta$ and $v_y = v \\sin\\theta$.\n*   $a_\\tau(t)$: The tangential component of acceleration, which describes the rate of change of speed.\n*   $a_n(t)$: The normal component of acceleration, which describes the change in direction of velocity.\n\nThe condition that $v_x$ is constant implies that the x-component of acceleration, $a_x$, is zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na_x = \\frac{d v_x}{d t} = 0\n\\label{eq:ax_zero} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis means the acceleration vector is always directed along the y-axis: $\\vec{a} = a_y \\hat{j}$.\nWe will assume that the path is genuinely curved, so the radius of curvature $R$ is finite and non-zero. For a curved path with a constant $v_x$, we must have $v_x \\neq 0$. If $v_x=0$, the motion would be a straight line along the y-axis, for which $R \\to \\infty$ (unless the particle is at rest), contradicting the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Decompose Acceleration into Tangential and Normal Components\nIn kinematics, it is often useful to analyze acceleration in a natural coordinate system that moves with the particle, with axes tangential and normal to the path. The acceleration vector $\\vec{a}$ can be decomposed into a tangential component $\\vec{a}_\\tau$ and a normal component $\\vec{a}_n$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{a} = \\vec{a}_{\\tau} + \\vec{a}_{n}}\\]\nThe magnitudes of these components are given by standard kinematic formulas. The tangential acceleration is the rate of change of speed, and the normal acceleration is related to the speed and the radius of curvature.\n\\[\\boxed{a_{\\tau} = \\frac{dv}{dt}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{a_{n} = \\frac{v^2}{R}}\\]\nSince the tangential and normal components are orthogonal, the magnitude of the total acceleration is given by the Pythagorean theorem.\n\\[\\boxed{a = \\sqrt{a_{\\tau}^2 + a_{n}^2}}\\]\nWe will use this relation to find the total acceleration.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na = \\sqrt{a_{\\tau}^2 + a_{n}^2}\n\\label{eq:a_mag} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Find a Relation for the Tangential Acceleration\nWe can find an expression for the tangential acceleration, $a_\\tau$, by using the given condition that $v_x$ is constant. We relate $v_x$ to the speed $v$ and the angle $\\theta$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{v_x = v \\cos\\theta}\\]\nThe problem states that $v_x$ is constant, so its time derivative is zero.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d v_x}{d t} = 0}\\]\nWe differentiate the expression for $v_x$ with respect to time using the product rule for derivatives.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d v_x}{d t} &= \\frac{d}{dt}(v \\cos\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n0 &= \\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right) \\cos\\theta + v \\left(-\\sin\\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right) \\label{eq:dvx_dt} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nRecognizing that $a_\\tau = dv/dt$, we can rearrange Eq. \\eqref{eq:dvx_dt} to solve for $a_\\tau$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na_\\tau \\cos\\theta &= v \\sin\\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\nonumber \\\\\na_\\tau &= v \\tan\\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\quad (\\text{for } \\cos\\theta \\neq 0)\n\\label{eq:atau_expr} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs established in the problem explanation, $\\cos\\theta \\neq 0$ because we assume $v_x \\neq 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Rate of Change of Angle to Kinematic Variables\nThe term $d\\theta/dt$ represents the rate of change of the direction of the velocity vector. We can relate it to the speed $v$ and the radius of curvature $R$ using the definitions of these quantities in terms of the arc length $s$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{v = \\frac{ds}{dt}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{R = \\left| \\frac{ds}{d\\theta} \\right|}\\]\nWe use the chain rule to relate the derivatives with respect to time $t$ and arc length $s$.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{d\\theta}{ds} \\frac{ds}{dt}}\\]\nBy applying the chain rule and taking the absolute value, we find the magnitude of $d\\theta/dt$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left|\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{d\\theta}{ds}\\right| \\left|\\frac{ds}{dt}\\right|\n\\label{eq:chain_rule_app} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the definitions of $v$ and $R$ into Eq. \\eqref{eq:chain_rule_app}, we obtain:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left|\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right| = \\frac{1}{R} v = \\frac{v}{R}\n\\label{eq:thetadot_mag} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine Results to Find the Total Acceleration\nNow we have all the pieces to calculate the magnitude of the total acceleration, $a$. First, we find the magnitude of the tangential acceleration, $|a_\\tau|$, by taking the absolute value of Eq. \\eqref{eq:atau_expr} and using the result from Eq. \\eqref{eq:thetadot_mag}.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|a_\\tau| = \\left|v \\tan\\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right| = v |\\tan\\theta| \\left|\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right| = v |\\tan\\theta| \\left(\\frac{v}{R}\\right) = \\frac{v^2}{R} |\\tan\\theta|\n\\label{eq:atau_mag} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we use the formula for the total acceleration magnitude from Step 1. We will also need the Pythagorean trigonometric identity.\n\\[\\boxed{a = \\sqrt{a_{\\tau}^2 + a_{n}^2}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{a_n = \\frac{v^2}{R}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{1 + \\tan^2\\theta = \\sec^2\\theta}\\]\nSubstituting the expressions for $|a_\\tau|$ and $a_n$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na &= \\sqrt{|a_\\tau|^2 + a_n^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{v^2}{R} |\\tan\\theta|\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{v^2}{R}\\right)^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{v^2}{R}\\right)^2 (\\tan^2\\theta + 1)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{v^2}{R} \\sqrt{\\sec^2\\theta} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{v^2}{R} |\\sec\\theta| = \\frac{v^2}{R |\\cos\\theta|}\n\\label{eq:a_interim} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Express the Acceleration in Terms of Speed and Velocity Component\nThe expression for acceleration in Eq. \\eqref{eq:a_interim} depends on the angle $\\theta$, which is an intermediate variable. We can eliminate $\\theta$ by using the relationship between $v_x$, $v$, and $\\theta$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{v_x = v \\cos\\theta}\\]\nFrom this relation, we can write $|\\cos\\theta| = \\frac{|v_x|}{v}$, since speed $v=|\\vec{v}|$ is non-negative.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|\\cos\\theta| = \\frac{|v_x|}{v}\n\\label{eq:cos_theta} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting Eq. \\eqref{eq:cos_theta} into our expression for acceleration, Eq. \\eqref{eq:a_interim}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na &= \\frac{v^2}{R |\\cos\\theta|} = \\frac{v^2}{R \\left(\\frac{|v_x|}{v}\\right)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{v^3}{R |v_x|}\n\\label{eq:a_final} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis final expression gives the magnitude of the acceleration in terms of the particle's speed $v$, the radius of curvature $R$, and the constant x-component of velocity $v_x$, all evaluated at the specific moment. The problem statement does not provide the speed $v$, so the answer must be expressed in terms of it.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe magnitude of the acceleration at this moment is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{a = \\frac{v^3}{R |v_x|}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

These atoms have two energy levels: a ground state $A_0$ with rest mass $m_0$, and an excited state $A^*$ with a higher energy.\n*   **Reference Frames:** The laboratory frame is denoted by $S$. The rest frame of the atoms is denoted by $S'$. The frame $S'$ moves with a velocity $\\mathbf{v} = v\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ relative to frame $S$.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy difference between the excited and ground states is $E_0$. An atom in the excited state can transition to the ground state by emitting a single photon. In the atom's rest frame $S'$, the energy of this photon is $E_0$.\n*   **Decay Process:** In the atom's rest reference frame, $S'$, the probability per unit time for an excited atom to decay is a constant, $\\lambda$. The emission of photons is isotropic (equally probable in all directions) in this frame.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** At the initial time $t=0$ in the lab frame $S$, all $N_0$ atoms are in the excited state $A^*$. The clocks in frame $S$ and the atoms' rest frame $S'$ are synchronized such that $t=t'=0$.\n*   **Goal:** We need to find $w(\\theta, t)$, which is the power emitted per unit solid angle in a direction specified by the angle $\\theta$ with respect to the direction of motion (the $+\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ axis), at a time $t$ as measured in the lab frame $S$.\n\n**Variables and Constants:**\n*   $N_0$: Initial total number of atoms.\n*   $E_0$: Energy difference between the excited and ground states (photon energy in the rest frame).\n*   $\\lambda$: Transition probability per unit time in the atom's rest frame $S'$.\n*   $\\mathbf{v}$: Velocity of the atoms in the lab frame $S$, with magnitude $v$.\n*   $c$: Speed of light in vacuum.\n*   $t$: Time measured in the lab frame $S$.\n*   $t'$: Time measured in the atom's rest frame $S'$ (proper time).\n*   $\\theta$: Angle of photon emission relative to the $+\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ axis in frame $S$.\n*   $\\theta'$: Angle of photon emission relative to the $+\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}'$ axis in frame $S'$.\n*   $\\beta = v/c$: The speed of the atoms as a fraction of the speed of light.\n*   $\\gamma = (1 - \\beta^2)^{-1/2}$: The Lorentz factor.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1.  $N_0 \\gg 1$: The large number of atoms allows us to treat the decay process using a continuous differential equation.\n2.  $m_0c^2 \\gg E_0$: The rest energy of an atom is much larger than the transition energy. This justifies ignoring the recoil of the atom upon photon emission, so the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ of the atom remains constant throughout the process.\n\n### Step 1: Decay Law and Photon Emission Rate in the Atom's Rest Frame (S')\nIn the rest frame of the atoms, $S'$, the decay process is described by the law of radioactive decay. We first determine the number of excited atoms as a function of time $t'$ and the rate of photon emission per unit solid angle.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe number of atoms $dN'$ that decay in an infinitesimal time interval $dt'$ is proportional to the number of excited atoms $N'(t')$ present and the length of the time interval. This is the law of radioactive decay.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{dN'(t')}{dt'} = -\\lambda N'(t')}\\]\nThe emission of photons is isotropic in the rest frame $S'$. This means the number of photons emitted per unit time per unit solid angle is uniform over the total solid angle of $4\\pi$ steradians.\n\n**Derivation:**\nWe solve the differential decay equation with the initial condition that at $t'=0$, the number of excited atoms is $N'(0) = N_0$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\int_{N_0}^{N'(t')} \\frac{dN'}{N'} &= \\int_0^{t'} -\\lambda dt' \\nonumber \\\\\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N'(t')}{N_0}\\right) &= -\\lambda t' \\nonumber \\\\\nN'(t') &= N_0 e^{-\\lambda t'} \\label{eq:N_prime} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe total rate of decay, which is equal to the total number of photons emitted per unit time in $S'$, is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n-\\frac{dN'(t')}{dt'} = \\lambda N'(t') = \\lambda N_0 e^{-\\lambda t'} \\label{eq:decay_rate} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nDue to the isotropic emission assumption, the number of photons emitted per unit time per unit solid angle in $S'$ is this total rate divided by $4\\pi$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d^2 N_{ph}}{dt' d\\Omega'} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left(-\\frac{dN'}{dt'}\\right) = \\frac{\\lambda N_0}{4\\pi} e^{-\\lambda t'} \\label{eq:photon_flux_prime} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Transformation of the Photon Emission Rate to the Lab Frame (S)\nTo find the power in the lab frame $S$, we first need to find the photon emission rate per unit solid angle in $S$, denoted $\\frac{d^2 N_{ph}}{dt d\\Omega}$. This requires transforming the time interval $dt'$ and the solid angle element $d\\Omega'$ from frame $S'$ to frame $S$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe number of photons $d^2N_{ph}$ emitted into a corresponding solid angle element during a corresponding time interval is a Lorentz invariant quantity.\n\\[\\boxed{d^2 N_{ph} \\text{ is invariant}}\\]\nThe relationship between a time interval in the lab frame, $dt$, and the corresponding proper time interval in the moving frame, $dt'$, is given by time dilation.\n\\[\\boxed{dt = \\gamma dt'}\\]\nThe relationship between the emission angles in the two frames is given by the relativistic aberration of light formula.\n\\[\\boxed{\\cos\\theta' = \\frac{\\cos\\theta - \\beta}{1 - \\beta\\cos\\theta}}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe invariance of $d^2N_{ph}$ implies $d^2N_{ph} = \\left(\\frac{d^2 N_{ph}}{dt d\\Omega}\\right) dt d\\Omega = \\left(\\frac{d^2 N_{ph}}{dt' d\\Omega'}\\right) dt' d\\Omega'$. Rearranging gives the transformation for the rate:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d^2 N_{ph}}{dt d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{d^2 N_{ph}}{dt' d\\Omega'}\\right) \\frac{dt'}{dt} \\frac{d\\Omega'}{d\\Omega} \\label{eq:flux_transform} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFrom time dilation, we have $\\frac{dt'}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} = \\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$. For the solid angle transformation, we have $d\\Omega = 2\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta = -2\\pi d(\\cos\\theta)$ and $d\\Omega' = -2\\pi d(\\cos\\theta')$. Thus, the ratio of solid angles is $\\frac{d\\Omega'}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{d(\\cos\\theta')}{d(\\cos\\theta)}$. Differentiating the aberration formula with respect to $\\cos\\theta$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d\\Omega'}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{d(\\cos\\theta')}{d(\\cos\\theta)} &= \\frac{d}{d(\\cos\\theta)}\\left(\\frac{\\cos\\theta - \\beta}{1 - \\beta\\cos\\theta}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1 \\cdot (1 - \\beta\\cos\\theta) - (\\cos\\theta - \\beta)(-\\beta)}{(1 - \\beta\\cos\\theta)^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1 - \\beta\\cos\\theta + \\beta\\cos\\theta - \\beta^2}{(1 - \\beta\\cos\\theta)^2} = \\frac{1-\\beta^2}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)^2} \\label{eq:solid_angle_transform} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow, substitute the results from Eq. \\eqref{eq:photon_flux_prime}, time dilation, and Eq. \\eqref{eq:solid_angle_transform} into Eq. \\eqref{eq:flux_transform}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d^2 N_{ph}}{dt d\\Omega} &= \\left(\\frac{\\lambda N_0}{4\\pi} e^{-\\lambda t'}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1-\\beta^2}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)^2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\lambda N_0}{4\\pi} e^{-\\lambda t'} \\left(\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1-\\beta^2}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)^2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\lambda N_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{(1-\\beta^2)^{3/2}}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)^2} e^{-\\lambda t'} \\label{eq:photon_flux_S} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Angular Power Distribution w(θ, t)\nThe angular power distribution $w(\\theta, t)$ is the energy emitted per unit time per unit solid angle in frame $S$. This is the product of the photon emission rate per solid angle (calculated in Step 2) and the energy of a single photon as measured in frame $S$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe angular power distribution is the product of the photon flux and the energy per photon.\n\\[\\boxed{w(\\theta, t) = \\frac{d^2 E_{emitted}}{dt d\\Omega} = E_{ph}(\\theta) \\frac{d^2 N_{ph}}{dt d\\Omega}}\\]\nThe energy of a photon in frame $S$, $E_{ph}(\\theta)$, is related to its energy in the rest frame, $E_0$, by the relativistic Doppler effect.\n\\[\\boxed{E_{ph}(\\theta) = E_0 \\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}{1-\\beta\\cos\\theta}}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nWe multiply the photon flux in frame $S$ (Eq. \\ref{eq:photon_flux_S}) by the energy of a photon in frame $S$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nw(\\theta, t) &= \\left( \\frac{\\lambda N_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{(1-\\beta^2)^{3/2}}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)^2} e^{-\\lambda t'} \\right) \\cdot \\left( E_0 \\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}{1-\\beta\\cos\\theta} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\lambda N_0 E_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{(1-\\beta^2)^{3/2} (1-\\beta^2)^{1/2}}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)^2 (1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)} e^{-\\lambda t'} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\lambda N_0 E_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{(1-\\beta^2)^2}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)^3} e^{-\\lambda t'} \\label{eq:power_dist_t_prime} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Expression in Lab Frame Variables\nThe expression for $w(\\theta, t)$ in Eq. \\eqref{eq:power_dist_t_prime} depends on the time $t'$ in the atom's rest frame. To get the final answer, we must express it in terms of the time $t$ measured in the lab frame $S$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe proper time $t'$ of the moving atoms is related to the time $t$ in the lab frame by the time dilation formula.

Specifically, the magnetic field expression lacks the `\\mu_0` constant typical of SI units. This suggests that to solve the problem consistently, we should work within a framework of symmetrized Maxwell's equations, such as the Heaviside-Lorentz system, where `\\varepsilon_0` and `\\mu_0` are set to 1. We will introduce a magnetic charge density `\\omega` and a magnetic current density `\\boldsymbol{k}`. For a point magnetic charge `g` at position `\\boldsymbol{r}_g(t)` moving with velocity `\\boldsymbol{v}`, these are given by `\\omega(\\boldsymbol{r}, t) = g\\delta(\\boldsymbol{r}-\\boldsymbol{r}_g(t))` and `\\boldsymbol{k}(\\boldsymbol{r}, t) = g\\boldsymbol{v}\\delta(\\boldsymbol{r}-\\boldsymbol{r}_g(t))`.\n\n### Step 1: Postulate the Symmetrized Maxwell's Equations\nTo incorporate magnetic monopoles, we modify the standard Maxwell's equations based on the principle of electromagnetic duality, which suggests a symmetry between electric and magnetic phenomena.\n\nFirst, Gauss's law for magnetism is modified to include magnetic charge density `\\omega` as a source, analogous to how electric charge density `\\rho` sources the electric field.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{B} = \\omega}\n\\]\nThis is consistent with the given static magnetic field for a point charge `g`, as the divergence of this field is `\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{g \\boldsymbol{e}_{r}}{4\\pi r^{2}}\\right) = g\\delta(\\boldsymbol{r})`, which we identify as the magnetic charge density `\\omega`.\n\nSecond, Faraday's law of induction must be modified to include a magnetic current density `\\boldsymbol{k}` as a source term. The problem requires us to find `\\lambda` using charge conservation, which is itself a consequence of the field equations. This implies that `\\lambda` must appear in the fundamental equations. The magnetic current `\\boldsymbol{k}` is the source of the velocity-dependent electric field, so we hypothesize that `\\lambda` appears as a coefficient for the `\\boldsymbol{k}` term in the modified Faraday's law. We postulate the following form, which is dimensionally consistent in a symmetric system of units (like Heaviside-Lorentz with `c` explicit):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{E} = \\frac{\\lambda}{c}\\boldsymbol{k} - \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t}}\n\\]\nHere, the term `- \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t}` is the standard term from Faraday's law in these units, and `\\frac{\\lambda}{c}\\boldsymbol{k}` is the new source term.\n\n### Step 2: State the Principle of Magnetic Charge Conservation\nThe conservation of magnetic charge is a fundamental physical principle, analogous to the conservation of electric charge. It is expressed mathematically by the continuity equation, which relates the time rate of change of magnetic charge density `\\omega` to the divergence of the magnetic current density `\\boldsymbol{k}`.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\partial\\omega}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{k} = 0}\n\\]\nThis equation states that the total magnetic charge in a closed volume can only change by the amount of magnetic current flowing across its boundary.\n\n### Step 3: Derive the Continuity Equation from the Field Equations\nA mathematical consistency condition can be derived from our postulated Maxwell's equations. We start by taking the divergence of the modified Faraday's law from Step 1. We use the vector calculus identity that the divergence of the curl of any vector field is identically zero.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}) = 0}\n\\]\nApplying this identity to our postulated form of Faraday's law:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{E}) &= \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{c}\\boldsymbol{k} - \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t} \\right) \\label{eq:div_curl_E} \\\\\n0 &= \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{c}\\boldsymbol{k} \\right) - \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n0 &= \\frac{\\lambda}{c} (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k}) - \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}) \\label{eq:apply_identity}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn the last step, we used the fact that the divergence and time derivative operators commute.

The relation derived from the mathematical consistency of our postulated Maxwell's equations (from Step 3):\n    \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial t} = \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k}) \\label{eq:from_maxwell}\\end{align}\\]\n2.  The fundamental principle of magnetic charge conservation (from Step 2), which can be rewritten as:\n    \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial t} = -(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k}) \\label{eq:from_conservation}\\end{align}\\]\n\nFor our theory of electromagnetism with magnetic monopoles to be physically valid, both of these equations must hold true simultaneously for any arbitrary distribution of magnetic charges and currents. Therefore, the expressions on the right-hand sides of Equation \\ref{eq:from_maxwell} and Equation \\ref{eq:from_conservation} must be identical.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k}) &= -(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k}) \\label{eq:comparison}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis equality must be valid for any physical situation, including those where magnetic charge is flowing, which implies `\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{k} \\neq 0`. This is only possible if the coefficients of `\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{k}` on both sides are equal.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lambda = -1\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis result ensures that our postulated symmetric Maxwell's equations are fully consistent with the fundamental law of magnetic charge conservation.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe value of the constant `λ` is found to be -1.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\lambda = -1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The dominoes are modeled as identical, uniform, smooth slender rods, each with mass `m` and height `h`. They are connected to the ground by smooth hinges at their bases. Initially, all rods are standing vertically in a straight line, with a uniform distance `l` between adjacent hinges. A crucial condition is that this spacing is much smaller than the rod height, i.e., `l \\ll h`.\n\nThe process starts when the first rod is disturbed and begins to fall. It strikes the next rod, which then falls and strikes the one after it, and so on. The collisions between the rods are perfectly inelastic, characterized by a coefficient of restitution `e = 0`. We are asked to find the steady-state value of the initial angular velocity, `\\omega_{\\infty}`, which the angular velocity of a rod just after being struck approaches as the chain reaction propagates far down the line.\n\nThe variables and constants involved are:\n*   `m`: mass of each rod.\n*   `h`: height (length) of each rod.\n*   `l`: distance between the hinges of adjacent rods.\n*   `g`: acceleration due to gravity.\n*   `e = 0`: coefficient of restitution for collisions between rods.\n*   `\\omega_n`: the initial angular velocity of the `n`-th rod, immediately after it is struck by the `(n-1)`-th rod.\n*   `\\omega_{\\infty}`: the steady-state value of `\\omega_n` as `n \\to \\infty`.\n\nWe assume that the forces between rods are impulsive and act horizontally at the point of contact (the top of the rods). The hinges are smooth, implying they exert no frictional torque. The condition `l \\ll h` suggests that the angle of rotation of a rod before it strikes the next is small, which will justify certain mathematical approximations. For analyzing the motion, we can define `\\theta` as the angle a rod makes with the vertical axis.\n\n### Step 1: Equation of Motion of a Single Rod\nWe first derive the equation of motion for a single rod falling under gravity, rotating about its hinge. The motion is governed by Newton's second law for rotation.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\tau = I \\alpha}\\]\nHere, `\\tau` is the net torque about the hinge, `I` is the moment of inertia about the hinge, and `\\alpha = \\ddot{\\theta}` is the angular acceleration.\n\nThe torque is provided by the gravitational force, `F_g = mg`, acting at the rod's center of mass (at a distance `h/2` from the hinge). The lever arm is `(h/2)\\sin\\theta`.\n\\[\\boxed{\\tau_{\\text{gravity}} = F_g d = (mg) \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\sin\\theta\\right)}\\]\nThe moment of inertia of a slender rod of mass `m` and length `h` about an axis through one of its ends is:\n\\[\\boxed{I = \\frac{1}{3}mh^2}\\]\nSubstituting these into the rotational equation of motion:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI \\ddot{\\theta} &= \\tau_{\\text{gravity}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{1}{3}mh^2 \\ddot{\\theta} &= mg \\frac{h}{2}\\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n\\ddot{\\theta} &= \\frac{3g}{2h} \\sin\\theta\n\\label{eq:eom_exact} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe collision between the `n`-th and `(n+1)`-th rod occurs when the top of the `n`-th rod has moved a horizontal distance `l`. This happens at an angle `\\theta_0` such that `h\\sin\\theta_0 = l`. Given the problem condition `l \\ll h`, the angle `\\theta_0` must be small. For a small angle `\\theta`, we can use the approximation `\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta`.\n\\[\\boxed{\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\quad (\\text{for } \\theta \\ll 1)}\\]\nApplying this approximation to the equation of motion gives a linearized differential equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\ddot{\\theta} &\\approx \\frac{3g}{2h} \\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n\\ddot{\\theta} - \\rho^2 \\theta &= 0, \\quad \\text{where we define } \\rho^2 = \\frac{3g}{2h}\n\\label{eq:eom_approx} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Kinematics of a Falling Rod\nWe now solve the linearized equation of motion to find the rod's angular velocity just before it collides with the next one.\n\nThe general solution to the differential equation `\\ddot{\\theta} - \\rho^2 \\theta = 0` is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{\\theta(t) = A \\cosh(\\rho t) + B \\sinh(\\rho t)}\\]\nWe apply the initial conditions for the `n`-th rod. It starts its motion at `t=0` from a vertical position (`\\theta=0`) with an initial angular velocity `\\omega_n`. Thus, the initial conditions are `\\theta(0) = 0` and `\\dot{\\theta}(0) = \\omega_n`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\theta(0) &= A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 = A = 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta}(t) &= B\\rho \\cosh(\\rho t) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta}(0) &= B\\rho \\cosh(0) = B\\rho = \\omega_n \\implies B = \\frac{\\omega_n}{\\rho} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis gives the specific solutions for the angle and angular velocity of the `n`-th rod as a function of time:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\theta(t) &= \\frac{\\omega_n}{\\rho} \\sinh(\\rho t) \\label{eq:theta_t} \\tag{3} \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta}(t) &= \\omega_n \\cosh(\\rho t) \\label{eq:omega_t} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nCollision occurs at an angle `\\theta_0 \\approx l/h`. Let `t_n` be the time it takes for the `n`-th rod to reach this angle.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\theta(t_n) = \\frac{l}{h} \\implies \\frac{\\omega_n}{\\rho} \\sinh(\\rho t_n) = \\frac{l}{h} \\implies \\sinh(\\rho t_n) = \\frac{\\rho l}{h \\omega_n} \\label{eq:sinh} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe angular velocity of the `n`-th rod just before impact, `\\omega_{n, \\text{pre}}`, is `\\dot{\\theta}(t_n)`. We use the fundamental hyperbolic identity to find `\\cosh(\\rho t_n)`.\n\\[\\boxed{\\cosh^2(x) - \\sinh^2(x) = 1}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_{n, \\text{pre}} &= \\dot{\\theta}(t_n) = \\omega_n \\cosh(\\rho t_n) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\omega_n \\sqrt{1 + \\sinh^2(\\rho t_n)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\omega_n \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\rho l}{h \\omega_n}\\right)^2} \\quad (\\text{using eq. \\ref{eq:sinh}}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\omega_n^2 + \\frac{\\rho^2 l^2}{h^2}} \\label{eq:omega_pre} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Collision Analysis\nWe analyze the perfectly inelastic collision (`e=0`) between the `n`-th rod and the `(n+1)`-th rod. Let `\\omega_n'` be the angular velocity of the `n`-th rod immediately after collision, and `\\omega_{n+1}` be the angular velocity of the `(n+1)`-th rod immediately after collision. The collision involves a horizontal impulse `J` exchanged between the tops of the rods.\n\nWe apply the angular impulse-momentum theorem to each rod about its hinge.\n\\[\\boxed{\\Delta L = \\int \\tau_{\\text{ext}} dt = J_{\\tau}}\\]\nFor the `n`-th rod, at an angle `\\theta_0` to the vertical, the impulse `J` is retarding. The torque is `\\tau_J = -J \\cdot (h \\cos\\theta_0)`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI(\\omega_n' - \\omega_{n, \\text{pre}}) = -J h \\cos\\theta_0 \\label{eq:ang_mom_n} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor the `(n+1)`-th rod, which is initially vertical (`\\theta=0`), the impulse `J` is driving. The torque is `\\tau_J = J \\cdot h`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI(\\omega_{n+1} - 0) = J h \\label{eq:ang_mom_n+1} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe eliminate the impulse `J`. From eq. \\eqref{eq:ang_mom_n+1}, `J = I \\omega_{n+1} / h`. Substituting this into eq. \\eqref{eq:ang_mom_n}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI(\\omega_n' - \\omega_{n, \\text{pre}}) &= - \\left(\\frac{I \\omega_{n+1}}{h}\\right) h \\cos\\theta_0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega_n' - \\omega_{n, \\text{pre}} &= - \\omega_{n+1} \\cos\\theta_0 \\implies \\omega_{n, \\text{pre}} = \\omega_n' + \\omega_{n+1} \\cos\\theta_0 \\label{eq:momentum_cons} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we use the definition of the coefficient of restitution, `e`.\n\\[\\boxed{e = \\frac{v_{\\text{sep}}}{v_{\\text{app}}}}\\]\nThe velocities are the horizontal components at the contact point (height `h`). The approach velocity `v_{\\text{app}}` is the relative horizontal velocity before collision. The separation velocity `v_{\\text{sep}}` is the relative horizontal velocity after collision.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_{\\text{app}} &= v_{n, x, \\text{pre}} - v_{n+1, x, \\text{pre}} = (h \\omega_{n, \\text{pre}} \\cos\\theta_0) - 0 = h \\omega_{n, \\text{pre}} \\cos\\theta_0 \\nonumber \\\\\nv_{\\text{sep}} &= v_{n+1, x, \\text{post}} - v_{n, x, \\text{post}} = (h \\omega_{n+1}) - (h \\omega_n' \\cos\\theta_0) \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor a perfectly inelastic collision, `e=0`, which implies `v_{\\text{sep}} = 0`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nh \\omega_{n+1} - h \\omega_n' \\cos\\theta_0 = 0 \\implies \\omega_{n+1} = \\omega_n' \\cos\\theta_0 \\label{eq:restitution} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe now solve the system of equations \\eqref{eq:momentum_cons} and \\eqref{eq:restitution}. From \\eqref{eq:restitution}, `\\omega_n' = \\omega_{n+1} / \\cos\\theta_0`. Substituting into \\eqref{eq:momentum_cons}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_{n, \\text{pre}} &= \\frac{\\omega_{n+1}}{\\cos\\theta_0} + \\omega_{n+1} \\cos\\theta_0 = \\omega_{n+1} \\left(\\frac{1 + \\cos^2\\theta_0}{\\cos\\theta_0}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega_{n+1} &= \\omega_{n, \\text{pre}} \\left(\\frac{\\cos\\theta_0}{1 + \\cos^2\\theta_0}\\right) \\label{eq:omega_relation_exact} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince the collision angle `\\theta_0` is small, we can use the approximation for the cosine function.\n\\[\\boxed{\\cos\\theta_0 \\approx 1 \\quad (\\text{for } \\theta_0 \\ll 1)}\\]\nApplying this approximation to the relation above:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_{n+1} \\approx \\omega_{n, \\text{pre}} \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 1^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\omega_{n, \\text{pre}} \\label{eq:omega_relation_approx} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Recurrence Relation and Steady-State Solution\nBy substituting the expression for `\\omega_{n, \\text{pre}}` from eq. \\eqref{eq:omega_pre} into the approximate relation from eq. \\eqref{eq:omega_relation_approx}, we obtain a recurrence relation for the post-collision angular velocities.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\omega_n^2 + \\frac{\\rho^2 l^2}{h^2}} \\label{eq:recurrence_omega} \\tag{13}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo find the steady-state value, it is convenient to square both sides:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_{n+1}^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\omega_n^2 + \\frac{\\rho^2 l^2}{h^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\omega_n^2 + \\frac{\\rho^2 l^2}{4h^2} \\label{eq:recurrence_sq} \\tag{14}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe are seeking the steady-state angular velocity `\\omega_{\\infty}`. In the steady state, as `n \\to \\infty`, the angular velocity no longer changes from one domino to the next. This is expressed by the condition:\n\\[\\boxed{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\omega_n = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\omega_{n+1} = \\omega_{\\infty}}\\]\nApplying this condition to the recurrence relation for `\\omega_n^2` (eq. \\eqref{eq:recurrence_sq}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_{\\infty}^2 &= \\frac{1}{4}\\omega_{\\infty}^2 + \\frac{\\rho^2 l^2}{4h^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\omega_{\\infty}^2 &= \\frac{\\rho^2 l^2}{4h^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{3}{4}\\omega_{\\infty}^2 &= \\frac{\\rho^2 l^2}{4h^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega_{\\infty}^2 &= \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\rho^2 l^2}{h^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega_{\\infty} &= \\frac{\\rho l}{\\sqrt{3} h} \\label{eq:omega_inf_rho} \\tag{15}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis fixed point is stable because the recurrence relation for `x_n = \\omega_n^2` is of the form `x_{n+1} = ax_n + b` with `a=1/4`. Since `|a|<1`, the sequence converges to the fixed point regardless of the initial condition `\\omega_1`.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for `\\rho = \\sqrt{3g/(2h)}` from Step 1 into our result for `\\omega_{\\infty}`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_{\\infty} &= \\frac{l}{\\sqrt{3} h} \\sqrt{\\frac{3g}{2h}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{l}{h} \\sqrt{\\frac{3g}{3 \\cdot 2h}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{l}{h} \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{2h}} \\label{eq:final_expression} \\tag{16}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe steady-state post-collision angular velocity `\\omega_{\\infty}` is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\omega_{\\infty} = \\frac{l}{h}\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{2h}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The system consists of four infinitely long, straight lines of charge, all parallel to the $z$-axis. A positive ion is placed near the origin and is subject to the electric field from these lines, as well as fictitious forces due to a rotation of the entire line charge assembly.\n\nThe given information is as follows:\n*   **Charged Lines Configuration**:\n    1.  A line with uniform positive charge density $+\\lambda$ is located at $(x=a, y=0)$.\n    2.  A line with uniform positive charge density $+\\lambda$ is located at $(x=-a, y=0)$.\n    3.  A line with uniform negative charge density $-\\lambda$ is located at $(x=0, y=a)$.\n    4.  A line with uniform negative charge density $-\\lambda$ is located at $(x=0, y=-a)$.\n    We assume $\\lambda > 0$.\n*   **Electric Potential Reference**: For each individual line charge, the electric potential is defined to be zero at a perpendicular distance $a$ from that line.\n*   **Test Particle**: A positive ion with mass $m$ and charge $q$ (where $q>0$).\n*   **Motion Constraints**: The ion's motion is restricted to the $xy$-plane and it is located near the origin, which implies its coordinates $(x,y)$ satisfy $x \\ll a$ and $y \\ll a$.\n*   **System Dynamics**: The entire assembly of four charged lines rotates counterclockwise about the $z$-axis with a constant angular velocity $\\vec{\\Omega} = \\Omega \\hat{k}$.\n*   **Objective**: Find the minimum angular velocity, $\\Omega_{\\min}$, required for the ion to be in a state of stable equilibrium near the origin.\n*   **Constants**: The vacuum permittivity is $\\varepsilon_{0}$.\n\n### Step 1: Electric Potential from the Four Charged Lines\nWe first determine the total electric potential $U(x,y)$ at a point $(x,y)$ near the origin due to the four charged lines. We use the principle of superposition, summing the potentials from each line.\n\n\\[\\boxed{V(r) = -\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{line}}}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{r_0}\\right)}\\]\nThis is the general formula for the electric potential of an infinite line charge with density $\\lambda_{\\text{line}}$ at a perpendicular distance $r$, where $r_0$ is the reference distance at which the potential is zero. In this problem, we are given $r_0 = a$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{U_{\\text{total}}(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} V_i(x,y)}\\]\nThis is the principle of superposition for electric potential.\n\nThe distances from a point $(x,y)$ to the four lines are:\n*   $r_1 = \\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + y^2}$ for the line at $(a,0)$ with charge density $+\\lambda$.\n*   $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + y^2}$ for the line at $(-a,0)$ with charge density $+\\lambda$.\n*   $r_3 = \\sqrt{x^2 + (y-a)^2}$ for the line at $(0,a)$ with charge density $-\\lambda$.\n*   $r_4 = \\sqrt{x^2 + (y+a)^2}$ for the line at $(0,-a)$ with charge density $-\\lambda$.\n\nApplying the superposition principle, the total potential $U(x,y)$ is the sum of the potentials from each line:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(x,y) &= V_1(r_1, +\\lambda) + V_2(r_2, +\\lambda) + V_3(r_3, -\\lambda) + V_4(r_4, -\\lambda) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left[-\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_1}{a}\\right)\\right] + \\left[-\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{a}\\right)\\right] + \\left[-\\frac{-\\lambda}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_3}{a}\\right)\\right] + \\left[-\\frac{-\\lambda}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_4}{a}\\right)\\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_3}{a}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_4}{a}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_1}{a}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{a}\\right) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\ln\\left( \\frac{r_3 r_4}{r_1 r_2} \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\ln\\left( \\frac{r_3^2 r_4^2}{r_1^2 r_2^2} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\ln\\left( \\frac{(x^2 + (y-a)^2)(x^2 + (y+a)^2)}{((x-a)^2 + y^2)((x+a)^2 + y^2)} \\right) \\label{eq:potential_exact} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Approximate the Electric Potential for Small Displacements\nSince the ion is near the origin, we have $x \\ll a$ and $y \\ll a$. We can approximate the potential using a Taylor expansion. We will expand the argument of the logarithm in Eq. \\eqref{eq:potential_exact} up to second order in the small quantities $x/a$ and $y/a$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\ln(1+u) \\approx u \\text{ for } u \\ll 1}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{(1+\\epsilon)^n \\approx 1+n\\epsilon \\text{ for } \\epsilon \\ll 1}\\]\n\nFirst, we expand the numerator of the argument in Eq. \\eqref{eq:potential_exact}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(x^2 + (y-a)^2)(x^2 + (y+a)^2) &= (x^2+y^2+a^2-2ay)(x^2+y^2+a^2+2ay) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (x^2+y^2+a^2)^2 - (2ay)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= a^4\\left(1+\\frac{x^2+y^2}{a^2}\\right)^2 - 4a^2y^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx a^4\\left(1+2\\frac{x^2+y^2}{a^2}\\right) - 4a^2y^2 = a^4+2a^2x^2+2a^2y^2 - 4a^2y^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= a^4+2a^2(x^2-y^2) = a^4\\left(1+2\\frac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}\\right) \\label{eq:num_approx} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we expand the denominator of the argument:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n((x-a)^2 + y^2)((x+a)^2 + y^2) &= (x^2-2ax+a^2+y^2)(x^2+2ax+a^2+y^2) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (x^2+y^2+a^2)^2 - (2ax)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx a^4\\left(1+2\\frac{x^2+y^2}{a^2}\\right) - 4a^2x^2 = a^4+2a^2x^2+2a^2y^2 - 4a^2x^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= a^4-2a^2(x^2-y^2) = a^4\\left(1-2\\frac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}\\right) \\label{eq:den_approx} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe argument of the logarithm is approximately:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{a^4\\left(1+2\\frac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}\\right)}{a^4\\left(1-2\\frac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}\\right)} = \\frac{1+2\\frac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}}{1-2\\frac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}} \\approx \\left(1+2\\frac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}\\right)\\left(1+2\\frac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}\\right) \\approx 1+4\\frac{x^2-y^2}{a^2} \\label{eq:arg_approx} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing $\\ln(1+u) \\approx u$ for small $u = 4(x^2-y^2)/a^2$, the potential becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(x,y) &\\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{4(x^2-y^2)}{a^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left(\\frac{4(x^2-y^2)}{a^2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a^2}(x^2 - y^2) \\label{eq:potential_approx} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Electric Field and Force in the Lab Frame\nThe electric field $\\vec{E}$ is the negative gradient of the potential $U$. The electric force $\\vec{F}_e$ on the ion is $q\\vec{E}$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{E} = -\\vec{\\nabla}U = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\hat{j}\\right)}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_e = q\\vec{E}}\\]\nUsing the approximate potential from Eq. \\eqref{eq:potential_approx}, we find the components of the electric field:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_x &= -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda(x^2 - y^2)}{\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a^2}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\lambda x}{\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a^2} \\label{eq:Ex} \\tag{6} \\\\\nE_y &= -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda(x^2 - y^2)}{\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a^2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\lambda y}{\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a^2} \\label{eq:Ey} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe components of the electric force on the ion are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF_{e,x} &= qE_x = -\\frac{2q\\lambda}{\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a^2}x \\label{eq:Fex} \\tag{8} \\\\\nF_{e,y} &= qE_y = \\frac{2q\\lambda}{\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a^2}y \\label{eq:Fey} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Equations of Motion in the Rotating Frame\nTo analyze stability, it is convenient to work in the frame of reference that rotates with the charged lines at angular velocity $\\vec{\\Omega} = \\Omega\\hat{k}$. In this non-inertial frame, the ion's motion is governed by an effective force, which includes the true physical force (electric force) and fictitious forces (centrifugal and Coriolis).\n\n\\[\\boxed{m\\vec{a}_r = \\vec{F}_{\\text{physical}} + \\vec{F}_{\\text{centrifugal}} + \\vec{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}}}\\]\nThe fictitious forces for a particle at position $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}$ with velocity $\\vec{v}_r = \\dot{x}\\hat{i} + \\dot{y}\\hat{j}$ in the rotating frame are:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{\\text{centrifugal}} = -m\\vec{\\Omega} \\times (\\vec{\\Omega} \\times \\vec{r})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}} = -2m(\\vec{\\Omega} \\times \\vec{v}_r)}\\]\nLet's calculate these forces explicitly:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{F}_{\\text{centrifugal}} &= -m(\\Omega\\hat{k}) \\times ((\\Omega\\hat{k}) \\times (x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j})) = -m(\\Omega\\hat{k}) \\times (\\Omega x\\hat{j} - \\Omega y\\hat{i}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -m\\Omega^2 (x(\\hat{k}\\times\\hat{j}) - y(\\hat{k}\\times\\hat{i})) = -m\\Omega^2(-x\\hat{i} - y\\hat{j}) = m\\Omega^2(x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}) \\label{eq:F_cent} \\tag{10} \\\\\n\\vec{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}} &= -2m(\\Omega\\hat{k}) \\times (\\dot{x}\\hat{i} + \\dot{y}\\hat{j}) = -2m(\\Omega\\dot{x}\\hat{j} - \\Omega\\dot{y}\\hat{i}) = 2m\\Omega\\dot{y}\\hat{i} - 2m\\Omega\\dot{x}\\hat{j} \\label{eq:F_cor} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe physical force is the electric force $\\vec{F}_e$ from Eqs. \\eqref{eq:Fex} and \\eqref{eq:Fey}. Let's define a characteristic frequency squared, $\\omega_0^2$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_0^2 = \\frac{2q\\lambda}{m\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a^2} \\label{eq:omega0_def} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\nSince $q, \\lambda, m, \\varepsilon_0$ are all positive, $\\omega_0^2 > 0$. The electric force can be written as $\\vec{F}_e = -m\\omega_0^2 x \\hat{i} + m\\omega_0^2 y \\hat{j}$.\nThe equations of motion in the rotating frame ($m\\ddot{x}$ and $m\\ddot{y}$) are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm\\ddot{x} &= F_{e,x} + F_{\\text{cent},x} + F_{\\text{Cor},x} = -m\\omega_0^2 x + m\\Omega^2 x + 2m\\Omega\\dot{y} \\label{eq:motion_x_raw} \\tag{13} \\\\\nm\\ddot{y} &= F_{e,y} + F_{\\text{cent},y} + F_{\\text{Cor},y} = m\\omega_0^2 y + m\\Omega^2 y - 2m\\Omega\\dot{x} \\label{eq:motion_y_raw} \\tag{14}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nDividing by $m$ and rearranging gives the coupled system of differential equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\ddot{x} - 2\\Omega\\dot{y} + (\\omega_0^2 - \\Omega^2)x &= 0 \\label{eq:motion_x_final} \\tag{15} \\\\\n\\ddot{y} + 2\\Omega\\dot{x} - (\\omega_0^2 + \\Omega^2)y &= 0 \\label{eq:motion_y_final} \\tag{16}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Stability Analysis\nFor the origin to be a point of stable equilibrium, any small displacement from it must result in bounded, oscillatory motion. We analyze the stability by finding the normal mode frequencies of the system.\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{A trial solution of the form } x(t) = A e^{i\\omega t}, y(t) = B e^{i\\omega t} \\text{ is assumed.}}\\]\nFor the system to be stable, the normal mode frequencies $\\omega$ must all be real.

The object has a mass `m` and an electric charge `q`. The elliptical track is defined by the Cartesian equation $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where `a` and `b` are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively, with the condition $a > b > 0$. The term \"smooth\" implies that the track is frictionless.\n\nAt the origin (0,0), which is the center of the ellipse, a fixed point charge with charge `Q` is located. It is given that the charges `q` and `Q` have the same sign, which means their product `Qq` is positive, resulting in a repulsive electrostatic force between them. We assume both `q` and `Q` are point charges.\n\nThe task is to determine the period `T` of small oscillations of the object `q` when it is slightly displaced from its stable equilibrium position on the track.\n\nThe relevant physical quantities are:\n*   `m`: mass of the small movable object.\n*   `q`: charge of the small movable object.\n*   `Q`: charge of the fixed point charge at the origin.\n*   `a`: semi-major axis of the ellipse.\n*   `b`: semi-minor axis of the ellipse.\n*   $\\epsilon_0$: permittivity of free space, a constant in the expression for electrostatic force.\n*   `T`: the period of small oscillations we need to find.\n\nWe will analyze the system using polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where `r` is the distance of the object from the origin and `θ` is the angle its position vector makes with the positive x-axis. The analysis will rely on approximations for small displacements.\n\n### Step 1: Finding the Stable Equilibrium Position\nThe equilibrium positions of the object on the track are the points where the net tangential force is zero. Since the electrostatic force is the only non-constraint force doing work, these positions can also be found by analyzing the electrostatic potential energy of the system.

The sphere carries a total charge $Q$ which is uniformly distributed throughout its volume, and it rotates with a constant angular velocity $\\omega$ about the vertical $z$-axis passing through its center. This sphere is levitating in a stable, stationary position above an infinitely large superconducting plate. The center of the sphere is at a height $h$ above the plate. The system is under the influence of gravity, with gravitational acceleration $g$.\n\nWe are asked to determine the equilibrium height $h$. The vacuum permittivity and permeability are given as $\\epsilon_0$ and $\\mu_0$, respectively.\n\nThe physical situation involves a balance of forces acting on the sphere along the vertical $z$-axis. For the sphere to remain stationary, the net force must be zero. The forces involved are:\n1.  **Gravitational Force ($\\vec{F}_g$)**: Acting downwards due to the sphere's mass.\n2.  **Electric Force ($\\vec{F}_e$)**: An attractive force acting downwards, arising from the interaction between the charged sphere and the induced charges on the superconducting plate.\n3.  **Magnetic Force ($\\vec{F}_m$)**: A repulsive force acting upwards, arising from the interaction between the magnetic dipole moment of the rotating sphere and the induced supercurrents on the superconducting plate.\n\n**Variables:**\n*   $m$: mass of the sphere.\n*   $R$: radius of the sphere.\n*   $Q$: total charge on the sphere.\n*   $\\omega$: constant angular velocity of the sphere.\n*   $h$: distance from the center of the sphere to the surface of the plate.\n*   $g$: acceleration due to gravity.\n*   $\\epsilon_0$: vacuum permittivity.\n*   $\\mu_0$: vacuum permeability.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1.  The sphere has a uniform volume charge distribution.\n2.  The levitation height is much larger than the sphere's radius ($h \\gg R$). This allows us to approximate the sphere as a point charge for calculating the electric force and as a point magnetic dipole for calculating the magnetic force.\n3.  The superconducting plate is a perfect conductor for electrostatic effects and a perfect diamagnet for magnetostatic effects.\n4.  Dissipative effects, such as air resistance, are neglected.\n\n### Step 1: Calculation of the Magnetic Dipole Moment (μ)\nThe rotation of the volume charge creates microscopic currents. The total magnetic dipole moment is the vector sum (integral) of the magnetic moments of all infinitesimal current loops that constitute the sphere.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe magnetic dipole moment of an infinitesimal current loop is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{d\\vec{\\mu} = I d\\vec{A}}\\]\nThe uniform volume charge density $\\rho$ for a sphere with total charge $Q$ and volume $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\rho = \\frac{Q}{V} = \\frac{Q}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3}}\\]\nThe current $dI$ generated by a rotating charge element $dq$ with angular velocity $\\omega$ (period $T=2\\pi/\\omega$) is:\n\\[\\boxed{dI = \\frac{dq}{T} = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} dq}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nWe consider an infinitesimal ring of charge within the sphere at a radial distance $r'$ from the center ($0 \\le r' \\le R$) and at a polar angle $\\theta$. The radius of this ring's rotation about the $z$-axis is $r' \\sin\\theta$. The volume of this infinitesimal ring is $dV = (2\\pi r'\\sin\\theta) (r' d\\theta dr') = 2\\pi r'^2 \\sin\\theta dr' d\\theta$.\nThe charge on this ring is $dq = \\rho dV$. This rotating ring constitutes a current loop with current $dI$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ndI &= \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} dq = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} (\\rho \\cdot 2\\pi r'^2 \\sin\\theta dr' d\\theta) = \\rho \\omega r'^2 \\sin\\theta dr' d\\theta\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe area of this current loop is $A = \\pi (r' \\sin\\theta)^2 = \\pi r'^2 \\sin^2\\theta$. The area vector $\\vec{A}$ is directed along the axis of rotation, the $z$-axis. The magnetic moment of this loop, $d\\vec{\\mu}$, is also along the $z$-axis, and its magnitude is $d\\mu_z = A \\cdot dI$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nd\\mu_z &= (\\pi r'^2 \\sin^2\\theta) (\\rho \\omega r'^2 \\sin\\theta dr' d\\theta) = \\pi \\rho \\omega r'^4 \\sin^3\\theta dr' d\\theta\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo find the total magnetic moment $\\mu$, we integrate over the entire volume of the sphere by integrating $r'$ from $0$ to $R$ and $\\theta$ from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mu &= \\int_0^R \\int_0^\\pi d\\mu_z = \\int_0^R \\int_0^\\pi \\pi \\rho \\omega r'^4 \\sin^3\\theta d\\theta dr' = \\pi \\rho \\omega \\left(\\int_0^R r'^4 dr'\\right) \\left(\\int_0^\\pi \\sin^3\\theta d\\theta\\right) \\label{eq:mu_integral}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe separate integrals are evaluated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^R r'^4 dr' &= \\left[\\frac{r'^5}{5}\\right]_0^R = \\frac{R^5}{5} \\\\\n\\int_0^\\pi \\sin^3\\theta d\\theta &= \\int_0^\\pi (1-\\cos^2\\theta)\\sin\\theta d\\theta = \\left[-\\cos\\theta + \\frac{\\cos^3\\theta}{3}\\right]_0^\\pi = \\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\left(-1+\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting these results and the expression for charge density $\\rho = \\frac{3Q}{4\\pi R^3}$ into eq. \\eqref{eq:mu_integral}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mu = \\pi \\left(\\frac{3Q}{4\\pi R^3}\\right) \\omega \\left(\\frac{R^5}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}Q\\omega R^2 \\label{eq:mu_final}\n\\endalignd}\n\\]\nThe magnetic moment vector is $\\vec{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{5}Q\\omega R^2 \\hat{z}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Electric Force ($\\vec{F}_e$)\nThe electric force on the charged sphere is due to the induced charges on the surface of the superconducting plate. In electrostatics, a superconductor acts as a perfect conductor, so we can use the method of images.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe electrostatic force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\\hat{r}}\\]\nThe method of images for a point charge $Q$ at a distance $h$ from an infinite grounded conducting plane states that the field in the region of the charge is equivalent to that produced by the original charge and an image charge $-Q$ located at a distance $h$ behind the plane.\n\n**Derivation:**\nUnder the assumption $h \\gg R$, we approximate the sphere as a point charge $Q$ located at its center, $z=h$. The superconducting plate is at $z=0$. The image charge is $-Q$ and is located at $z=-h$. The distance between the real charge and the image charge is $r = 2h$. The force on the real charge is the attractive force exerted by the image charge.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{F}_e = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(Q)(-Q)}{(2h)^2} \\hat{z} = -\\frac{Q^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_0 h^2} \\hat{z} \\label{eq:Fe}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is attractive, directed in the negative $z$-direction (downwards).\n\n### Step 3: Determination of the Magnetic Force ($\\vec{F}_m$)\nThe rotating sphere acts as a magnetic dipole $\\vec{\\mu}$. A superconductor is a perfect diamagnet, which expels magnetic fields. This interaction can be modeled using an image dipole.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe method of images for a magnetic dipole $\\vec{\\mu}$ near a perfectly diamagnetic plane (superconductor) states that the image dipole $\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{image}}$ is formed by reversing the component of $\\vec{\\mu}$ perpendicular to the plane ($\\vec{\\mu}_{\\perp}$) and keeping the component parallel to the plane ($\\vec{\\mu}_{\\parallel}$) the same.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{image}} = \\vec{\\mu}_{\\parallel} - \\vec{\\mu}_{\\perp}}\\]\nThe on-axis magnetic field of a dipole $\\vec{\\mu}'$ at a distance $d$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{B}_{\\text{dipole}}(d) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{\\mu}'}{d^3}}\\]\nThe potential energy $W$ of the dipole-plate system is half the interaction energy of the dipole with the field from its image.\n\\[\\boxed{W = \\frac{1}{2} U_{int} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{\\text{image}}}\\]\nThe force on the dipole is the negative gradient of its potential energy:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F} = -\\nabla W}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu} = \\mu \\hat{z}$ is perpendicular to the plate. Thus, $\\vec{\\mu}_{\\perp} = \\vec{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{\\mu}_{\\parallel} = 0$. The image dipole, located at $z=-h$, is $\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{image}} = 0 - \\vec{\\mu} = -\\mu\\hat{z}$. The magnetic field at the location of the real dipole ($z=h$) due to its image is $\\vec{B}_{\\text{image}}$. The distance between the real and image dipoles is $d=2h$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{B}_{\\text{image}} &= \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{image}}}{d^3} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi} \\frac{(-\\mu \\hat{z})}{(2h)^3} = -\\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu}{16\\pi h^3} \\hat{z}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe potential energy of the sphere-plate system is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nW(h) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{\\text{image}} = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\mu \\hat{z}) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu}{16\\pi h^3} \\hat{z}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu^2}{32\\pi h^3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe force is purely in the $z$-direction and is found by taking the negative derivative of the potential energy with respect to height $h$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{F}_m = -\\frac{dW}{dh} \\hat{z} = -\\frac{d}{dh}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu^2}{32\\pi h^3}\\right) \\hat{z} = - \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu^2}{32\\pi}\\right)(-3h^{-4}) \\hat{z} = \\frac{3\\mu_0 \\mu^2}{32\\pi h^4} \\hat{z} \\label{eq:Fm}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe positive sign indicates that the force is repulsive, directed in the positive $z$-direction (upwards).\n\n### Step 4: Establishing the Force Balance Equation\nFor the sphere to levitate at a stable height $h$, the net force on it must be zero. The upward magnetic force must balance the sum of the downward gravitational and electric forces.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nNewton's First Law (condition for static equilibrium):\n\\[\\boxed{\\sum \\vec{F} = \\vec{0}}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe gravitational force is $\\vec{F}_g = -mg\\hat{z}$. The total force on the sphere is $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\vec{F}_g + \\vec{F}_e + \\vec{F}_m$.

The physical setup and parameters are as follows:\n\n*   **Waveguide Geometry**: We consider a 2D slab waveguide, which is uniform in the direction perpendicular to the page (let's call it the z-direction). The waveguide extends along the x-direction, and the refractive index varies in the y-direction. The central layer, or core, has a thickness `b`. The interfaces between the core and the cladding are planes parallel to the xz-plane.\n*   **Refractive Indices**:\n    *   The core (incident medium) has a refractive index `n_1 = n`.\n    *   The cladding (refracting medium), present on both the top and bottom, has a refractive index `n_2 = n + \\delta n`.\n*   **Light Wave**: The light is a monochromatic wave with a vacuum wavelength `λ`. It propagates within the core and strikes the core-cladding interface.\n*   **Reflection Event**:\n    *   The angle of incidence, measured with respect to the normal to the interface (the y-axis), is `\\theta_1 = \\theta`.\n    *   The reflection is specified to be a Total Internal Reflection (TIR). For TIR to occur, two conditions must be met:\n        1.  Light must travel from a medium of higher refractive index to one of lower refractive index, i.e., `n_1 > n_2`. This implies `n > n + \\delta n`, which requires `\\delta n` to be a negative quantity.\n        2.  The angle of incidence `\\theta` must be greater than the critical angle `\\theta_c`, where `\\sin\\theta_c = n_2 / n_1`.\n*   **Given Formula and Assumption on Polarization**: The problem provides the Fresnel reflection coefficient:\n    $$r = \\frac{n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1}-n_{2}\\cos\\theta_{2}}{n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1}+n_{2}\\cos\\theta_{2}}$$\n    This specific formula corresponds to the case of s-polarized light (Transverse Electric or TE mode), where the electric field vector is perpendicular to the plane of incidence (the xy-plane). The entire derivation will be based on this assumption.\n*   **Objective**: Our goal is to determine the phase shift `φ` associated with this reflection. The phase shift is the argument of the complex reflection coefficient `r`, which can be written in polar form as `r = |r|e^{j\\varphi}`.\n\n### Step 1: Express the Reflection Coefficient using only the Angle of Incidence\nWe start with the given formula for the reflection coefficient `r`. To analyze its phase, we first need to express it solely in terms of the parameters of the incident medium (`n_1`, `\\theta_1`) and the refractive indices. This is achieved by eliminating the angle of refraction `\\theta_2` using Snell's Law.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ r = \\frac{n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1}-n_{2}\\cos\\theta_{2}}{n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1}+n_{2}\\cos\\theta_{2}} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ n_{1}\\sin\\theta_{1} = n_{2}\\sin\\theta_{2} \\quad (\\text{Snell's Law}) }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\cos^2\\alpha + \\sin^2\\alpha = 1 \\quad (\\text{Trigonometric Identity}) }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nFrom Snell's Law, we can express `\\sin\\theta_2` as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sin\\theta_{2} = \\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}\\sin\\theta_{1} \\label{eq:sin2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing the trigonometric identity, we find `\\cos\\theta_2`. Since `\\theta_2` represents a physical angle of refraction, it lies in the range `[0, \\pi/2]`, so its cosine is non-negative.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\cos\\theta_{2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\theta_{2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}\\sin\\theta_{1}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n_2^2 - n_1^2\\sin^2\\theta_1}}{n_2} \\label{eq:cos2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow, we substitute the expression for `n_2\\cos\\theta_2` into the formula for `r`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn_2\\cos\\theta_2 = \\sqrt{n_2^2 - n_1^2\\sin^2\\theta_1} \\label{eq:n2cos2}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\nr = \\frac{n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1}-\\sqrt{n_{2}^{2}-n_{1}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{1}}}{n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1}+\\sqrt{n_{2}^{2}-n_{1}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{1}}} \\label{eq:r_general}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Adapt the Reflection Coefficient for Total Internal Reflection\nThe condition for total internal reflection is that the angle of incidence `\\theta_1` is greater than the critical angle `\\theta_c`, which is mathematically equivalent to `n_1 \\sin\\theta_1 > n_2`. This inequality has a crucial consequence for the expression of `r` derived in Step 1.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{Condition for TIR: } n_{1}\\sin\\theta_{1} > n_{2} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ j = \\sqrt{-1} \\quad (\\text{Definition of imaginary unit}) }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe TIR condition `n_1 \\sin\\theta_1 > n_2` implies `n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta_1 > n_2^2`, which means the term inside the square root in eq. \\eqref{eq:r_general} is negative:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn_{2}^{2}-n_{1}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{1} < 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nWe can rewrite the square root by factoring out `-1`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sqrt{n_{2}^{2}-n_{1}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{1}} &= \\sqrt{-1 \\cdot (n_{1}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{1} - n_{2}^{2})} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= j \\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{1} - n_{2}^{2}} \\label{eq:sqrt_imaginary}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting this into eq. \\eqref{eq:r_general}, the reflection coefficient becomes a complex number.

This structure guarantees that the magnitude `|r| = |z^*|/|z| = 1`, meaning the intensity of the light is fully reflected, which is the definition of total internal reflection.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Phase Shift from the Complex Reflection Coefficient\nThe phase shift `φ` is the argument of the complex reflection coefficient `r`. For any complex number `z`, we can write it in polar form as `z = |z|e^{j\\phi}`, where `\\phi = \\arg(z)` is its phase or argument. Since `|r|=1`, we have `r = e^{j\\varphi}`.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ r = e^{j\\varphi} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{For a complex number } z = x+iy, \\text{ its argument is } \\arg(z) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\text{ (for x>0)} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\arg\\left(\\frac{z_1}{z_2}\\right) = \\arg(z_1) - \\arg(z_2) }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nLet's identify the real and imaginary parts in eq. \\eqref{eq:r_complex}. Let `X = n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1}` and `Y = \\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{1}-n_{2}^{2}}`. Both `X` and `Y` are real and positive under TIR conditions (assuming `\\theta_1 < \\pi/2`). The reflection coefficient is `r = (X - jY) / (X + jY)`.\nThe phase `φ` is the argument of `r`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\varphi = \\arg(r) &= \\arg(X - jY) - \\arg(X + jY) \\label{eq:phase_def}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe argument of the numerator is `\\arg(X - jY) = \\arctan(-Y/X) = -\\arctan(Y/X)` (since `X>0`).\nThe argument of the denominator is `\\arg(X + jY) = \\arctan(Y/X)` (since `X>0`).\nSubstituting these into eq. \\eqref{eq:phase_def}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\varphi &= -\\arctan\\left(\\frac{Y}{X}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{Y}{X}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{Y}{X}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{1}-n_{2}^{2}}}{n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1}}\\right) \\label{eq:phi_general}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 4: Substitute the Specific Waveguide Parameters\nFinally, we insert the specific parameters for the given optical fiber into the general expression for the phase shift `φ` derived in Step 3.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ n_1 = n \\quad (\\text{core refractive index}) }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ n_2 = n + \\delta n \\quad (\\text{cladding refractive index}) }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\theta_1 = \\theta \\quad (\\text{angle of incidence}) }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nSubstituting `n_1 = n`, `n_2 = n + \\delta n`, and `\\theta_1 = \\theta` into eq. \\eqref{eq:phi_general}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\varphi &= -2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta-(n+\\delta n)^{2}}}{n\\cos\\theta}\\right) \\label{eq:phi_sub}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo simplify the expression inside the arctangent, we can factor `n^2` out of the square root in the numerator:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{n^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta-(n+\\delta n)^{2}}}{n\\cos\\theta} &= \\frac{\\sqrt{n^2 \\left[ \\sin^{2}\\theta-\\frac{(n+\\delta n)^{2}}{n^2} \\right]}}{n\\cos\\theta} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{n\\sqrt{\\sin^{2}\\theta-\\left(\\frac{n+\\delta n}{n}\\right)^{2}}}{n\\cos\\theta} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sin^{2}\\theta - \\left(1+\\frac{\\delta n}{n}\\right)^{2}}}{\\cos\\theta} \\label{eq:phi_final_derivation}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting this simplified term back into eq. \\eqref{eq:phi_sub} gives the final expression for the phase shift.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe phase shift `φ` of the light after its first reflection, under the condition of total internal reflection and for s-polarized light, is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\varphi = -2\\arctan\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{\\sin^{2}\\theta - \\left(1+\\frac{\\delta n}{n}\\right)^{2}}}{\\cos\\theta}\\right]}\n\\end{align}\\]"}

The block is displaced vertically from its equilibrium position and released, causing it to oscillate.\n3.  A crucial condition is that during its motion, the block is \"neither fully submerged nor does it detach from the water surface.\" This ensures that the buoyant force is always proportional to the submerged depth, which leads to Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM).\n\nTo analyze the motion, we will define a vertical coordinate axis, $y$, with its origin ($y=0$) at the block's equilibrium position. The positive direction of the $y$-axis is upwards. We will also define:\n*   $S$: The constant cross-sectional area of the rectangular block.\n*   $m$: The mass of the block.

At equilibrium, the net force on the block is zero. The two forces acting on it are the downward gravitational force ($F_g$) and the upward buoyant force ($F_{B,eq}$).\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\sum F_y = 0 \\quad (\\text{Newton's First Law for Equilibrium})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{F_g = mg \\quad (\\text{Gravitational Force})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{F_B = \\rho_{\\text{fluid}} V_{\\text{submerged}} g \\quad (\\text{Archimedes' Principle})}\\]\n\nIn our coordinate system (upwards positive), the gravitational force is $F_g = -mg$.

Applying Newton's First Law:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum F_y &= F_{B,eq} + F_g = 0 \\label{eq:equilibrium_force_balance} \\\\\n\\rho_2 (h_0 S) g - mg &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\rho_2 h_0 S g &= mg \\label{eq:equilibrium_forces}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the mass of the block, $m = \\rho_1 H S$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_2 h_0 S g &= (\\rho_1 H S) g \\nonumber \\\\\n\\rho_2 h_0 &= \\rho_1 H \\nonumber \\\\\nh_0 &= H \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} \\label{eq:h0}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis equation gives the submerged depth of the block at its equilibrium position.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Net Force for a Vertical Displacement\nNow, we analyze the forces on the block when it is displaced by a distance $y$ from its equilibrium position. When the block is at position $y$, its new submerged depth is $h = h_0 - y$. A positive $y$ (upward displacement) decreases the submerged depth, while a negative $y$ (downward displacement) increases it. The net force on the block will cause it to accelerate.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\sum F_y = ma_y \\quad (\\text{Newton's Second Law})}\\]\n\nThe gravitational force $F_g = -mg$ is constant.

A large wedge-shaped block of mass $M$ and inclination angle $\\theta$ rests on a smooth (frictionless) horizontal tabletop. A smaller block of mass $m$ is placed on the frictionless inclined surface of the wedge. The small block is connected to the top of the wedge by a spring of spring constant $k$ and natural length $L_0$.\n\nThe system is initially at rest, with the small block positioned at a distance $L_0$ from the top of the wedge, meaning the spring is unstretched. The small block is then released and begins to oscillate along the incline. Due to the interaction forces between the two blocks, the wedge will also move horizontally on the tabletop.\n\nThe goal is to find the period of oscillation, $T$, of the small block $m$.\n\nWe define the following variables:\n*   $m$: mass of the small block.\n*   $M$: mass of the wedge.\n*   $\\theta$: inclination angle of the wedge with the horizontal.\n*   $k$: spring constant of the spring.\n*   $L_0$: natural length of the spring.\n*   $g$: acceleration due to gravity.\n\nWe assume all surfaces are frictionless and the spring is massless.\n\n### Step 1: Coordinate Systems and Kinematic Relations\nTo analyze the motion, we establish two coordinate systems.\n1.  An inertial frame of reference $(x, y)$ fixed to the tabletop, with the $x$-axis horizontal (positive to the right) and the $y$-axis vertical (positive upwards).\n2.  A non-inertial frame of reference $(x', y')$ attached to the wedge, with the $x'$-axis pointing down the incline and the $y'$-axis perpendicular to the incline, pointing away from the wedge surface.\n\nThe relationship between the unit vectors of the two frames is a key geometric relation.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{x'} &= \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{i} - \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{j} \\\\\n\\hat{y'} &= \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{i} + \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{j}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\\]\nThe relationship between the absolute acceleration of the block $m$ ($\\vec{a}_m$), the acceleration of the wedge $M$ ($\\vec{A}_M$), and the acceleration of the block $m$ relative to the wedge ($\\vec{a}_{rel}$) is given by the principle of relative motion.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{a}_m = \\vec{A}_M + \\vec{a}_{rel}}\\]\nWe apply this principle to our specific problem. The wedge can only move horizontally, so $\\vec{A}_M = A_x \\hat{i}$. The block $m$ is constrained to move along the incline relative to the wedge, so $\\vec{a}_{rel} = a_r \\hat{x'}$, where $a_r = \\ddot{s}$ and $s$ is the position of the block along the incline measured from the top. To apply Newton's laws in the wedge's frame, we express $\\vec{a}_m$ in the $(x', y')$ basis. First, we express $\\vec{A}_M$ in this basis: $\\vec{A}_M = A_x \\hat{i} = A_x (\\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{x'} + \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{y'})$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{a}_m &= (A_x \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{x'} + A_x \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{y'}) + a_r \\hat{x'} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (a_r + A_x \\cos\\theta)\\hat{x'} + (A_x \\sin\\theta)\\hat{y'} \\label{eq:am_components} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom this, we identify the components of the absolute acceleration in the primed frame:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na_{m,x'} &= a_r + A_x \\cos\\theta \\label{eq:amx} \\tag{2} \\\\\na_{m,y'} &= A_x \\sin\\theta \\label{eq:amy} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Equations of Motion for the Block m\nWe apply Newton's Second Law to the small block $m$. The forces acting on it are gravity ($m\\vec{g} = -mg\\hat{j}$), the normal force from the wedge ($\\vec{N} = N\\hat{y'}$), and the spring force ($\\vec{F}_s = -F_s\\hat{x'}$).\n\\[\\boxed{\\sum \\vec{F}_m = m\\vec{a}_m}\\]\nWe resolve the forces and acceleration in the $(x', y')$ directions.\n*   **In the $y'$-direction (perpendicular to the incline):** The component of gravity is $m\\vec{g} \\cdot \\hat{y'} = (-mg\\hat{j}) \\cdot (\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{i} + \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{j}) = -mg\\cos\\theta$. The normal force is $N$.\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\sum F_{m,y'} &= N - mg\\cos\\theta = m a_{m,y'} \\nonumber \\\\\n    N - mg\\cos\\theta &= m(A_x \\sin\\theta) \\quad (\\text{using eq. \\ref{eq:amy}}) \\nonumber \\\\\n    N &= mg\\cos\\theta + m A_x \\sin\\theta \\label{eq:force_m_y} \\tag{4}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n*   **In the $x'$-direction (along the incline):** The component of gravity is $m\\vec{g} \\cdot \\hat{x'} = (-mg\\hat{j}) \\cdot (\\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{i} - \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{j}) = mg\\sin\\theta$.

The horizontal forces on the wedge are the reaction forces from the block $m$.\n\\[\\boxed{\\sum \\vec{F}_M = M\\vec{A}_M}\\]\nBy Newton's third law, the forces exerted by the block on the wedge are the opposites of the forces the wedge exerts on the block.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\vec{N}' &= -\\vec{N} \\\\\n\\vec{F}_s' &= -\\vec{F}_s\n\\end{aligned}\n}\\]\nThe force $\\vec{N}' = -N\\hat{y'}$ acts on the wedge. Its horizontal component is $(-N\\hat{y'}) \\cdot \\hat{i} = -N\\sin\\theta$.\nThe force $\\vec{F}_s' = -(-F_s\\hat{x'}) = F_s\\hat{x'}$ acts on the wedge. Its horizontal component is $(F_s\\hat{x'}) \\cdot \\hat{i} = F_s\\cos\\theta$.\nThe net horizontal force on the wedge is the sum of these components.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum F_{M,x} &= F_s\\cos\\theta - N\\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\nF_s\\cos\\theta - N\\sin\\theta &= M A_x \\label{eq:force_M_x} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Deriving the Relative Acceleration\nWe now have a system of three linear equations (\\ref{eq:force_m_y}, \\ref{eq:force_m_x}, \\ref{eq:force_M_x}) for the unknowns $N$, $A_x$, and $a_r$. We solve for $a_r$ by eliminating $N$ and $A_x$. First, substitute $N$ from eq. (\\ref{eq:force_m_y}) into eq. (\\ref{eq:force_M_x}) to find $A_x$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF_s\\cos\\theta - (mg\\cos\\theta + m A_x \\sin\\theta)\\sin\\theta &= M A_x \\nonumber \\\\\nF_s\\cos\\theta - mg\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta - m A_x \\sin^2\\theta &= M A_x \\nonumber \\\\\nF_s\\cos\\theta - mg\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta &= (M + m\\sin^2\\theta)A_x \\nonumber \\\\\nA_x &= \\frac{F_s\\cos\\theta - mg\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta}{M + m\\sin^2\\theta} \\label{eq:Ax} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, substitute this expression for $A_x$ into eq. (\\ref{eq:force_m_x}) to find $a_r$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm a_r &= mg\\sin\\theta - F_s - m A_x \\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\nm a_r &= mg\\sin\\theta - F_s - m\\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{F_s\\cos\\theta - mg\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta}{M + m\\sin^2\\theta} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\nm a_r &= \\frac{(mg\\sin\\theta - F_s)(M + m\\sin^2\\theta) - m\\cos\\theta(F_s\\cos\\theta - mg\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta)}{M + m\\sin^2\\theta} \\nonumber \\\\\nm a_r &= \\frac{mg\\sin\\theta(M + m\\sin^2\\theta) - F_s(M + m\\sin^2\\theta) - F_s m\\cos^2\\theta + m^2g\\sin\\theta\\cos^2\\theta}{M + m\\sin^2\\theta} \\nonumber \\\\\nm a_r &= \\frac{mg\\sin\\theta(M + m(\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta)) - F_s(M + m(\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta))}{M + m\\sin^2\\theta} \\nonumber \\\\\nm a_r &= \\frac{(M+m)(mg\\sin\\theta - F_s)}{M + m\\sin^2\\theta} \\label{eq:ar_F} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Formulating the SHM Equation\nThe equation for the relative acceleration $a_r$ depends on the spring force $F_s$. We use Hooke's Law for the spring force and the definition of acceleration.\n\\[\\boxed{F_s = k(s-L_0)}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{a_r = \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}}\\]\nSubstituting these into eq.

To show this, we find the equilibrium position $s_{eq}$ where the net force term is zero, so acceleration is zero ($\\ddot{s}=0$).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nmg\\sin\\theta - k(s_{eq}-L_0) = 0 \\implies s_{eq} = L_0 + \\frac{mg\\sin\\theta}{k}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLet $s' = s - s_{eq}$ be the displacement from the equilibrium position. Then $s = s' + s_{eq}$ and $\\ddot{s} = \\ddot{s'}$. Also, $s-L_0 = s' + s_{eq} - L_0 = s' + \\frac{mg\\sin\\theta}{k}$. Substituting this into eq.

(\\ref{eq:shm}), with the standard form, we can identify the square of the angular frequency $\\omega^2$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{k(M+m)}{m(M + m\\sin^2\\theta)} \\label{eq:omega_sq} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe period of oscillation $T$ is related to the angular frequency $\\omega$ by the following principle:\n\\[\\boxed{T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}}\\]\nUsing the expression for $\\omega^2$ from eq. (\\ref{eq:omega_sq}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\omega^2}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m(M + m\\sin^2\\theta)}{k(M+m)}} \\label{eq:period} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe oscillation period of the small block $m$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m(M+m\\sin^{2}\\theta)}{k(M+m)}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

This force can be derived from the potential energy of the dipole in the field. The potential energy $U$ of a linear, isotropic dielectric object (with induced dipole moment $\\vec{p}$) in an external electric field $\\vec{E}_{\\text{ext}}$ is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{ U = -\\frac{1}{2} \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{E}_{\\text{ext}} }\\]\nThe force $\\vec{F}$ on the object is the negative gradient of its potential energy:\n\\[\\boxed{ \\vec{F} = -\\nabla U }\\]\nFirst, we express the potential energy $U$ as a function of the position $r$. We use the expression for the induced dipole moment from Eq. \\eqref{eq:dipole_moment}, which is proportional to the external field $\\vec{E}(r)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(r) &= -\\frac{1}{2} \\vec{p}(r) \\cdot \\vec{E}(r) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 3\\varepsilon_0 V \\frac{\\varepsilon_r - 1}{\\varepsilon_r + 2} \\vec{E}(r) \\right) \\cdot \\vec{E}(r) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 3\\varepsilon_0 V \\frac{\\varepsilon_r - 1}{\\varepsilon_r + 2} \\right) |\\vec{E}(r)|^2 \\label{eq:U_intermediate} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the magnitude of the electric field, $E(r) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}$, from Eq. \\eqref{eq:Efield}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(r) &= -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 3\\varepsilon_0 V \\frac{\\varepsilon_r - 1}{\\varepsilon_r + 2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= - \\frac{3V(\\varepsilon_r - 1)\\lambda^2}{8\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 (\\varepsilon_r + 2)r^2} \\label{eq:potential_energy} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the force by taking the negative gradient of the potential energy. In cylindrical coordinates, since $U$ depends only on the radial distance $r$, the gradient simplifies to $\\nabla U = \\frac{dU}{dr}\\hat{r}$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{F}(r) &= -\\nabla U(r) = - \\frac{dU(r)}{dr} \\hat{r} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= - \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( - \\frac{3V(\\varepsilon_r - 1)\\lambda^2}{8\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 (\\varepsilon_r + 2)r^2} \\right) \\hat{r} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left( \\frac{3V(\\varepsilon_r - 1)\\lambda^2}{8\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 (\\varepsilon_r + 2)} \\right) \\frac{d}{dr}(r^{-2}) \\hat{r} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left( \\frac{3V(\\varepsilon_r - 1)\\lambda^2}{8\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 (\\varepsilon_r + 2)} \\right) (-2r^{-3}) \\hat{r} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= - \\frac{6V(\\varepsilon_r - 1)\\lambda^2}{8\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 (\\varepsilon_r + 2)r^3} \\hat{r} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= - \\frac{3V(\\varepsilon_r - 1)\\lambda^2}{4\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 (\\varepsilon_r + 2)r^3} \\hat{r} \\label{eq:force_vector} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is attractive, directed towards the line of charge (in the $-\\hat{r}$ direction), assuming $\\varepsilon_r > 1$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe problem asks for the force acting on the particle and its magnitude. The force vector $\\vec{F}(r)$ is derived in Step 4. It is directed radially inward, towards the charged line (assuming $\\varepsilon_r > 1$).\n\nThe force vector is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\vec{F}(r) = - \\frac{3V(\\varepsilon_r - 1)\\lambda^2}{4\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 (\\varepsilon_r + 2)r^3} \\hat{r}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe magnitude of the force is the absolute value of the vector's component.

We consider a system composed of three layers. The middle layer is a thin film of thickness $d$ and refractive index $n_1$. This film is surrounded on both sides by a medium with a higher refractive index $n_2$. The relative refractive index is given as $n = n_1/n_2 < 1$.\n\nA monochromatic beam of s-polarized light, with wavelength $\\lambda$ in the surrounding medium ($n_2$), is incident from the medium $n_2$ onto the thin film at an angle of incidence $i_2$. The angle of refraction into the film is $i_1$. The condition for total internal reflection (TIR) is met at the first interface, which means the angle of incidence $i_2$ is greater than the critical angle $i_c = \\arcsin(n)$.\n\nDue to the finite thickness $d$ of the film, the evanescent wave in the film can reach the second interface and transmit some energy into the third layer (also medium $n_2$). This process is known as tunneling. We need to find the total reflectance, $R_s$, which is the ratio of the total reflected light intensity to the incident light intensity, after accounting for the infinite series of reflections and transmissions within the structure.\n\nThe variables are:\n-   $n_1$: Refractive index of the thin film.\n-   $n_2$: Refractive index of the surrounding medium.\n-   $n = n_1/n_2$: Relative refractive index, with $n < 1$.\n-   $d$: Thickness of the thin film.\n-   $\\lambda$: Wavelength of light in the medium with refractive index $n_2$.\n-   $i_2$: Angle of incidence in the medium $n_2$.\n-   $i_1$: Angle of refraction in the medium $n_1$.\n-   $R_s$: Total reflectance for s-polarized light.\n\nWe assume all media are non-magnetic, isotropic, and non-absorbing. The interfaces are perfectly smooth and parallel.\n\n### Step 1: Total Complex Reflection Amplitude\nThe total complex reflection amplitude, $\\rho$, for a thin film is the coherent sum of the amplitudes of all reflected rays. For a film (medium 1) between two semi-infinite media (incident medium 0 and transmission medium 2), this is given by the sum of a geometric series.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\rho = \\frac{r_{01} + r_{12} e^{j2\\delta}}{1 + r_{01}r_{12}e^{j2\\delta}} }\\]\nHere, $r_{01}$ and $r_{12}$ are the Fresnel reflection coefficients at the 0-1 and 1-2 interfaces, respectively, and $2\\delta$ is the round-trip phase shift within the film. In our case, medium 0 and 2 are the same ($n_2$), so $r_{01}$ corresponds to the $n_2 \\to n_1$ interface and $r_{12}$ to the $n_1 \\to n_2$ interface. For s-polarization, the Fresnel coefficients are related by $r_{12,s} = -r_{01,s}$. Let's denote $r_{01,s}$ as $r_s$. The total complex reflection amplitude for s-polarized light, $\\rho_s$, becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_s = \\frac{r_s + (-r_s) e^{j2\\delta}}{1 + r_s(-r_s)e^{j2\\delta}} = \\frac{r_s(1 - e^{j2\\delta})}{1 - r_s^2 e^{j2\\delta}}\n\\label{eq:rho_s} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Phase Term under TIR\nThe relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction is given by Snell's Law. The phase shift for a round trip inside the film depends on the optical path length.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{Snell's Law: } n_2 \\sin i_2 = n_1 \\sin i_1 }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{Phase Shift: } 2\\delta = \\frac{4\\pi n_1 d \\cos i_1}{\\lambda_0} }\\]\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the vacuum wavelength. Using $\\lambda = \\lambda_0/n_2$ and $n=n_1/n_2$, the phase shift is $2\\delta = \\frac{4\\pi n d \\cos i_1}{\\lambda}$.\nFrom Snell's Law, $\\sin i_1 = \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\sin i_2 = \\frac{\\sin i_2}{n}$. Since TIR occurs, $\\sin i_2 > n$, which implies $\\sin i_1 > 1$. This means $i_1$ is a complex angle, and its cosine is purely imaginary.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos i_1 = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 i_1} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\sin^2 i_2}{n^2}} = i\\frac{\\sqrt{\\sin^2 i_2 - n^2}}{n} \\label{eq:cos_i1} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe positive imaginary root is chosen, corresponding to a wave whose amplitude decays in the direction of propagation into the film. Substituting this into the phase shift expression, the term $j2\\delta$ becomes a real, negative quantity, representing attenuation rather than a propagating phase.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nj2\\delta = j \\left( \\frac{4\\pi n d}{\\lambda} \\right) \\left( i \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sin^2 i_2 - n^2}}{n} \\right) = - \\frac{4\\pi d}{\\lambda} \\sqrt{\\sin^2 i_2 - n^2} \\equiv -X \\label{eq:phase_shift} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe term $e^{j2\\delta}$ becomes a real exponential decay factor $e^{-X}$, where $X = \\frac{4\\pi d}{\\lambda} \\sqrt{\\sin^2 i_2 - n^2}$.\n\n### Step 3: General Expression for Reflectance R_s\nThe total reflectance $R_s$ is the squared magnitude of the complex reflection amplitude $\\rho_s$.\n\\[\\boxed{ R_s = |\\rho_s|^2 = \\rho_s \\rho_s^* }\\]\nUnder TIR, the Fresnel coefficient $r_s$ is complex but has a magnitude of 1, i.e., $|r_s|^2 = 1$. We can write it as $r_s = e^{-j\\phi_s}$, where $\\phi_s$ is the phase shift upon a single reflection. Substituting $e^{j2\\delta} = e^{-X}$ and $r_s = e^{-j\\phi_s}$ into Eq. \\eqref{eq:rho_s}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_s = \\frac{e^{-j\\phi_s}(1 - e^{-X})}{1 - (e^{-j\\phi_s})^2 e^{-X}} = \\frac{e^{-j\\phi_s}(1 - e^{-X})}{1 - e^{-2j\\phi_s} e^{-X}} \\label{eq:rho_s_ftir} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we calculate the reflectance $R_s$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nR_s &= |\\rho_s|^2 = \\left| \\frac{e^{-j\\phi_s}(1 - e^{-X})}{1 - e^{-X}e^{-2j\\phi_s}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{|e^{-j\\phi_s}|^2 (1 - e^{-X})^2}{|1 - e^{-X}e^{-2j\\phi_s}|^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{(1 - e^{-X})^2}{(1 - e^{-X}e^{-2j\\phi_s})(1 - e^{-X}e^{2j\\phi_s})} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{(1 - e^{-X})^2}{1 - e^{-X}(e^{2j\\phi_s} + e^{-2j\\phi_s}) + e^{-2X}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{(1 - e^{-X})^2}{1 - 2e^{-X}\\cos(2\\phi_s) + e^{-2X}} \\label{eq:Rs_intermediate} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplification of the Reflectance Expression\nTo simplify the expression for $R_s$, we use standard trigonometric and hyperbolic identities.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\cos(2A) = 1 - 2\\sin^2(A) }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\sinh(y) = \\frac{e^y - e^{-y}}{2} }\\]\nFirst, we rewrite the denominator of Eq. \\eqref{eq:Rs_intermediate} using the identity for $\\cos(2\\phi_s)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n1 - 2e^{-X}\\cos(2\\phi_s) + e^{-2X} &= 1 - 2e^{-X}(1 - 2\\sin^2(\\phi_s)) + e^{-2X} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (1 - 2e^{-X} + e^{-2X}) + 4e^{-X}\\sin^2(\\phi_s) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (1 - e^{-X})^2 + 4e^{-X}\\sin^2(\\phi_s) \\label{eq:denom_simplified} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting this back into Eq. \\eqref{eq:Rs_intermediate} gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nR_s = \\frac{(1 - e^{-X})^2}{(1 - e^{-X})^2 + 4e^{-X}\\sin^2(\\phi_s)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{4e^{-X}\\sin^2(\\phi_s)}{(1 - e^{-X})^2}} \\label{eq:Rs_almost_simple} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we use the hyperbolic sine definition to simplify the fraction in the denominator.

We align the z-axis with the pipe's central axis, so the flow is purely in the z-direction and the velocity profile $v_z$ depends only on the transverse coordinates $(x, y)$.\n4.  **Incompressible Fluid**: The density $\\rho$ is constant, as stated in the problem.\n5.  **No-Slip Boundary Condition**: The fluid velocity is zero at the pipe walls.\n\n### Step 1: Simplification of the Navier-Stokes Equation\nWe simplify the general Navier-Stokes equation based on the assumptions for fully developed laminar flow in a straight pipe.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe motion of an incompressible viscous fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\vec{v} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p + \\frac{\\eta}{\\rho} \\Delta \\vec{v}}\\]\nFor steady flow, all time derivatives are zero.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\cdot) = 0}\\]\nFor fully developed laminar flow in a straight pipe along the z-axis, the velocity vector has only a z-component which depends only on the transverse coordinates (x, y).\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{v} = v_z(x, y) \\hat{k}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nApplying the assumptions to the Navier-Stokes equation:\n1.  The steady flow assumption ($\\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial t} = 0$) eliminates the time derivative term.\n2.  The fully developed flow assumption ($\\vec{v} = v_z(x,y)\\hat{k}$) simplifies the convective acceleration term:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\vec{v} = \\left(v_z \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) (v_z(x,y)\\hat{k}) = v_z \\frac{\\partial v_z(x,y)}{\\partial z} \\hat{k} = 0\n    \\end{align}\\]\nThe Navier-Stokes equation reduces to:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n0 = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p + \\frac{\\eta}{\\rho} \\Delta \\vec{v} \\implies \\nabla p = \\eta \\Delta \\vec{v}\n\\label{eq:ns_simplified_vec} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nWriting this vector equation in Cartesian components, with $\\vec{v} = (0, 0, v_z(x,y))$:\n-   x-component: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\eta \\Delta(0) = 0$\n-   y-component: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = \\eta \\Delta(0) = 0$\nThese imply that the pressure $p$ is a function of $z$ only, i.e., $p=p(z)$.\n-   z-component: $\\frac{dp}{dz} = \\eta \\Delta v_z = \\eta \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right)$. Since $v_z$ only depends on $x$ and $y$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} = 0$.\nSo, the z-component equation is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dp}{dz} = \\eta \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial y^2} \\right)\n\\label{eq:ns_simplified_z} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn eq. \\eqref{eq:ns_simplified_z}, the left side depends only on $z$, while the right side depends only on $(x,y)$. For this equality to hold for all $(x,y,z)$, both sides must be equal to the same constant. This means the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dz}$ is constant. For a pipe of length $l$ with a pressure drop $\\Delta p = p(0) - p(l)$, this constant is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dp}{dz} = \\frac{p(l) - p(0)}{l} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{l}\n\\label{eq:pressure_gradient} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting this into eq. \\eqref{eq:ns_simplified_z} gives a Poisson equation for the velocity profile $v_z(x,y)$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\right) v_z = \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\eta l}\n\\label{eq:poisson} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System and Boundary Definition\nTo solve the Poisson equation over the triangular cross-section, we define a coordinate system and the equations for the boundary.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe boundary of the domain is defined by the three lines forming the sides of the triangle. The general equation of a line in a plane is:\n\\[\\boxed{Ax + By + C = 0}\\]\nThe no-slip boundary condition states that the fluid velocity is zero at the solid walls of the pipe.\n\\[\\boxed{v_z(x, y) = 0 \\quad \\text{for (x,y) on the boundary}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nWe place the origin $(0,0)$ at the centroid of the equilateral triangle cross-section. The height of the triangle is $H = a\\sqrt{3}/2$. The vertices are located at:\n-   $V_1 = (0, \\frac{2}{3}H) = (0, a/\\sqrt{3})$\n-   $V_2 = (a/2, -\\frac{1}{3}H) = (a/2, -a/(2\\sqrt{3}))$\n-   $V_3 = (-a/2, -\\frac{1}{3}H) = (-a/2, -a/(2\\sqrt{3}))$\n\nThe equations for the three lines forming the sides of the triangle are:\n1.  Bottom side (connecting $V_2$ and $V_3$): This is a horizontal line at $y = -a/(2\\sqrt{3})$.\n    \\[\\begin{align} L_1 \\equiv y + \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}} = 0 \\label{eq:L1} \\tag{5a} \\end{align}\\]\n2.  Right side (connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$): The slope is $m = \\frac{a/\\sqrt{3} - (-a/(2\\sqrt{3}))}{0 - a/2} = -\\sqrt{3}$. Using the point-slope form with $V_1$: $y - a/\\sqrt{3} = -\\sqrt{3}(x-0)$.\n    \\[\\begin{align} L_2 \\equiv y + \\sqrt{3}x - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} = 0 \\label{eq:L2} \\tag{5b} \\end{align}\\]\n3.  Left side (connecting $V_1$ and $V_3$): The slope is $m = \\frac{a/\\sqrt{3} - (-a/(2\\sqrt{3}))}{0 - (-a/2)} = \\sqrt{3}$. Using the point-slope form with $V_1$: $y - a/\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{3}(x-0)$.\n    \\[\\begin{align} L_3 \\equiv y - \\sqrt{3}x - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} = 0 \\label{eq:L3} \\tag{5c} \\end{align}\\]\nThe no-slip boundary condition requires $v_z(x,y)=0$ on these three lines.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Velocity Profile\nWe propose a solution for $v_z(x,y)$ that satisfies the boundary conditions by construction and then solve for the unknown constant by substituting it into the Poisson equation.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nA common method for solving this type of problem is to construct a solution that is zero on the boundaries. We propose a solution proportional to the product of the linear functions defining the boundary lines.\n\\[\\boxed{v_z(x,y) = C \\cdot L_1(x,y) \\cdot L_2(x,y) \\cdot L_3(x,y)}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe velocity profile is constructed as the product of the boundary line equations:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_z(x,y) &= C \\left(y + \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\left(y + \\sqrt{3}x - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\left(y - \\sqrt{3}x - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= C \\left(y + \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\left[ \\left(y - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 - (\\sqrt{3}x)^2 \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= C \\left(y + \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\left( y^2 - \\frac{2a}{\\sqrt{3}}y + \\frac{a^2}{3} - 3x^2 \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= C \\left( y^3 - \\frac{3a}{2\\sqrt{3}}y^2 - 3x^2y - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{2}x^2 + \\frac{a^3}{6\\sqrt{3}} \\right) \\label{eq:vz_expanded} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow, we compute the Laplacian $\\Delta v_z = \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial y^2}$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial x} &= C \\left( -6xy - \\sqrt{3}ax \\right) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial x^2} = C \\left( -6y - \\sqrt{3}a \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial y} &= C \\left( 3y^2 - \\frac{3a}{\\sqrt{3}}y - 3x^2 \\right) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial y^2} = C \\left( 6y - \\frac{3a}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right) = C \\left( 6y - \\sqrt{3}a \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\Delta v_z &= \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial y^2} = C(-6y - \\sqrt{3}a) + C(6y - \\sqrt{3}a) = -2\\sqrt{3}aC\n\\label{eq:laplacian_vz} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis result is a constant, which is consistent with the Poisson equation \\eqref{eq:poisson}. Equating the two expressions for the Laplacian:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n-2\\sqrt{3}aC = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\eta l} \\implies C = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\sqrt{3}a\\eta l}\n\\label{eq:constant_C} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\\]\nWith this value of $C$, the velocity profile $v_z(x,y)$ is uniquely determined.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Volumetric Flow Rate\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A$ of the triangle.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe volumetric flow rate is the total volume of fluid passing through a cross-section per unit time.\n\\[\\boxed{Q = \\iint_A v_z(x,y) \\,dA}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nWe integrate the velocity profile $v_z(x,y)$ over the triangular area $A$.

The setup is in a zero-gravity, charge-free space. The common vertex of the cones is at the origin of a coordinate system.\n\nThe geometry of the problem is described by the cone surfaces. It is most convenient to use a spherical coordinate system $(R, \\alpha, \\phi)$, where $R$ is the radial distance from the origin, $\\alpha$ is the polar angle measured from the positive z-axis, and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. The problem provides the cone equations in cylindrical coordinates $(r, z)$:\n-   Cone A: $r = z \\tan\\alpha_{1}$\n-   Cone B: $r = z \\tan\\alpha_{2}$\nwith the condition $\\alpha_{2} > \\alpha_{1}$.\n\nThe relationship between cylindrical and spherical coordinates is $r = R\\sin\\alpha$ and $z = R\\cos\\alpha$. Substituting these into the cone equations gives $\\frac{r}{z} = \\frac{R\\sin\\alpha}{R\\cos\\alpha} = \\tan\\alpha$. Thus, the cone surfaces correspond to surfaces of constant polar angle:\n-   Cone A is the surface $\\alpha = \\alpha_1$.\n-   Cone B is the surface $\\alpha = \\alpha_2$.\n\nThe electric potential $V$ has the following boundary conditions:\n-   On cone A (at $\\alpha = \\alpha_1$): $V_A = V(\\alpha_1) = 0$.\n-   On cone B (at $\\alpha = \\alpha_2$): $V_B = V(\\alpha_2) = V_0$.\n\nWe make the following assumptions:\n1.  The region between the cones is a vacuum and contains no free electric charges.\n2.  The cones are perfect conductors, so their surfaces are equipotentials.\n3.  The cones extend infinitely from the origin.\n\nThe goal is to find the potential $V$ as a function of position. The problem statement suggests the solution will be a function of the polar angle, $V(\\alpha)$, which we will confirm through symmetry analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate Laplace's Equation in Spherical Coordinates\nIn a region of space with no electric charge, the electric potential $V$ satisfies Laplace's equation.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\nabla^2 V = 0}\n\\]\nGiven the conical symmetry of the problem, it is most convenient to work in spherical coordinates $(R, \\alpha, \\phi)$. The expression for the Laplacian operator in these coordinates is a standard result:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{R^{2}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}\\left(R^{2}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial R}\\right)+\\frac{1}{R^{2}\\sin\\alpha}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha}\\left(\\sin\\alpha\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\alpha}\\right)+\\frac{1}{R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\alpha}\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial\\phi^{2}}}\n\\]\nApplying the Laplace equation principle to a potential $V(R, \\alpha, \\phi)$ gives the partial differential equation that must be solved in the region between the cones:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{R^{2}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}\\left(R^{2}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial R}\\right)+\\frac{1}{R^{2}\\sin\\alpha}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha}\\left(\\sin\\alpha\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\alpha}\\right)+\\frac{1}{R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\alpha}\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial\\phi^{2}} = 0\n\\label{eq:laplace_full} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify Laplace's Equation Using Symmetry\nThe geometry of the problem and the boundary conditions possess certain symmetries that simplify the problem. We can assume the potential $V$ depends only on the polar angle $\\alpha$.\n\\[\n\\boxed{V(R, \\alpha, \\phi) = V(\\alpha)}\n\\]\nThis assumption is justified by the following arguments:\n1.  **Azimuthal Symmetry:** The cones are coaxial about the z-axis, and the boundary potentials are constant on each cone. The system is therefore symmetric under rotations about the z-axis (i.e., changes in the azimuthal angle $\\phi$). Thus, the potential cannot depend on $\\phi$, which means $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$.\n2.  **Scale Invariance:** The cones extend infinitely from the origin. There is no characteristic length scale associated with the radial distance $R$. The boundary conditions are specified on surfaces of constant $\\alpha$, independent of $R$. This scale invariance implies that the form of the solution cannot depend on $R$. Thus, the potential cannot depend on $R$, which means $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial R} = 0$.\n\nApplying these conditions, the partial derivatives with respect to $R$ and $\\phi$ in Laplace's equation (eq. \\ref{eq:laplace_full}) are zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial R} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\phi} = 0\n\\label{eq:symmetry_derivs} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting these into eq. \\ref{eq:laplace_full}, the first and third terms vanish. Since $V$ is now a function of $\\alpha$ only, the partial derivatives with respect to $\\alpha$ become ordinary derivatives.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{R^{2}\\sin\\alpha}\\frac{d}{d\\alpha}\\left(\\sin\\alpha\\frac{d V}{d\\alpha}\\right) = 0\n\\label{eq:laplace_simplified_1} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor this equation to hold for any $R \\neq 0$ and for $\\alpha$ in the range $(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2)$ (where $\\sin\\alpha \\neq 0$), the term in the derivative must be zero.

The trap is formed by two identical, uniformly charged rings.\n\nThe given physical parameters are:\n*   **Rings**: Each ring has a radius $R$ and a total charge $Q_0$. They are located on the planes $z=l$ and $z=-l$, centered on the z-axis. We assume $Q_0 > 0$ to create a confining potential for a negative charge.\n*   **Particle**: A point particle with mass $m$ and charge $-q$ (where $q$ is a positive magnitude).\n*   **Constants**: The permittivity of vacuum is $\\varepsilon_0$.\n\nThe particle is initially at rest at the origin $(0,0,0)$, which is a point of equilibrium. We are interested in its motion when it is slightly displaced along the z-axis. This is a \"perturbation stability\" problem, which means we will analyze the conditions for stable oscillations and then determine their frequency.\n\nWe will make the following assumptions:\n1.  The displacement $z$ from the origin is small, i.e., $|z| \\ll l$ and $|z| \\ll R$.\n2.  The problem is treated within the framework of classical mechanics and electrostatics. Relativistic effects and delayed potentials are ignored.\n\n### Step 1: Total Electric Field on the z-axis\nFirst, we determine the net electric field along the z-axis created by the two rings. The electric field on the axis of a single ring of charge $Q_0$ and radius $R$, centered at $z=z_0$, is directed along the z-axis.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ E_{z, \\text{ring}}(z) = \\frac{Q_0 (z-z_0)}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 [R^2 + (z-z_0)^2]^{3/2}} }\\]\nThe total electric field is the vector sum of the fields from all sources. By the principle of superposition:\n\\[\\boxed{ \\vec{E}_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i \\vec{E}_i }\\]\nDue to the symmetry of the setup, the net electric field on the z-axis will only have a z-component, $E_z(z)$. We sum the contributions from the two rings:\n*   The ring at $z_0 = l$ produces a field: $E_{z,1}(z) = \\frac{Q_0(z-l)}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 [R^2 + (z-l)^2]^{3/2}}$.\n*   The ring at $z_0 = -l$ produces a field: $E_{z,2}(z) = \\frac{Q_0(z-(-l))}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 [R^2 + (z+l)^2]^{3/2}}$.\n\nThe total electric field at a position $z$ on the axis is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_z(z) &= E_{z,1}(z) + E_{z,2}(z) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{z-l}{[R^2 + (z-l)^2]^{3/2}} + \\frac{z+l}{[R^2 + (z+l)^2]^{3/2}} \\right) \\label{eq:Ez_exact} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAt the origin ($z=0$), the field is $E_z(0) = \\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{-l}{(R^2 + l^2)^{3/2}} + \\frac{l}{(R^2 + l^2)^{3/2}} \\right) = 0$. This confirms that the origin is an equilibrium position, as the net force there is zero.\n\n### Step 2: Linear Approximation of the Electric Field\nFor small displacements $z$ from the origin, the electric field can be approximated by the first-order term of its Taylor series expansion around $z=0$.\n\\[\\boxed{ f(z) \\approx f(0) + f'(0)z }\\]\nSince $E_z(0)=0$, the approximation is $E_z(z) \\approx E_z'(0)z$. We need to compute the derivative of $E_z(z)$ with respect to $z$ and evaluate it at $z=0$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{z-z_0}{[R^2+(z-z_0)^2]^{3/2}}\\right) = \\frac{R^2-2(z-z_0)^2}{[R^2+(z-z_0)^2]^{5/2}} \\label{eq:deriv_single_ring} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nApplying this to our total field expression from Eq. \\eqref{eq:Ez_exact}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_z'(z) = \\frac{dE_z}{dz} = \\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{R^2 - 2(z-l)^2}{[R^2 + (z-l)^2]^{5/2}} + \\frac{R^2 - 2(z+l)^2}{[R^2 + (z+l)^2]^{5/2}} \\right) \\label{eq:Ez_deriv} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the equilibrium point $z=0$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_z'(0) &= \\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{R^2 - 2(-l)^2}{[R^2 + (-l)^2]^{5/2}} + \\frac{R^2 - 2(l)^2}{[R^2 + (l)^2]^{5/2}} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{R^2 - 2l^2}{(R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}} + \\frac{R^2 - 2l^2}{(R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{Q_0}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{R^2 - 2l^2}{(R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}} \\label{eq:Ez_deriv_at_0} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, for small $z$, the electric field is approximately linear:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_z(z) \\approx \\left( \\frac{Q_0(R^2 - 2l^2)}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0 (R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}} \\right) z \\label{eq:Ez_linear} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Equation of Motion and Stability Condition\nWe apply Newton's Second Law to the particle of mass $m$ and charge $-q$. The electric force provides the net force in the z-direction.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\vec{F}_e = (-q)\\vec{E} }\\]\nThe equation of motion in the z-direction is $m\\ddot{z} = F_z = (-q)E_z(z)$. Using the linear approximation for $E_z(z)$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:Ez_linear}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm\\ddot{z} \\approx (-q) \\left[ \\frac{Q_0(R^2 - 2l^2)}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0 (R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}} \\right] z \\label{eq:EOM} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor stable oscillations (Simple Harmonic Motion, SHM), the force must be a restoring force, directed opposite to the displacement. The equation of motion for SHM has the standard form:\n\\[\\boxed{ m\\ddot{z} + k z = 0, \\quad \\text{where } k > 0 }\\]\nHere, $k$ is the effective spring constant, which must be positive for stability. Comparing our equation of motion, Eq. \\eqref{eq:EOM}, with the standard SHM form, we can identify $k$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk = q \\left[ \\frac{Q_0(R^2 - 2l^2)}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0 (R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}} \\right] \\label{eq:k} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe condition for stability is $k > 0$. Since $q, Q_0, \\varepsilon_0$ are all positive, and the denominator is always positive, the stability condition simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nR^2 - 2l^2 > 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad R^2 > 2l^2 \\label{eq:stability} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis geometric constraint ensures that the equilibrium at the origin is stable.\n\n### Step 4: Angular Frequency of Oscillation\nThe angular frequency $\\omega_z$ of an SHM is determined by the spring constant $k$ and the mass $m$.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} }\\]\nSubstituting our expression for the effective spring constant $k$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:k} into this formula:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_z^2 &= \\frac{k}{m} = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\frac{q Q_0(R^2 - 2l^2)}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0 (R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega_z &= \\sqrt{\\frac{q Q_0(R^2 - 2l^2)}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_0 m (R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}}} \\label{eq:omega_final} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe stability condition $R^2 > 2l^2$ ensures that the term under the square root is positive, so $\\omega_z$ is a real frequency.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angular frequency $\\omega_z$ corresponding to the perturbation stability of the particle in the $\\hat{z}$ direction is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\omega_{z}=\\sqrt{\\frac{q Q_{0}(R^{2}-2l^{2})}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}m(R^{2}+l^{2})^{\\frac{5}{2}}}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis result is valid only under the condition for stable equilibrium, which is $R^2 > 2l^2$."}

The free surface charge density is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_f(\\theta) &= \\hat{r} \\cdot (\\vec{D}_{\\text{out}} - 0)|_{r=R} = D_{\\text{out},r}|_{r=R} = \\varepsilon E_{\\text{out},r}|_{r=R}\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing the result for $E_{\\text{out},r}(R, \\theta)$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:E_out_R} and $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_f(\\theta) = \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\left( 3E_0 \\cos\\theta + \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r R^2} \\right) = 3\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r E_0 \\cos\\theta + \\frac{Q}{4\\pi R^2} \\label{eq:sigma_f}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Electrostatic Force on the Conductor\nThe total electrostatic force on the conductor is the integral of the force on each element of free charge $dq_f = \\sigma_f dS$.\n\n#### Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions\nThe force on a surface charge element $dq_f$ is the product of the charge and the local electric field produced by all other sources, $\\vec{E}_{\\text{other}}$. This field excludes the singular field of the charge element itself.\n\\[\\boxed{\nd\\vec{F} = \\vec{E}_{\\text{other}} dq_f\n}\\]\nFor a charge layer on a conductor surface, this effective field is the average of the fields on either side of the surface:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\vec{E}_{\\text{other}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{E}_{\\text{out}} + \\vec{E}_{\\text{in}})\n}\\]\nThe total force is the integral over the conductor's surface:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\vec{F} = \\int_S d\\vec{F}\n}\\]\n\n#### Derivation\nSince $\\vec{E}_{\\text{in}} = 0$ inside the conductor, the effective field is $\\vec{E}_{\\text{other}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{E}_{\\text{out}}$. The force element is $d\\vec{F} = \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{E}_{\\text{out}}(R, \\theta) \\sigma_f(\\theta) dS$. At the surface $r=R$, the field is purely radial: $\\vec{E}_{\\text{out}}(R, \\theta) = E_{\\text{out},\\perp}(R, \\theta) \\hat{r}$. The surface element is $dS = R^2 \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi$. Due to the symmetry of the setup, the net force will be along the direction of $\\vec{E}_0$, which is the $\\hat{z}$-direction. We calculate the $z$-component of the force, $F_z = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\hat{z}$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\ndF_z &= (d\\vec{F}) \\cdot \\hat{z} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{out},\\perp} \\sigma_f dS \\hat{r} \\right) \\cdot \\hat{z} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{out},\\perp} \\sigma_f (\\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{z}) dS\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing $\\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{z} = \\cos\\theta$, and integrating over the surface:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF_z &= \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{out},\\perp}(R, \\theta) \\sigma_f(\\theta) \\cos\\theta R^2 \\sin\\theta d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\pi R^2 \\int_0^{\\pi} E_{\\text{out},\\perp}(R, \\theta) \\sigma_f(\\theta) \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta d\\theta\n\\end{align}\\]\nLet's expand the product $E_{\\text{out},\\perp} \\sigma_f$ using Eq. \\eqref{eq:E_out_R} and Eq. \\eqref{eq:sigma_f}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nE_{\\text{out},\\perp} \\sigma_f &= \\left(3E_0 \\cos\\theta + \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r R^2}\\right) \\left(3\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r E_0 \\cos\\theta + \\frac{Q}{4\\pi R^2}\\right) \\\\\n&= 9\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r E_0^2 \\cos^2\\theta + \\frac{3E_0 Q \\cos\\theta}{4\\pi R^2} + \\frac{3\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r E_0 Q \\cos\\theta}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r R^2} + \\frac{Q^2}{16\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r R^4} \\\\\n&= 9\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r E_0^2 \\cos^2\\theta + \\frac{3E_0 Q \\cos\\theta}{2\\pi R^2} + \\frac{Q^2}{16\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r R^4} \\label{eq:product_expansion}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow we substitute this back into the integral for $F_z$. The full integrand, multiplied by $\\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta$, becomes:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left( 9\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r E_0^2 \\cos^3\\theta \\sin\\theta + \\frac{3E_0 Q}{2\\pi R^2} \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta + \\frac{Q^2}{16\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r R^4} \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\right)\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow we integrate each term from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^\\pi \\cos^3\\theta \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta &= \\left[-\\frac{\\cos^4\\theta}{4}\\right]_0^\\pi = 0 \\\\\n\\int_0^\\pi \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta &= \\left[-\\frac{\\cos^3\\theta}{3}\\right]_0^\\pi = \\frac{2}{3} \\\\\n\\int_0^\\pi \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta &= \\left[\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{2}\\right]_0^\\pi = 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nOnly the middle term of the integrand gives a non-zero contribution to the total force.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF_z &= \\pi R^2 \\int_0^\\pi \\left( \\frac{3E_0 Q}{2\\pi R^2} \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta \\right) d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\pi R^2 \\left( \\frac{3E_0 Q}{2\\pi R^2} \\int_0^\\pi \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta \\right) \\\\\n&= \\pi R^2 \\left( \\frac{3E_0 Q}{2\\pi R^2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\pi R^2 \\left( \\frac{E_0 Q}{\\pi R^2} \\right) = Q E_0 \\label{eq:Fz_result}\n\\end{align}\\]\nBy symmetry, the net force is entirely in the z-direction, so the force vector is $\\vec{F} = F_z \\hat{z} = Q E_0 \\hat{z} = Q\\vec{E}_0$. The magnitude of the force is the magnitude of this vector.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF = |\\vec{F}| = |Q \\vec{E}_0| = |Q| |\\vec{E}_0| = |Q| E_0 \\label{eq:F_mag}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis result is remarkably simple and independent of the dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_r$ and the sphere's radius $R$. It shows that the net force on the charged sphere is identical to the force that would be exerted on a point charge $Q$ placed in the uniform external field $\\vec{E}_0$. The complex interactions involving the induced dipole moment of the sphere and the polarization of the dielectric medium result in a set of forces that have a zero net sum. The only term that yields a net force is the interaction between the sphere's total free charge $Q$ and the external field $\\vec{E}_0$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe magnitude of the electrostatic force $F$ acting on the conducting sphere is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{F = |Q| E_0}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The central charge is now `-Q`.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe same principles as in Step 1 apply.\n\n**Derivation:**\nAt position B, the radius is `r_B = L/2`, the angular velocity is `ω_B`, and the central charge is `-Q`.\n\n1.  **Spring Force (`F_{s,B}`):** The spring's extension is `\\Delta x_B = r_B - L_0 = L/2 - L/4 = L/4`. The stretched spring pulls the ball inward (positive direction).\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    F_{s,B} = k_s \\left(\\frac{L}{4}\\right)\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n2.  **Electrostatic Force (`F_{e,B}`):** The central charge `-Q` and the ball's charge `+q` are opposite charges, resulting in an attractive force directed inward (positive direction).\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    F_{e,B} = +\\frac{k q Q}{r_B^2} = +\\frac{k q Q}{(L/2)^2} = +\\frac{4 k q Q}{L^2}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n3.  **Equation of Motion:** The net radial force provides the centripetal force, `m a_c = m r_B \\omega_B^2 = m (L/2) \\omega_B^2`.\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\sum F_{\\text{radial}} &= m a_c \\nonumber \\\\\n    F_{s,B} + F_{e,B} &= m \\frac{L}{2} \\omega_B^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n    k_s \\frac{L}{4} + \\frac{4 k q Q}{L^2} &= m \\frac{L}{2} \\omega_B^2\n    \\label{eq:state_B} \\tag{2}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n### Step 3: Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum\nThe transition from State A to State B occurs after the external torque is removed. We analyze the angular momentum of the system.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d\\vec{J}_{\\text{system}}}{dt} = \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{net, ext}} \\quad (\\text{Rotational form of Newton's Second Law})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{If } \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{net, ext}} = 0, \\text{ then } \\vec{J}_{\\text{system}} = \\text{constant} \\quad (\\text{Conservation of Angular Momentum})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{J_{\\text{system}} = J_{\\text{ball}} + J_{\\text{tube}} = (mr^2 + I_{\\text{tube}})\\omega \\quad (\\text{Total angular momentum of the system})}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe problem states that after the ball reaches position A, the external torque on the system becomes zero. The system consists of the rotating tube and the ball. The forces between the tube and the ball are internal to the system. Since the net external torque on the system is zero, the total angular momentum of the system is conserved during the transition from state A to state B.\n\nThe total angular momentum of the system is the sum of the angular momentum of the ball (`J_ball`) and the tube (`J_tube`).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nJ_{\\text{system}} = J_{\\text{ball}} + J_{\\text{tube}} = (m r^2) \\omega + I_{\\text{tube}} \\omega = (m r^2 + I_{\\text{tube}}) \\omega\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe problem specifies that the tube is \"lightweight,\" which implies its moment of inertia `I_tube` is negligible. We therefore make the standard assumption that `I_tube = 0`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nJ_{\\text{system}} \\approx J_{\\text{ball}} = m r^2 \\omega\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince the total angular momentum is conserved, the ball's angular momentum is conserved. We equate the angular momentum in state A (radius `r_A=L`, angular velocity `ω`) to that in state B (radius `r_B=L/2`, angular velocity `ω_B`).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nJ_A &= J_B \\nonumber \\\\\nm r_A^2 \\omega &= m r_B^2 \\omega_B \\nonumber \\\\\nm L^2 \\omega &= m \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2 \\omega_B \\nonumber \\\\\nm L^2 \\omega &= m \\frac{L^2}{4} \\omega_B \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega &= \\frac{1}{4} \\omega_B\n\\label{eq:ang_mom} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve the System of Equations\nWe now have a system of three equations (\\ref{eq:state_A}, \\ref{eq:state_B}, \\ref{eq:ang_mom}) with three unknowns (`k_s`, `ω`, `ω_B`). We solve this system for `ω_B`.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThis step involves algebraic manipulation of the equations derived from physical principles in the previous steps.\n\n**Derivation:**\nFirst, substitute `ω` from Eq. (\\ref{eq:ang_mom}) into Eq. (\\ref{eq:state_A}) to eliminate `ω`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk_s \\frac{3L}{4} - \\frac{k q Q}{L^2} &= m L \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\omega_B\\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\nk_s \\frac{3L}{4} - \\frac{k q Q}{L^2} &= \\frac{1}{16} m L \\omega_B^2\n\\label{eq:mod_A} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we have a system of two equations, (\\ref{eq:state_B}) and (\\ref{eq:mod_A}), with two unknowns, `k_s` and `ω_B`. We proceed to eliminate `k_s`. From Eq. (\\ref{eq:state_B}), we express the term `k_s (L/4)`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk_s \\frac{L}{4} = m \\frac{L}{2} \\omega_B^2 - \\frac{4 k q Q}{L^2}\n\\label{eq:ks_term_1} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo use this in Eq. (\\ref{eq:mod_A}), we multiply Eq. (\\ref{eq:ks_term_1}) by 3:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n3 \\left(k_s \\frac{L}{4}\\right) &= 3 \\left(m \\frac{L}{2} \\omega_B^2 - \\frac{4 k q Q}{L^2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\nk_s \\frac{3L}{4} &= \\frac{3}{2} m L \\omega_B^2 - \\frac{12 k q Q}{L^2}\n\\label{eq:ks_term_2} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, substitute this expression for `k_s (3L/4)` into Eq. (\\ref{eq:mod_A}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{3}{2} m L \\omega_B^2 - \\frac{12 k q Q}{L^2}\\right) - \\frac{k q Q}{L^2} &= \\frac{1}{16} m L \\omega_B^2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we solve for `ω_B^2`. Group terms containing `ω_B^2` on the left side and all other terms on the right side.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{3}{2} m L \\omega_B^2 - \\frac{1}{16} m L \\omega_B^2 &= \\frac{12 k q Q}{L^2} + \\frac{k q Q}{L^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{16}\\right) m L \\omega_B^2 &= \\frac{13 k q Q}{L^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{24}{16} - \\frac{1}{16}\\right) m L \\omega_B^2 &= \\frac{13 k q Q}{L^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{23}{16} m L \\omega_B^2 &= \\frac{13 k q Q}{L^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega_B^2 &= \\frac{13 k q Q}{L^2} \\cdot \\frac{16}{23 m L} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega_B^2 &= \\frac{208 k q Q}{23 m L^3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFinally, take the square root to find the magnitude of `ω_B`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_B &= \\sqrt{\\frac{208 k q Q}{23 m L^3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16 \\cdot 13 \\cdot k q Q}{23 m L^3}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega_B &= 4 \\sqrt{\\frac{13 k q Q}{23 m L^3}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe rotational speed `ω_B` of the thin tube when the ball is at the equilibrium point B is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\omega_B = 4 \\sqrt{\\frac{13 k q Q}{23 m L^3}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The network consists of nodes labeled by integers $n \\in \\{\\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. All thermal resistances in the network have an identical value of $R$.\n\nThe connections between the nodes are defined by two rules:\n1.  Every node $n$ is connected to its nearest neighbors, $n-1$ and $n+1$, by a thermal resistance $R$. This forms an infinite 1D chain.\n2.  An additional connection with thermal resistance $R$ exists between an even-numbered node $m$ and an odd-numbered node $n$ if they satisfy the relation $n = m+3$.\n\nFrom these rules, we can determine the three connections for any given node:\n*   An **even node** $m$ is connected to nodes $m-1$ and $m+1$ (from rule 1). Since $m$ is even, $m+3$ is odd, so rule 2 provides a connection to node $m+3$. Thus, an even node $m$ is connected to nodes $m-1, m+1, m+3$.\n*   An **odd node** $n$ is connected to nodes $n-1$ and $n+1$ (from rule 1). For the third connection, we seek an even node $m$ such that $n=m+3$, which implies $m=n-3$. Thus, an odd node $n$ is connected to nodes $n-3, n-1, n+1$.\n\nTo find the equivalent resistance $R_{04}$, we consider a scenario where a heat current $I$ is injected into node 0 and the same current $I$ is extracted from node 4. All other nodes in the network are assumed to be adiabatic, meaning there is no net heat flow into or out of them. Let $T_n$ be the temperature of node $n$. The equivalent resistance is then given by the ratio of the temperature difference between nodes 0 and 4 to the heat current.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nR_{04} = \\frac{T_0 - T_4}{I}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Formulating the Mathematical Model\nTo analyze the network, we separate the nodes into two sub-lattices: one for even-numbered nodes and one for odd-numbered nodes. We define the temperature of an even node $2k$ as $E_k = T_{2k}$ and the temperature of an odd node $2k+1$ as $O_k = T_{2k+1}$.\n\nThe physical principle governing the temperature distribution in the steady state is the conservation of energy. For heat flow, this is analogous to Kirchhoff's current law, which states that the net heat flow out of any adiabatic node is zero.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\sum_{j} I_{n \\to j} = \\sum_{j} \\frac{T_n - T_j}{R} = 0\n}\\]\nFor a node $n$ with three neighbors $j_1, j_2, j_3$, this simplifies to $3T_n = T_{j_1} + T_{j_2} + T_{j_3}$. We apply this to our two types of adiabatic nodes.\n\n1.  **Adiabatic Even Node ($m=2k$, where $2k \\neq 0, 4$):** The neighbors are $2k-1, 2k+1, 2k+3$. Their temperatures are $T_{2k-1}=O_{k-1}$, $T_{2k+1}=O_k$, and $T_{2k+3}=O_{k+1}$. The heat balance equation is:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    3E_k = O_{k-1} + O_k + O_{k+1} \\quad (\\text{for } k \\neq 0, 2) \\label{eq:even_node} \\tag{1}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n2.  **Adiabatic Odd Node ($n=2k+1$):** The neighbors are $2k-2, 2k, 2k+2$. Their temperatures are $T_{2k-2}=E_{k-1}$, $T_{2k}=E_k$, and $T_{2k+2}=E_{k+1}$. Since all odd nodes are adiabatic, this equation holds for all integers $k$.\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    3O_k = E_{k-1} + E_k + E_{k+1} \\quad (\\text{for all } k) \\label{eq:odd_node} \\tag{2}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n### Step 2: Finding the General Solution for the Temperature Field\nWe solve the system of coupled linear homogeneous difference equations derived in Step 1.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\begin{cases} 3E_k = O_{k-1} + O_k + O_{k+1} \\\\ 3O_k = E_{k-1} + E_k + E_{k+1} \\end{cases}\n}\\]\nWe seek exponential solutions (ansatz) of the form $E_k = A\\lambda^k$ and $O_k = B\\lambda^k$.\n\\[\\boxed{\nE_k = A\\lambda^k, \\quad O_k = B\\lambda^k\n}\\]\nSubstituting this ansatz into the system gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n3A\\lambda^k &= B\\lambda^{k-1} + B\\lambda^k + B\\lambda^{k+1} = B\\lambda^k(\\lambda^{-1}+1+\\lambda) \\implies 3A = B(\\lambda^{-1}+1+\\lambda) \\label{eq:ansatz1} \\tag{3} \\\\\n3B\\lambda^k &= A\\lambda^{k-1} + A\\lambda^k + A\\lambda^{k+1} = A\\lambda^k(\\lambda^{-1}+1+\\lambda) \\implies 3B = A(\\lambda^{-1}+1+\\lambda) \\label{eq:ansatz2} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor a non-trivial solution ($A, B \\neq 0$), we multiply the two equations to get $9AB = AB(\\lambda^{-1}+1+\\lambda)^2$, which leads to the characteristic equation for $\\lambda$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\lambda^{-1}+1+\\lambda)^2 = 9 \\implies \\lambda+\\lambda^{-1}+1 = \\pm 3\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe have two cases for $x = \\lambda+\\lambda^{-1}$:\n*   **Case 1:** $x+1=3 \\implies x=2 \\implies \\lambda+\\lambda^{-1}=2 \\implies \\lambda^2-2\\lambda+1=0 \\implies \\lambda=1$ (a double root). For this case, from Eq. \\eqref{eq:ansatz1}, $3A=B(2+1) \\implies A=B$.\n*   **Case 2:** $x+1=-3 \\implies x=-4 \\implies \\lambda+\\lambda^{-1}=-4 \\implies \\lambda^2+4\\lambda+1=0$. The roots are $\\lambda = -2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$. For this case, $3A=B(-4+1) \\implies A=-B$.\n\nLet's denote the roots as $\\alpha = -2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\beta = -2-\\sqrt{3}$. Note that $|\\alpha|<1$, $|\\beta|>1$, and $\\alpha\\beta=1$. The general solution is a linear combination of the basis solutions. The double root at $\\lambda=1$ introduces a term linear in $k$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_k &= (C_1 + C_2 k) \\cdot 1^k + C_3 \\alpha^k + C_4 \\beta^k = C_1 + C_2 k + C_3 \\alpha^k + C_4 \\beta^k \\label{eq:gen_sol_E} \\tag{5} \\\\\nO_k &= (C_1 + C_2 k) \\cdot 1^k - C_3 \\alpha^k - C_4 \\beta^k = C_1 + C_2 k - C_3 \\alpha^k - C_4 \\beta^k \\label{eq:gen_sol_O} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Superposition Principle\nThe system is linear, so we can use the superposition principle to find the temperature field.\n\\[\\boxed{\nT_n = T_n^{(source)}(I_{source}) + T_n^{(sink)}(I_{sink})\n}\\]\nThe total temperature field $T_n$ is the sum of two fields:\n1.  $T_n^{(0)}(I)$: due to a current $I$ injected at node 0, with the sink at infinity.\n2.  $T_n^{(4)}(-I)$: due to a current $-I$ injected at node 4 (i.e., current $I$ extracted), with the sink at infinity.\nThe network structure is invariant under translation by an even number of nodes. This symmetry implies $T_n^{(m)}(I) = T_{n-m}^{(0)}(I)$ for any even node $m$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nT_n = T_n^{(0)}(I) + T_n^{(4)}(-I) = T_n^{(0)}(I) - T_n^{(4)}(I) = T_n^{(0)}(I) - T_{n-4}^{(0)}(I) \\label{eq:superposition_apply}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe can now express the temperatures at nodes 0 and 4.

We are asked to find the final velocity of the mirror after the interaction.\n\nThe system consists of:\n1.  **An ideal mirror**: It has a rest mass $m$ and an area $S_{\\circ}$. The area is not relevant for this one-dimensional calculation. The mirror is \"ideal,\" meaning it perfectly reflects all incident photons.\n2.  **A beam of photons**: The total energy of the incident photons is $E$. The problem states the photons are incident with constant power for a certain period, which is a description of how the total energy $E$ is delivered.\n\nThe physical process is as follows:\n*   **Initial State**: The mirror moves with an initial velocity $v_0 = \\beta_0 c$ along a specific direction (let's call it the positive x-axis). The beam of photons, with total energy $E$, travels in the same direction, towards the mirror.\n*   **Interaction**: The photons strike the mirror and are reflected.

Therefore, the total relativistic energy and momentum of the system must be conserved. We will set up the conservation equations by considering the state of the system before and after the interaction.\n\nThe fundamental principles are:\nThe conservation of total energy:\n\\[\\boxed{E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}}\\]\nThe conservation of total momentum (in one dimension):\n\\[\\boxed{p_{\\text{initial}} = p_{\\text{final}}}\\]\nThe relativistic energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v = \\beta c$ is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{E_{\\text{particle}} = \\gamma m c^2 = \\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}}\\]\nThe relativistic momentum of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v = \\beta c$ is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{p_{\\text{particle}} = \\gamma m v = \\frac{m \\beta c}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}}\\]\nThe relationship between energy and momentum for a photon (or a beam of photons) is:\n\\[\\boxed{p_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c}}\\]\n\nApplying these principles, we can write the expressions for the total energy and momentum before and after the interaction.\n\n**Before Interaction (Initial State):**\n*   Mirror energy: $E_{m,0} = \\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_0^2}}$\n*   Mirror momentum: $p_{m,0} = \\frac{m \\beta_0 c}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_0^2}}$\n*   Incident photons energy: $E$\n*   Incident photons momentum: $p_{\\gamma,0} = \\frac{E}{c}$ (positive, as they move in the same direction as the mirror)\n\n**After Interaction (Final State):**\n*   Mirror energy: $E_{m,1} = \\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_1^2}}$\n*   Mirror momentum: $p_{m,1} = \\frac{m \\beta_1 c}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_1^2}}$\n*   Reflected photons energy: $E'$\n*   Reflected photons momentum: $p_{\\gamma,1} = -\\frac{E'}{c}$ (negative, as they are reflected and move in the opposite direction)\n\nThe conservation equations are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Energy Conservation: } E + \\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_0^2}} &= E' + \\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_1^2}} \\label{eq:energy_cons} \\tag{1} \\\\\n\\text{Momentum Conservation: } \\frac{E}{c} + \\frac{m \\beta_0 c}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_0^2}} &= -\\frac{E'}{c} + \\frac{m \\beta_1 c}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_1^2}} \\label{eq:momentum_cons} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solving the System of Conservation Equations\nWe now have a system of two equations (\\ref{eq:energy_cons} and \\ref{eq:momentum_cons}) with two unknowns, $\\beta_1$ and $E'$.

The system consists of a homogeneous rectangular picture frame of mass `m`, with a long side of length `2c` and a short side of length `2d`. A light, inextensible string of total length `2a` is attached to the two vertices of one of the long sides. This assembly is hung on a single, frictionless nail. The entire system is under the influence of a uniform gravitational field with acceleration `g`.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the equilibrium angle `α`, defined as the angle between the long side of the picture frame and the horizontal. The problem specifies that we are interested in a non-trivial tilted equilibrium, where `α \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]`.\n\nThe variables are defined as follows:\n*   `m`: The mass of the picture frame.\n*   `g`: The acceleration due to gravity.\n*   `c`: Half the length of the long side of the frame.\n*   `d`: Half the length of the short side of the frame.\n*   `a`: Half the length of the string.\n*   `α`: The angle between the frame's long side and the horizontal at equilibrium.\n\nA crucial condition is provided: `c^4 > a^2d^2 - c^2d^2`. As will be shown, this condition ensures that a stable, tilted equilibrium position (`α > 0`) exists.\n\nWe make the following standard assumptions:\n*   The string is massless and inextensible.\n*   The nail is a point-like, frictionless pivot.\n*   The picture frame is a rigid, homogeneous body.\n\n### Step 1: Geometric Model and Potential Energy\nThe fundamental principle for determining stable equilibrium is that the system's total potential energy must be at a minimum.\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Principle of Minimum Potential Energy for Stable Equilibrium}}\\]\nFor a rigid body in a uniform gravitational field, the potential energy `U_g` is proportional to the vertical height of its center of mass (CM). To minimize `U_g`, the CM must be at the lowest possible vertical position. When an object is suspended from a single pivot point (the nail, N), the CM must lie on the vertical line passing directly below N. Therefore, minimizing the CM's height is equivalent to maximizing the vertical distance between the pivot N and the CM, which is the total distance `h = d(N, CM)`.\n\nTo analyze the geometry, we establish a 2D coordinate system fixed to the picture frame. Let the origin `O(0,0)` be the midpoint of the top long side of the frame (where the string is attached). The x-axis lies along this top edge, and the y-axis is perpendicular to it, pointing downwards into the frame.\n*   The vertices where the string is attached are `V₁(-c, 0)` and `V₂(c, 0)`.\n*   The center of mass of the homogeneous frame is at its geometric center, `CM(0, d)`.\n*   The nail's position is `N(x, y)` in this frame-fixed coordinate system.\n\nThe string has a fixed length `2a` and passes over the nail N, connecting `V₁` and `V₂`. This geometric constraint defines the locus of possible positions for the nail N.\n\\[\\boxed{d(N, V_1) + d(N, V_2) = 2a}\\]\nThis is the definition of an ellipse with foci at `V₁` and `V₂`. The semi-major axis is `a`, and the distance from the center to each focus is `c`. The semi-minor axis `b` is given by `a^2 = b^2 + c^2`, so `b^2 = a^2 - c^2`. The equation of the ellipse on which N must lie is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \\label{eq:ellipse}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nPhysically, the nail must be above the frame's top edge, which in our coordinate system (y-axis pointing down) means the y-coordinate of the nail must be negative (`y < 0`).\n\nWe can parameterize the ellipse to describe the position of the nail N.\n\\[\\boxed{x(\\theta) = a \\sin\\theta, \\quad y(\\theta) = b \\cos\\theta}\\]\nThe constraint `y < 0` implies `b\\cos\\theta < 0`. Since `b = \\sqrt{a^2-c^2} > 0`, we must have `\\cos\\theta < 0`.\n\nNow, we express the square of the distance `h` between the nail `N(x, y)` and the center of mass `CM(0, d)` as a function of the parameter `θ`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nh^2(\\theta) &= (x-0)^2 + (y-d)^2 \\\\\n&= (a\\sin\\theta)^2 + (b\\cos\\theta - d)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= a^2\\sin^2\\theta + b^2\\cos^2\\theta - 2bd\\cos\\theta + d^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= a^2(1-\\cos^2\\theta) + b^2\\cos^2\\theta - 2bd\\cos\\theta + d^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= a^2 + d^2 - 2bd\\cos\\theta + (b^2 - a^2)\\cos^2\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{Using } b^2 - a^2 &= -c^2, \\text{ we get:} \\nonumber \\\\\nh^2(\\theta) &= a^2 + d^2 - 2bd\\cos\\theta - c^2\\cos^2\\theta \\label{eq:h_squared}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Finding Equilibrium Positions\nTo find the equilibrium configurations, which correspond to extrema of `h`, we find the critical points of `h^2(\\theta)` by setting its derivative with respect to `θ` to zero.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d(h^2)}{d\\theta} = 0}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d(h^2)}{d\\theta} &= \\frac{d}{d\\theta} (a^2 + d^2 - 2bd\\cos\\theta - c^2\\cos^2\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -2bd(-\\sin\\theta) - c^2(2\\cos\\theta)(-\\sin\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2bd\\sin\\theta + 2c^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2\\sin\\theta(bd + c^2\\cos\\theta) \\label{eq:derivative}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSetting the derivative to zero gives two families of solutions:\n1.  `\\sin\\theta = 0`: This implies `\\theta = k\\pi` for integer `k`. This corresponds to the nail being on the frame's y-axis (`x=0`). We must check the physical constraint `\\cos\\theta < 0`.\n    *   If `\\theta = 0, \\pm 2\\pi, ...`, then `\\cos\\theta = 1 > 0`, which is physically impossible.\n    *   If `\\theta = \\pm \\pi, \\pm 3\\pi, ...`, then `\\cos\\theta = -1 < 0`. This is a valid physical solution, corresponding to `N(0, -b)`. This is the symmetric, non-tilted equilibrium where `α = 0`.\n2.  `bd + c^2\\cos\\theta = 0`: This gives `\\cos\\theta = -\\frac{bd}{c^2}`. Since `b, d, c` are positive, `\\cos\\theta` is negative, satisfying the physical constraint. This solution corresponds to the tilted equilibrium (`α > 0`) that we seek. For a real solution for `\\theta` to exist, we need `|\\cos\\theta| \\le 1`, which means `bd \\le c^2`. The problem's given condition `c^4 > a^2d^2 - c^2d^2` is equivalent to `c^4 > d^2(a^2-c^2) = d^2b^2`, which implies `c^2 > bd`. This guarantees the existence of the tilted equilibrium.\n\n### Step 3: Stability Analysis of Equilibrium Positions\nFor the equilibrium to be stable, `h` (and thus `h^2`) must be a maximum. This requires the second derivative of `h^2(\\theta)` to be negative.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d^2(h^2)}{d\\theta^2} < 0}\\]\nFirst, we compute the second derivative:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d^2(h^2)}{d\\theta^2} &= \\frac{d}{d\\theta} [2\\sin\\theta(bd + c^2\\cos\\theta)] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2\\cos\\theta(bd + c^2\\cos\\theta) + 2\\sin\\theta(-c^2\\sin\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2bd\\cos\\theta + 2c^2\\cos^2\\theta - 2c^2\\sin^2\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2bd\\cos\\theta + 2c^2\\cos^2\\theta - 2c^2(1-\\cos^2\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 4c^2\\cos^2\\theta + 2bd\\cos\\theta - 2c^2 \\label{eq:second_derivative}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we evaluate the stability for the tilted equilibrium (`\\cos\\theta = -bd/c^2`):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d^2(h^2)}{d\\theta^2} \\bigg|_{\\text{tilted}} &= 4c^2\\left(-\\frac{bd}{c^2}\\right)^2 + 2bd\\left(-\\frac{bd}{c^2}\\right) - 2c^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 4c^2\\left(\\frac{b^2d^2}{c^4}\\right) - \\frac{2b^2d^2}{c^2} - 2c^2 = \\frac{4b^2d^2}{c^2} - \\frac{2b^2d^2}{c^2} - 2c^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{2b^2d^2}{c^2} - 2c^2 = \\frac{2}{c^2}(b^2d^2 - c^4) \\label{eq:stability}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom the problem's condition `c^4 > b^2d^2`, we know `b^2d^2 - c^4 < 0`. Thus, the second derivative is negative, confirming that the tilted equilibrium is stable. For completeness, for the symmetric case (`\\cos\\theta = -1`), the second derivative is `2(c^2-bd)`, which is positive since `c^2 > bd`, indicating it is an unstable equilibrium.\n\n### Step 4: Relating Frame Geometry to the Equilibrium Angle α\nIn equilibrium, the line connecting the nail N to the center of mass CM is vertical. The angle `α` is the angle between the frame's long side (our x-axis) and the horizontal. By geometry, this angle `α` is also the angle between the frame's y-axis and the vertical line N-CM. The vector from CM to N in the frame's coordinate system is `\\vec{r}_{CM \\to N} = (x, y-d)`.\n\\[\\boxed{\\tan\\alpha = \\left|\\frac{\\text{component of } \\vec{r}_{CM \\to N} \\text{ along x-axis}}{\\text{component of } \\vec{r}_{CM \\to N} \\text{ along y-axis}}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{x}{y-d}\\right|}\\]\nWe calculate the components `x` and `y-d` at the stable tilted equilibrium point, where `\\cos\\theta = -bd/c^2`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ny-d &= b\\cos\\theta - d = b\\left(-\\frac{bd}{c^2}\\right) - d = -\\frac{b^2d}{c^2} - d \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -d\\left(\\frac{b^2}{c^2} + 1\\right) = -d\\left(\\frac{b^2+c^2}{c^2}\\right) = -d\\frac{a^2}{c^2} \\label{eq:y_minus_d}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor the x-component, we first find `\\sin\\theta`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sin^2\\theta &= 1 - \\cos^2\\theta = 1 - \\left(-\\frac{bd}{c^2}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{b^2d^2}{c^4} = \\frac{c^4 - b^2d^2}{c^4} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\sin\\theta &= \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{c^4 - b^2d^2}}{c^2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe two signs correspond to symmetric left-tilted and right-tilted equilibrium positions. The magnitude of `α` is the same for both.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx = a\\sin\\theta = \\pm a \\frac{\\sqrt{c^4 - b^2d^2}}{c^2} \\label{eq:x_val}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation of the Angle α\nWe substitute the expressions for `x` and `y-d` into the formula for `tanα`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tan\\alpha &= \\left| \\frac{x}{y-d} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\pm a \\frac{\\sqrt{c^4 - b^2d^2}}{c^2}}{-d \\frac{a^2}{c^2}} \\right| \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left| \\mp \\frac{a\\sqrt{c^4 - b^2d^2}}{c^2} \\cdot \\frac{c^2}{da^2} \\right| \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left| \\mp \\frac{\\sqrt{c^4 - b^2d^2}}{ad} \\right| \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sqrt{c^4 - b^2d^2}}{ad} \\label{eq:tan_alpha_intermediate}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo express the result in terms of the given problem parameters `a, c, d`, we substitute `b^2 = a^2 - c^2`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tan\\alpha &= \\frac{\\sqrt{c^4 - d^2(a^2-c^2)}}{ad} \\label{eq:tan_alpha_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe angle `α` is the principal value of the arctangent of this positive expression, which lies in `(0, \\pi/2)`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle `α` between the long side of the picture frame and the horizontal when in equilibrium is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{c^4 - d^2(a^2-c^2)}}{ad}\\right)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The particles are bound by an attractive central force with magnitude $F(r) = \\alpha/r^2$, where $r$ is the distance between them and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant. The system is analyzed using a semi-classical Bohr model in the zero-momentum (center-of-mass) frame C.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts:\n1.  We are asked to determine the maximum value of the coupling constant, $\\alpha_c$, for which the bound pair $\\mathrm{X_{2}}$ is stable in its ground state (principal quantum number $n=1$). A stable state is defined as one having a real-valued total energy.\n2.  With the coupling constant set to $\\alpha = \\alpha_c/2$, we consider a collision experiment. The $\\mathrm{X_{2}}$ pair, initially in its ground state ($n=1$) and at rest in the laboratory frame L, is bombarded by a massless, ultra-high-speed particle of energy $E$. This collision causes $\\mathrm{X_{2}}$ to transition to an excited state ($\\mathrm{X_{2}}^*$) and emit a photon. We must find the minimum energy, $E_1$, of the incident particle required for this process to occur. To find this minimum energy, we will consider the transition to the lowest possible excited state, which is the first excited state ($n=2$).\n\nThe relevant physical constants are the speed of light, $c$, and the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 1: Semi-Classical Dynamics of the Bound State\nIn the center-of-mass frame C, the two particles of mass $M$ are assumed to move in a symmetric circular orbit. If the distance between them is $r$, each particle orbits the center of mass at a radius $R = r/2$. Let $v$ be the speed of each particle and $p$ be the magnitude of its relativistic momentum.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nWe apply the relativistic form of Newton's second law and the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule for the total angular momentum of the system.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{L = n\\hbar, \\quad n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe total angular momentum $L$ of the two-particle system is the sum of the angular momenta of each particle about the center of mass:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL = pR + pR = 2p(r/2) = pr\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nApplying the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\npr = n\\hbar\n\\label{eq:quantization} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe attractive force on one particle due to the other is $F = \\alpha/r^2$. This force provides the necessary centripetal force to maintain the circular orbit. For relativistic uniform circular motion, the magnitude of the force is equal to the magnitude of the rate of change of momentum. Since the speed $v$ is constant, the momentum magnitude $p$ is also constant. The change in the momentum vector $\\vec{p}$ is solely due to the change in its direction. The magnitude of this rate of change is $|\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}| = p\\omega$, where $\\omega = v/R$ is the angular velocity.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF &= \\left|\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}\\right| = p\\omega = p \\left(\\frac{v}{R}\\right) = p \\left(\\frac{v}{r/2}\\right) = \\frac{2pv}{r}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEquating this with the given force magnitude:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\alpha}{r^2} &= \\frac{2pv}{r} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{\\alpha}{r} &= 2pv\n\\label{eq:force_balance} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe combine the quantization condition (eq. \\eqref{eq:quantization}) and the force equation (eq. \\eqref{eq:force_balance}) to find the particle's speed. From eq. \\eqref{eq:quantization}, $p = n\\hbar/r$. Substituting this into eq. \\eqref{eq:force_balance}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\alpha}{r} &= 2\\left(\\frac{n\\hbar}{r}\\right)v \\nonumber \\\\\n\\alpha &= 2n\\hbar v \\nonumber \\\\\nv &= \\frac{\\alpha}{2n\\hbar}\n\\label{eq:velocity} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Relativistic Energy of the Bound State\nThe total energy of the bound state, $E_n$, corresponds to the invariant mass energy of the composite particle $\\mathrm{X_{2}}$. We calculate this using the relativistic Hamiltonian for the two-particle system.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe total energy of a stationary state of a two-particle system with a central potential $V(r)$ is given by the value of its relativistic Hamiltonian. In the center-of-mass frame for two identical particles:\n\\[\\boxed{E_{\\text{total}} = H = 2\\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (Mc^2)^2} + V(r)}\\]\nThe potential energy $V(r)$ corresponding to an attractive force $F(r) = \\alpha/r^2$ is obtained by integration, with the convention $V(\\infty)=0$:\n\\[\\boxed{V(r) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} F(r') dr' = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\frac{\\alpha}{r'^2} dr' = \\frac{\\alpha}{r} \\bigg|_{\\infty}^{r} = -\\frac{\\alpha}{r}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe total energy of the bound state $X_2$ in its center-of-mass frame, which we denote as $E_n$, is given by the Hamiltonian:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_n = 2\\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (Mc^2)^2} - \\frac{\\alpha}{r}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe term $\\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (Mc^2)^2}$ is the total energy of a single particle, equal to $\\gamma Mc^2$, where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ is the Lorentz factor. The relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma M v$. From the dynamical analysis in Step 1 (eq. \\eqref{eq:force_balance}), we have the relation $\\alpha/r = 2pv = 2(\\gamma M v)v = 2\\gamma M v^2$. Substituting these into the energy expression:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_n &= 2(\\gamma Mc^2) - (2\\gamma M v^2) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2\\gamma M (c^2 - v^2)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing the identity $c^2 - v^2 = c^2/\\gamma^2$, which follows from the definition of $\\gamma$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_n &= 2\\gamma M \\left(\\frac{c^2}{\\gamma^2}\\right) = \\frac{2Mc^2}{\\gamma} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2Mc^2\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\n\\label{eq:total_energy_v} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we substitute the quantized velocity from eq. \\eqref{eq:velocity}, $v = \\alpha/(2n\\hbar)$, into this expression. The ratio $v/c$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2n\\hbar c}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, the quantized total energy levels of the bound state $\\mathrm{X_{2}}$ are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_n = 2Mc^2\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2n\\hbar c}\\right)^2}\n\\label{eq:energy_levels} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Maximum Coupling Constant $\\alpha_c$\nFor a stable bound state to exist, its total energy $E_n$ must be a real quantity. This condition imposes an upper limit on the value of $\\alpha$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe energy of a physical state must be a real number.\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Im}(E_n) = 0}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nFrom the energy expression, eq. \\eqref{eq:energy_levels}, the term inside the square root must be non-negative for the energy to be real.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n1 - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2n\\hbar c}\\right)^2 \\ge 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe problem requires the ground state ($n=1$) to be stable. Applying this condition for $n=1$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n1 - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2(1)\\hbar c}\\right)^2 &\\ge 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\hbar c}\\right)^2 &\\le 1 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\alpha &\\le 2\\hbar c \\quad (\\text{since } \\alpha > 0)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe maximum value of $\\alpha$ for which a stable ground state can exist is therefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\alpha_c = 2\\hbar c\n\\label{eq:alpha_c} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Energies for the Collision Process\nFor the second part of the problem, the coupling constant is set to $\\alpha = \\alpha_c/2 = \\hbar c$. We calculate the rest mass energies of the initial state $\\mathrm{X_{2}}$ (ground state, $n=1$) and the final excited state $\\mathrm{X_{2}^*}$. To find the minimum incident energy, we assume the final state is the lowest possible excited state, i.e., the first excited state ($n=2$).\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nWe use the derived formula for the total energy of the bound state, which represents its rest mass energy.\n\\[\\boxed{E_n = 2Mc^2\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2n\\hbar c}\\right)^2}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nWith $\\alpha = \\hbar c$, the energy formula becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_n = 2Mc^2\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\hbar c}{2n\\hbar c}\\right)^2} = 2Mc^2\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4n^2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe initial state is the ground state ($n=1$), which we denote as $X_2$. Its rest mass energy is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{X_2} = E_{n=1} = 2Mc^2\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4(1)^2}} = 2Mc^2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\sqrt{3}Mc^2\n\\label{eq:E_X2} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe final state is the first excited state ($n=2$), which we denote as $X_2^*$. Its rest mass energy is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{X_2^*} = E_{n=2} = 2Mc^2\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4(2)^2}} = 2Mc^2\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{16}} = 2Mc^2\\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}Mc^2\n\\label{eq:E_X2_star} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Collision using Relativistic Invariants\nThe collision process is: (massless particle) + $X_2 \\to X_2^* + \\text{photon}$. We analyze this using the conservation of the total four-momentum of the system.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe total four-momentum of an isolated system is conserved. The four-momentum is a Lorentz four-vector $P^\\mu = (E_{\\text{tot}}/c, \\vec{P}_{\\text{tot}})$.\n\\[\\boxed{P^\\mu_{\\text{initial}} = P^\\mu_{\\text{final}}}\\]\nThis implies that the square of the total four-momentum, $s = P^\\mu P_\\mu c^2 = E_{\\text{tot}}^2 - (\\vec{P}_{\\text{tot}}c)^2$, is a Lorentz invariant scalar and is also conserved.\n\\[\\boxed{s_{\\text{initial}} = s_{\\text{final}}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nIn the laboratory frame (L), the initial state consists of the incident massless particle with energy $E$ and momentum magnitude $P=E/c$, and the $X_2$ pair at rest with energy $E_{X_2}$ and zero momentum.\nThe total energy and momentum of the initial system in frame L are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{\\text{tot, init}} &= E + E_{X_2} = E + \\sqrt{3}Mc^2 \\\\\nP_{\\text{tot, init}} &= E/c\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe invariant mass squared of the initial system is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ns_{\\text{init}} &= (E_{\\text{tot, init}})^2 - (P_{\\text{tot, init}}c)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (E + \\sqrt{3}Mc^2)^2 - ( (E/c) c)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (E^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}Mc^2 E + 3(Mc^2)^2) - E^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 3(Mc^2)^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}Mc^2 E\n\\label{eq:s_init} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe final state consists of the excited pair $X_2^*$ and an emitted photon. The reaction is possible only if the invariant mass of the initial system is sufficient to create the final state. To find the minimum incident energy $E_1$, we must consider the final state with the minimum possible invariant mass.

sphere of radius $R$ placed in a vacuum. The sphere is a conductive dielectric material, characterized by its relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$ and its electrical conductivity $\\sigma$. The permittivity of the vacuum is $\\varepsilon_0$. Initially, at time $t<0$, the sphere is electrically neutral (has zero free charge) and there is no external electric field.\n\nAt $t=0$, a uniform external electric field $\\vec{E}_0$ is applied. Due to the sphere's conductivity, free charges within the material begin to move and redistribute, accumulating on the surface. This transient process continues until a steady state is reached where the electric field inside the conductive material becomes zero. During this process, the flow of charge (current) inside the resistive medium generates Joule heat.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the total amount of Joule heat, $Q_{tot}$, generated inside the sphere from the initial moment $t=0$ until the system reaches its final steady state at $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nWe define the following variables:\n*   $R$: Radius of the sphere.\n*   $\\varepsilon_r$: Relative permittivity of the sphere material.\n*   $\\sigma$: Electrical conductivity of the sphere material.\n*   $\\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of vacuum.\n*   $\\vec{E}_0$: Uniform external electric field, applied at $t=0$. We align the z-axis with $\\vec{E}_0$, so $\\vec{E}_0 = E_0 \\hat{z}$.\n*   $Q_{tot}$: Total Joule heat generated in the sphere.\n\nWe assume the material is a linear, homogeneous, and isotropic conductive dielectric.\n\n### Step 1: General Form of the Electric Potential\nThe problem possesses azimuthal symmetry around the z-axis. Since there are no free charges in the volume of the sphere or in the vacuum outside, the electric potential $U$ must satisfy Laplace's equation in both regions. The general solution in spherical coordinates, which respects the symmetry and the condition that the field far from the sphere is $\\vec{E}_0$, can be written in terms of Legendre polynomials of order 1.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\nabla^2 U = 0\n}\\]\nThe potential inside ($U_{in}$) and outside ($U_{out}$) the sphere can be expressed with time-dependent coefficients, as the charge distribution evolves over time. The potential must be continuous at the surface of the sphere ($r=R$).\n\\[\\boxed{\nU_{out}(R, \\theta, t) = U_{in}(R, \\theta, t)\n}\\]\nThe general forms for the potential are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(r, \\theta, t) = \\begin{cases} U_{out}(r, \\theta, t) = -E_0 r \\cos\\theta + A(t) \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r^2} & \\text{for } r > R \\\\ U_{in}(r, \\theta, t) = C(t) r \\cos\\theta & \\text{for } r < R \\end{cases}\n\\label{eq:potential_forms}\n\\end{align}\nThe term $-E_0 r \\cos\\theta$ represents the potential of the uniform external field. The term $A(t) \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r^2}$ represents the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere, which vanishes at infinity. The term $C(t) r \\cos\\theta$ corresponds to a uniform electric field inside the sphere, $\\vec{E}_{in}(t) = -C(t)\\hat{z}$, and is chosen because the potential must be finite at the origin $r=0$.\n\nApplying the continuity boundary condition at $r=R$ allows us to relate the coefficients $A(t)$ and $C(t)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n-E_0 R \\cos\\theta + A(t) \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{R^2} &= C(t) R \\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n-E_0 R + \\frac{A(t)}{R^2} &= C(t) R \\nonumber \\\\\nA(t) &= (C(t) + E_0) R^3\n\\label{eq:A_C_relation}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the Governing Differential Equation\nThe dynamics of charge redistribution are governed by the principle of charge conservation at the surface of the sphere. The normal component of the current density flowing from the interior to the surface, $j_n$, must equal the rate of increase of the surface free charge density, $\\sigma_f$.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\vec{j} \\cdot \\hat{r} = \\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dt}\n}\\]\nThe current density inside the sphere is given by Ohm's law.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\vec{j} = \\sigma \\vec{E}_{in}\n}\\]\nThe surface free charge density $\\sigma_f$ is related to the discontinuity in the normal component of the electric displacement vector $\\vec{D}$ at the surface, which is a consequence of Gauss's law.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\sigma_f = (\\vec{D}_{out} - \\vec{D}_{in}) \\cdot \\hat{r} \\Big|_{r=R}\n}\\]\nFirst, we find the electric field inside from the potential: $\\vec{E}_{in} = -\\nabla U_{in} = -\\nabla(C(t) r \\cos\\theta) = -C(t) \\hat{z}$. The radial component of the current density at the surface is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nj_n = \\vec{j} \\cdot \\hat{r} \\Big|_{r=R} = \\sigma \\vec{E}_{in} \\cdot \\hat{r} \\Big|_{r=R} = \\sigma (-C(t)\\hat{z}) \\cdot \\hat{r} = -\\sigma C(t) \\cos\\theta\n\\label{eq:jn}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we find the radial components of the displacement vectors at $r=R$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{r,in} &= \\vec{E}_{in} \\cdot \\hat{r} = -C(t) \\cos\\theta \\implies D_{r,in} = \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r E_{r,in} = -\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r C(t) \\cos\\theta \\label{eq:Dr_in} \\\\\nE_{r,out} &= -\\frac{\\partial U_{out}}{\\partial r} = E_0 \\cos\\theta + 2A(t) \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r^3} \\nonumber \\\\\nE_{r,out}\\Big|_{r=R} &= \\left(E_0 + \\frac{2A(t)}{R^3}\\right)\\cos\\theta = \\left(E_0 + \\frac{2(C(t)+E_0)R^3}{R^3}\\right)\\cos\\theta = (3E_0 + 2C(t))\\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\nD_{r,out}\\Big|_{r=R} &= \\varepsilon_0 E_{r,out}\\Big|_{r=R} = \\varepsilon_0 (3E_0 + 2C(t))\\cos\\theta \\label{eq:Dr_out}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we compute the surface free charge density:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_f &= D_{r,out}\\Big|_{r=R} - D_{r,in}\\Big|_{r=R} = \\left[ \\varepsilon_0 (3E_0 + 2C(t)) - (-\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r C(t)) \\right] \\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left[ 3\\varepsilon_0 E_0 + \\varepsilon_0(2 + \\varepsilon_r)C(t) \\right] \\cos\\theta\n\\label{eq:sigma_f}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTaking the time derivative gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dt} = \\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} \\cos\\theta\n\\label{eq:dsigmadt}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFinally, applying the charge conservation equation by equating \\eqref{eq:jn} and \\eqref{eq:dsigmadt}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n-\\sigma C(t) \\cos\\theta &= \\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} \\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} &= -\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)} C(t)\n\\label{eq:DE_C}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is the first-order linear differential equation for the coefficient $C(t)$.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Condition and Solution of the Differential Equation\nAt the instant the field is applied ($t=0^+$), the free charges have not yet had time to move. Therefore, the sphere behaves as a pure, uncharged dielectric. For a neutral dielectric sphere in a uniform external field $\\vec{E}_0$, the internal electric field is a known result from electrostatics.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\vec{E}_{in}(t=0^+) = \\frac{3}{\\varepsilon_r+2}\\vec{E}_0\n}\\]\nWe relate this to our expression for the internal field, $\\vec{E}_{in}(t) = -C(t)\\hat{z}$, at $t=0^+$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n-C(0)\\hat{z} &= \\frac{3}{\\varepsilon_r+2}E_0\\hat{z} \\nonumber \\\\\nC(0) &= -\\frac{3E_0}{\\varepsilon_r+2}\n\\label{eq:C0}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe solution to the differential equation \\eqref{eq:DE_C} is an exponential decay of the form $C(t) = C(0) e^{-t/\\tau}$, where the relaxation time $\\tau$ is given by $\\tau = \\frac{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}{\\sigma}$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nC(t) = C(0) e^{-t/\\tau} = -\\frac{3E_0}{\\varepsilon_r+2} e^{-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t}\n\\label{eq:C_t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Time-Dependent Electric Field inside the Sphere\nThe electric field inside the sphere is directly related to the coefficient $C(t)$. This field is responsible for driving the current and thus generating Joule heat.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\vec{E} = -\\nabla U\n}\\]\nUsing the potential from \\eqref{eq:potential_forms} and the solution for $C(t)$ from \\eqref{eq:C_t}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{E}_{in}(t) = -C(t)\\hat{z} = \\left(\\frac{3E_0}{\\varepsilon_r+2}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t} \\hat{z}\n\\label{eq:E_in_t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe internal field starts at the value for a pure dielectric and decays exponentially to zero as the free charges accumulate on the surface, perfectly shielding the interior, as expected for a conductor in a static field.\n\n### Step 5: Time-Dependent Surface Free Charge Density\nAs a consistency check, we can calculate the surface free charge density as a function of time by substituting our solution for $C(t)$ into the expression for $\\sigma_f$ from Step 2, Eq. \\eqref{eq:sigma_f}.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\sigma_f(t) = \\left[ 3\\varepsilon_0 E_0 + \\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)C(t) \\right] \\cos\\theta\n}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_f(t) &= \\left[ 3\\varepsilon_0 E_0 + \\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)\\left(-\\frac{3E_0}{\\varepsilon_r+2} e^{-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t}\\right) \\right] \\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 3\\varepsilon_0 E_0 \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t}\\right) \\cos\\theta\n\\label{eq:sigma_f_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAt $t=0$, $\\sigma_f(0) = 0$, which is correct as the sphere is initially uncharged. As $t \\to \\infty$, $\\sigma_f(t) \\to 3\\varepsilon_0 E_0 \\cos\\theta$, which is the correct surface charge distribution for a conducting sphere in a uniform external field. This confirms the physical correctness of our model.\n\n### Step 6: Joule Heat Power Calculation\nThe volumetric power density of Joule heating, $p_J$, is given by the product of the current density and the electric field.\n\\[\\boxed{\np_J = \\vec{j} \\cdot \\vec{E}_{in}\n}\\]\nUsing Ohm's law, $\\vec{j} = \\sigma \\vec{E}_{in}$, this becomes $p_J = \\sigma E_{in}^2$. Since $\\vec{E}_{in}(t)$ is uniform throughout the sphere, so is $p_J(t)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{in}^2(t) &= \\left| \\vec{E}_{in}(t) \\right|^2 = \\left(\\frac{3E_0}{\\varepsilon_r+2}\\right)^2 e^{-2\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t} \\\\\np_J(t) &= \\sigma E_{in}^2(t) = \\sigma \\frac{9E_0^2}{(\\varepsilon_r+2)^2} e^{-2\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t}\n\\label{eq:power_density}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe total Joule heat power $W_J(t)$ is the power density integrated over the volume of the sphere, $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nW_J(t) = \\int_V p_J(t) dV = p_J(t) \\cdot V = \\left(\\sigma \\frac{9E_0^2}{(\\varepsilon_r+2)^2} e^{-2\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\nW_J(t) = \\frac{12\\pi\\sigma R^3 E_0^2}{(\\varepsilon_r+2)^2} e^{-2\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t}\n\\label{eq:total_power}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Total Joule Heat Calculation\nThe total Joule heat $Q_{tot}$ generated is the time integral of the total power $W_J(t)$ from the initial moment $t=0$ to the final steady state at $t=\\infty$.\n\\[\\boxed{\nQ_{tot} = \\int_0^\\infty W_J(t) dt\n}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nQ_{tot} &= \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{12\\pi\\sigma R^3 E_0^2}{(\\varepsilon_r+2)^2} e^{-2\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t} dt \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{12\\pi\\sigma R^3 E_0^2}{(\\varepsilon_r+2)^2} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-2\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t} dt \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{12\\pi\\sigma R^3 E_0^2}{(\\varepsilon_r+2)^2} \\left[ -\\frac{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}{2\\sigma} e^{-2\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}t} \\right]_0^\\infty \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{12\\pi\\sigma R^3 E_0^2}{(\\varepsilon_r+2)^2} \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}{2\\sigma}\\right)e^0 \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{12\\pi\\sigma R^3 E_0^2}{(\\varepsilon_r+2)^2} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_0(\\varepsilon_r+2)}{2\\sigma} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R^3 E_0^2}{\\varepsilon_r+2}\n\\label{eq:final_heat}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total Joule heat generated by the system from the initial state to the steady state is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{Q_{tot} = \\frac{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R^3 E_0^2}{\\varepsilon_r+2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The goal is to find the equation of the curve that is the projection of the boundary of the \"no-fling-off\" region onto the $xy$-plane.\n\nThe physical setup is as follows:\n*   **The Sphere**: Represents the puppy, with radius $R$. Its center is fixed at the point $\\vec{C} = (0, 0, H)$ in a Cartesian coordinate system, where $H > R$.\n*   **Coordinate System**: The origin is on the ground, the $z$-axis is vertical, and the ground is the plane $z=0$.\n*   **Gravity**: A uniform gravitational field acts in the negative $z$-direction, with acceleration $g$. The gravitational force on a droplet of mass $m$ is $\\vec{F}_g = (0, 0, -mg)$.\n*   **Rotation**: The sphere rotates with a constant angular velocity $\\vec{\\omega}$ about the x-axis. The magnitude of the angular velocity is $\\omega$, so $\\vec{\\omega} = (\\omega, 0, 0)$.\n*   **Droplet Detachment**: A water droplet on the surface is held by a normal contact force $\\vec{N}$. The droplet is flung off when this normal force becomes zero. We are interested in the boundary where this condition is met.\n*   **Condition**: The problem is considered for an angular velocity $\\omega > \\omega_{1}$, where $\\omega_{1}$ is the minimum angular velocity required to fling droplets off from the top of the sphere. This ensures that a non-trivial boundary exists.\n\nTo describe the position of a droplet on the sphere's surface, we use a spherical coordinate system whose origin is at the sphere's center $(0, 0, H)$. The position of a droplet relative to the center is $\\vec{r}_c$. The absolute position is $\\vec{r} = \\vec{C} + \\vec{r}_c$.\nThe spherical coordinates are defined with respect to the rotation axis (the x-axis):\n*   $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ is the polar angle measured from the positive x-axis.\n*   $\\varphi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle in the yz-plane, measured from the positive z-axis towards the positive y-axis.\n\nThe components of the relative position vector $\\vec{r}_c$ are:\n*   $x_c = R\\cos\\theta$\n*   $y_c = R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi$\n*   $z_c = R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi$\n\nThe absolute coordinates of the droplet are:\n*   $x = x_c = R\\cos\\theta$\n*   $y = y_c = R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi$\n*   $z = H + z_c = H + R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi$\n\nWe assume the droplet is a point mass and that it co-rotates with the sphere without slipping until the moment of detachment.\n\n### Step 1: Kinematics of a Droplet on the Sphere\nWe first determine the velocity and acceleration of a water droplet at an arbitrary point on the sphere's surface. The position vector of the droplet relative to the sphere's center is $\\vec{r}_c$. Since the center of the sphere is not accelerating, the kinematics can be analyzed in the frame of the center.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{r}_c = (R\\cos\\theta, R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi)}\n\\]\nFor an object undergoing uniform rotation with angular velocity $\\vec{\\omega}$ at a position $\\vec{r}_c$ relative to the axis of rotation, its velocity $\\vec{v}$ is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{v} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_c}\n\\]\nThe acceleration $\\vec{a}$ is the centripetal acceleration, given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{a} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_c)}\n\\]\nApplying these principles with $\\vec{\\omega} = (\\omega, 0, 0)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{v} &= \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\ \\omega & 0 & 0 \\\\ R\\cos\\theta & R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi & R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi \\end{vmatrix} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\hat{i}(0) - \\hat{j}(\\omega R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi) + \\hat{k}(\\omega R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (0, -\\omega R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi, \\omega R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi) \\label{eq:velocity}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{a} &= \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\ \\omega & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\omega R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi & \\omega R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi \\end{vmatrix} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\hat{i}(0) - \\hat{j}(\\omega^2 R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi) + \\hat{k}(-\\omega^2 R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (0, -\\omega^2 R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, -\\omega^2 R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi) \\label{eq:acceleration}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis acceleration vector points from the droplet's position towards the axis of rotation (the x-axis).\n\n### Step 2: Force Analysis and Condition for Detachment\nThe forces acting on the water droplet of mass $m$ are the gravitational force $\\vec{F}_g$ and the normal contact force $\\vec{N}$ from the sphere's surface.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{F}_g = m\\vec{g} = (0, 0, -mg)}\n\\]\nThe normal force is perpendicular to the surface and points radially outward from the center of the sphere. It can be written as $\\vec{N} = N \\hat{r}_c$, where $\\hat{r}_c = \\vec{r}_c/R$ is the unit radial vector.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{N} = N \\hat{r}_c}\n\\]\nAccording to Newton's second law, the net force on the droplet equals its mass times its acceleration.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\vec{N} + \\vec{F}_g = m\\vec{a}}\n\\]\nTo find the magnitude of the normal force, $N$, we project this vector equation onto the radial direction $\\hat{r}_c$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\vec{N} + \\vec{F}_g) \\cdot \\hat{r}_c &= (m\\vec{a}) \\cdot \\hat{r}_c \\nonumber \\\\\n\\vec{N} \\cdot \\hat{r}_c + \\vec{F}_g \\cdot \\hat{r}_c &= m(\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{r}_c) \\nonumber \\\\\nN + (m\\vec{g}) \\cdot \\hat{r}_c &= m(\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{r}_c) \\nonumber \\\\\nN &= m(\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{r}_c - \\vec{g} \\cdot \\hat{r}_c) \\label{eq:N_def}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe compute the dot products using $\\hat{r}_c = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, \\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{r}_c &= (0, -\\omega^2 R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, -\\omega^2 R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi) \\cdot (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, \\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\omega^2 R\\sin^2\\theta\\sin^2\\varphi - \\omega^2 R\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\varphi \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\omega^2 R \\sin^2\\theta (\\sin^2\\varphi + \\cos^2\\varphi) = -\\omega^2 R \\sin^2\\theta \\label{eq:a_dot_r}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{g} \\cdot \\hat{r}_c &= (0, 0, -g) \\cdot (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, \\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -g\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi \\label{eq:g_dot_r}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting these into Eq. \\eqref{eq:N_def}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nN &= m(-\\omega^2 R \\sin^2\\theta - (-g\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi)) \\nonumber \\\\\nN &= m(g\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi - \\omega^2 R \\sin^2\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\nN &= m\\sin\\theta(g\\cos\\varphi - \\omega^2 R\\sin\\theta) \\label{eq:N_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Boundary of the No-Fling-Off Region\nA droplet is not flung off as long as the surface exerts a non-negative (pushing) normal force.\n\\[\n\\boxed{N \\ge 0}\n\\]\nUsing the expression for $N$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:N_final}, and noting that $m>0$ and $\\sin\\theta \\ge 0$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, the condition for the droplet to remain on the sphere is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ng\\cos\\varphi - \\omega^2 R\\sin\\theta \\ge 0 \\label{eq:no_fling_condition}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe boundary of this \"no-fling-off\" region occurs when the normal force is exactly zero, $N=0$. This gives the equation for the boundary curve on the sphere's surface.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ng\\cos\\varphi = \\omega^2 R\\sin\\theta \\label{eq:boundary_spherical}\n\\end{align}\nAs a check, let's find the minimum angular velocity $\\omega_1$ to fling a droplet from the \"top\" of the sphere (maximum $z$, at $\\theta=\\pi/2, \\varphi=0$). At this point, $N = m\\sin(\\pi/2)(g\\cos(0) - \\omega^2 R\\sin(\\pi/2)) = m(g - \\omega^2 R)$. Detachment occurs if $N<0$, so $\\omega^2 R > g$. Thus, $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{g/R}$. The condition $\\omega > \\omega_1$ ensures that $g/(\\omega^2 R) < 1$, guaranteeing that a region where $N<0$ exists and the boundary curve is well-defined.\n\n### Step 4: Projecting the Boundary Curve onto the xy-plane\nTo find the projection of this boundary curve onto the $xy$-plane, we must express Eq. \\eqref{eq:boundary_spherical} in terms of the Cartesian coordinates $x$ and $y$. We use the coordinate transformation equations and a fundamental trigonometric identity.\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = R\\cos\\theta}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{y = R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sin^2\\varphi + \\cos^2\\varphi = 1}\n\\]\nFrom the coordinate definitions, we express $\\sin\\theta$ and $\\sin\\varphi$ in terms of $x$ and $y$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos\\theta &= \\frac{x}{R} \\implies \\sin\\theta = \\sqrt{1-\\cos^2\\theta} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{R^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R^2-x^2}}{R} \\quad (\\text{since } \\sin\\theta \\ge 0 \\text{ for } \\theta \\in [0,\\pi]) \\label{eq:sintheta} \\\\\n\\sin\\varphi &= \\frac{y}{R\\sin\\theta} = \\frac{y}{R \\frac{\\sqrt{R^2-x^2}}{R}} = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{R^2-x^2}} \\label{eq:sinphi}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom the boundary equation, Eq. \\eqref{eq:boundary_spherical}, we express $\\cos\\varphi$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos\\varphi = \\frac{\\omega^2 R}{g}\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\omega^2 R}{g} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{R^2-x^2}}{R}\\right) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{g}\\sqrt{R^2-x^2} \\label{eq:cosphi}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\sin\\varphi$ (Eq. \\eqref{eq:sinphi}) and $\\cos\\varphi$ (Eq. \\eqref{eq:cosphi}) into the identity $\\sin^2\\varphi + \\cos^2\\varphi = 1$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{R^2-x^2}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2}{g}\\sqrt{R^2-x^2}\\right)^2 &= 1 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{y^2}{R^2-x^2} + \\frac{\\omega^4}{g^2}(R^2-x^2) &= 1 \\label{eq:intermediate_cartesian}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFinally, we solve for $y^2$ to obtain the equation of the projected curve:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{y^2}{R^2-x^2} &= 1 - \\frac{\\omega^4}{g^2}(R^2-x^2) \\nonumber \\\\\ny^2 &= (R^2-x^2)\\left[1 - \\frac{\\omega^4}{g^2}(R^2-x^2)\\right] \\nonumber \\\\\ny^2 &= (R^2-x^2) \\frac{\\omega^4}{g^2} \\left[\\frac{g^2}{\\omega^4} - (R^2-x^2)\\right] \\nonumber \\\\\ny^2 &= \\frac{\\omega^4}{g^2}(R^2-x^2)\\left(x^2 - R^2 + \\frac{g^2}{\\omega^4}\\right) \\label{eq:final_derivation}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe equation of the curve projecting the boundary of the \"no-fling-off\" region onto the $xy$-plane is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{y^{2}=\\frac{\\omega^{4}}{g^{2}}(R^{2}-x^{2})\\left(x^{2}-R^{2}+\\frac{g^{2}}{\\omega^{4}}\\right)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

We are asked to find the spacing between adjacent primary maxima in the resulting diffraction pattern under specific geometric conditions.\n\nA spatial Cartesian coordinate system is established with the positive $x$-axis pointing vertically downward, the positive $z$-axis pointing horizontally towards a detection wall, and the $y$-axis completing the right-handed system (also horizontal). The horizontal plane is therefore the $y-z$ plane.\n\nThe physical setup and parameters are as follows:\n*   **Laser Beam:** An incident laser beam with a monochromatic wavelength $\\lambda$ travels along the positive $z$-direction. We assume the laser strikes the ruler at the origin of the coordinate system, $(0,0,0)$. The wave vector of the incident beam is $\\boldsymbol{k}$.\n*   **Steel Ruler (Grating):** The ruler is positioned horizontally, meaning the angle $\\xi$ it makes with the horizontal plane is zero. Thus, the ruler's surface lies entirely within the $y-z$ plane. The longitudinal direction of the ruler makes an angle $\\phi$ with the $z$-axis. The graduations on the ruler are a series of parallel lines, oriented perpendicular to the ruler's length, with a uniform spacing of $d$.\n*   **Diffraction Pattern:** The laser diffracts off the ruler's graduations. The resulting pattern is observed on a vertical wall parallel to the $x-y$ plane, located at a distance $L$ from the origin. The equation of this wall is $z=L$. A point on the diffraction pattern has coordinates $(x, y, L)$. The wave vector of a diffracted wave reaching this point is denoted by $\\boldsymbol{k}'$.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the spacing, $\\Delta y$, between adjacent primary maxima in the diffraction pattern, specifically for orders near the zeroth-order maximum ($n=0$).\n\nWe make the following assumptions:\n1.  The ruler acts as a one-dimensional reflection grating.\n2.  The scattering of light from the ruler is elastic, meaning the wavelength $\\lambda$ and the magnitude of the wave vector remain constant.\n\n### Step 1: Define Wave Vectors and Grating Geometry\nFirst, we express the incident and diffracted wave vectors, as well as the vectors describing the ruler's orientation, in our coordinate system. The magnitude of the wave vector is $k = |\\boldsymbol{k}| = |\\boldsymbol{k}'| = 2\\pi/\\lambda$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{Wave vector of a plane wave: } \\boldsymbol{k} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\boldsymbol{\\hat{n}} \\text{, where } \\boldsymbol{\\hat{n}} \\text{ is the direction of propagation.} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{Elastic scattering condition: } |\\boldsymbol{k}_{\\text{incident}}| = |\\boldsymbol{k}_{\\text{scattered}}| }\\]\n\nThe incident laser beam travels along the $+z$ direction, and the diffracted beam travels from the origin to a point $(x, y, L)$ on the wall.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol{k} &= \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}} \\label{eq:k_inc} \\tag{1} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}' &= \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\frac{x\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}} + y\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}} + L\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+L^2}} \\label{eq:k_diff} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe ruler lies in the $y-z$ plane. Its geometry is described by two orthogonal unit vectors in this plane:\n*   The unit vector along the ruler's length, making an angle $\\phi$ with the $z$-axis: $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{u}}_{\\text{ruler}} = \\sin\\phi\\,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}} + \\cos\\phi\\,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}$.\n*   The unit vector along the direction of the graduation lines, which are perpendicular to the ruler's length: $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{v}} = \\cos\\phi\\,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}} - \\sin\\phi\\,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}$.\nThe periodic structure of the grating is defined by the grating vector, which represents the displacement between adjacent graduations.\n*   Grating vector: $\\boldsymbol{d}_{\\text{vec}} = d\\,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{u}}_{\\text{ruler}}$.\n\n### Step 2: Apply Diffraction Conditions\nThe locations of the diffraction maxima are determined by the Laue conditions. These conditions relate the change in the wave vector, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{k} = \\boldsymbol{k}' - \\boldsymbol{k}$, to the symmetries of the grating. One condition arises from the continuous symmetry along the graduation lines, and the other from the periodic symmetry across them.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Laue condition for continuous symmetry: } (\\boldsymbol{k}' - \\boldsymbol{k}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0 \\text{, where } \\boldsymbol{u} \\text{ is the direction of symmetry.}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Laue condition for periodic symmetry: } (\\boldsymbol{k}' - \\boldsymbol{k}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} = 2n\\pi \\text{, where } \\boldsymbol{a} \\text{ is a lattice vector and } n \\in \\mathbb{Z}.}\\]\n\nLet $R = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+L^2}$ be the distance from the origin to the point $(x,y,L)$ on the wall.\n\n1.  **Continuous Symmetry:** The grating is translationally invariant along the direction of the graduation lines, $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{v}}$. This implies that the component of the wave vector parallel to $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{v}}$ is conserved.\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    (\\boldsymbol{k}' - \\boldsymbol{k}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{v}} = 0 \\implies \\boldsymbol{k}' \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{v}} &= \\boldsymbol{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{v}} \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda R} (x\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}} + y\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}} + L\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}) \\right) \\cdot (\\cos\\phi\\,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}} - \\sin\\phi\\,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}) &= \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}} \\right) \\cdot (\\cos\\phi\\,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}} - \\sin\\phi\\,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\frac{y\\cos\\phi - L\\sin\\phi}{R} &= -\\sin\\phi \\label{eq:cond1} \\tag{3}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n2.  **Periodic Symmetry:** Constructive interference occurs between waves scattered from adjacent graduation lines when the path difference corresponds to an integer multiple of the wavelength.

The coordinate system is defined with the origin at an incident point, the \\(x\\)-axis along the lower surface, and the \\(y\\)-axis pointing upwards, perpendicular to the surface.\n    *   At the lower surface (\\(y=0\\)), the refractive index is \\(n(y=0) = n_a\\).\n    *   At the upper surface (\\(y=d\\)), the refractive index is \\(n(y=d) = n_b\\), with \\(n_b > n_a\\).\n*   **Incident Light:** A parallel beam of monochromatic light with wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) is incident on the lower surface of the film from the medium below.\n*   **Surrounding Medium:** The medium below the film is air, with a refractive index \\(n_0 = 1\\).\n*   **Incidence Angle:** The light enters the film at an angle of incidence \\(i\\) with respect to the normal of the surface.\n*   **Interfering Beams:** We consider two beams:\n    1.  **Beam 1:** Enters the film at an origin point \\(O(0,0)\\), travels through the film, reflects internally at the upper surface, and exits the film at a point \\(P\\) on the lower surface. The horizontal distance traveled is \\(OP = 2S\\).\n    2.  **Beam 2:** An adjacent parallel beam that is incident on the film at point \\(P(2S, 0)\\).\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the phase difference \\(\\varphi\\) between Beam 1 as it exits at \\(P\\) and Beam 2 as it is about to enter at \\(P\\).\n*   **Assumptions:** Any phase change that might occur upon reflection is to be ignored. The final answer should not contain the variable \\(S\\).\n\nThe linear profile of the refractive index \\(n(y)\\) can be expressed as \\(n(y) = A + By\\). Using the boundary conditions \\(n(0)=n_a\\) and \\(n(d)=n_b\\), we find \\(A=n_a\\) and \\(B = (n_b - n_a)/d\\). Thus, the refractive index profile is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn(y) = n_a + \\frac{n_b - n_a}{d} y\n\\label{eq:n_profile} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Optical Path Difference and Phase Difference\nThe phase difference \\(\\varphi\\) is proportional to the optical path difference (OPD), \\(\\Delta L\\), between the two interfering beams. The OPD is the difference in the optical paths from a common incident wavefront to the point of interference.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\varphi = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\Delta L\n}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\Delta L = L_1 - L_2\n}\\]\nLet's choose a common incident wavefront \\(W_{in}\\) that passes through the entry point \\(O(0,0)\\) of Beam 1. Beam 2, which is incident at \\(P(2S,0)\\), intersects this wavefront at a point \\(A\\). The point of interference is \\(P\\).\nThe optical path of Beam 1, \\(L_1\\), is its path through the film from \\(O\\) to \\(P\\), which we denote as \\(L_{film}\\).\nThe optical path of Beam 2, \\(L_2\\), is its path in air from point \\(A\\) on the wavefront to point \\(P\\). We denote this as \\(L_{air}\\).\nFrom the geometry of the incident parallel beams, the path \\(AP\\) forms a right-angled triangle with the segment \\(OP\\). The length of segment \\(AP\\) is \\(|AP| = |OP| \\sin i = 2S \\sin i\\).\nThe optical path in air (\\(n_0=1\\)) is \\(L_{air} = n_0 \\cdot |AP| = 2S \\sin i\\).\nThe optical path difference is therefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta L = L_{film} - L_{air} = L_{film} - 2S \\sin i\n\\label{eq:opd_def} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Light Ray Trajectory in the Graded-Index Film\nThe path of a light ray in a medium with a continuously varying refractive index is governed by Bouguer's formula, which is a generalization of Snell's law for layered media.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\nn(y) \\sin(\\theta(y)) = \\text{constant}\n}\\]\nAt the air-film interface (\\(y=0\\)), we apply Snell's law:\n\\[\\boxed{\nn_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2\n}\\]\nApplying Snell's law at \\(y=0\\), with \\(n_1=n_0=1\\), \\(\\theta_1=i\\), \\(n_2=n(0)=n_a\\), and \\(\\theta_2=\\theta(0)\\), we get \\(1 \\cdot \\sin i = n_a \\sin(\\theta(0))\\). The constant in Bouguer's formula is determined by this initial condition. For the entire trajectory within the film:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn(y) \\sin(\\theta(y)) = n_a \\sin(\\theta(0)) = \\sin i\n\\label{eq:bouguer} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta(y)\\) is the angle the ray makes with the \\(y\\)-axis. The differential path length is \\(ds = \\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}\\). We can express \\(ds\\) and \\(dx\\) in terms of \\(dy\\) using \\(\\theta(y)\\): \\(\\tan(\\theta(y)) = dx/dy\\) and \\(ds = dy/\\cos(\\theta(y))\\). From Eq. \\eqref{eq:bouguer}, we have \\(\\sin(\\theta(y)) = \\sin i / n(y)\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos(\\theta(y)) &= \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(\\theta(y))} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\sin^2 i}{n(y)^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n(y)^2 - \\sin^2 i}}{n(y)} \\label{eq:cos_theta}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe differential elements for path length and horizontal displacement are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nds &= \\frac{dy}{\\cos(\\theta(y))} = \\frac{n(y)}{\\sqrt{n(y)^2 - \\sin^2 i}} dy \\label{eq:ds} \\\\\ndx &= \\tan(\\theta(y)) dy = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta(y))}{\\cos(\\theta(y))} dy = \\frac{\\sin i}{\\sqrt{n(y)^2 - \\sin^2 i}} dy \\label{eq:dx}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Optical Path in the Film, \\(L_{film}\\)\nThe optical path is the integral of the refractive index over the geometric path length. The total path consists of an upward journey from \\(y=0\\) to \\(y=d\\) and a downward journey from \\(y=d\\) to \\(y=0\\).

The magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is directed perpendicularly inward to the plane of motion. The problem statement provides the formula for the magnetic field as ${\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r})=\\mathbf{B}_{0}\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^{n}}$. We interpret this as the magnitude of the field, $B(r) = |\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r})| = B_0\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^{n}$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the center O. In a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$ with the origin at O and the particle's motion in the $r-\\theta$ plane, the magnetic field vector is $\\mathbf{B}(r) = -B_0\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^{n} \\hat{z}$.\n\nInitially, the particle is in a stable, uniform circular motion of radius $R$. At this radius, the magnetic field magnitude is $B(R) = B_0$. The problem states that if the particle is given a small radial disturbance, it will undergo small oscillations in the radial direction around its equilibrium circular path. We are asked to find the period, $T$, of these small radial oscillations.\n\nThe variables are:\n*   $m$: mass of the particle.\n*   $q$: charge of theparticle.\n*   $B(r)$: magnitude of the magnetic field at radius $r$.\n*   $B_0$: magnitude of the magnetic field at the equilibrium radius $R$.\n*   $R$: radius of the initial uniform circular orbit.\n*   $n$: exponent in the power-law for the magnetic field.\n*   $\\delta r$: small radial displacement from the equilibrium radius $R$.\n*   $T$: period of the small radial oscillations.\n\nWe assume the particle's velocity is non-relativistic.\n\n### Step 1: Condition for the Initial Uniform Circular Orbit\nFor the particle to move in a uniform circular orbit of radius $R$, the magnetic Lorentz force must provide the necessary centripetal force. We apply Newton's second law for the circular motion.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_L = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})}\\]\n\nIn the initial state, the motion is circular with radius $r=R$ and constant angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}_0$. The velocity is $\\vec{v}_0 = R\\dot{\\theta}_0 \\hat{\\theta}$ and the magnetic field is $\\vec{B}(R) = -B_0 \\hat{z}$. The Lorentz force is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{F}_L &= q(\\vec{v}_0 \\times \\vec{B}(R)) = q(R\\dot{\\theta}_0 \\hat{\\theta} \\times (-B_0 \\hat{z})) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -q R \\dot{\\theta}_0 B_0 (\\hat{\\theta} \\times \\hat{z}) \\label{eq:force_vec}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn a right-handed cylindrical coordinate system, the cross product of the basis vectors is $\\hat{\\theta} \\times \\hat{z} = \\hat{r}$. Substituting this into Eq. \\eqref{eq:force_vec}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{F}_L = -q R \\dot{\\theta}_0 B_0 \\hat{r} \\label{eq:force_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis force provides the centripetal force. The centripetal acceleration for uniform circular motion is $\\vec{a}_c = -R\\dot{\\theta}_0^2\\hat{r}$. Applying Newton's second law, $\\vec{F}_L = m\\vec{a}_c$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n-q R \\dot{\\theta}_0 B_0 \\hat{r} &= m (-R\\dot{\\theta}_0^2\\hat{r}) \\nonumber \\\\\nq \\dot{\\theta}_0 B_0 &= m \\dot{\\theta}_0^2 \\label{eq:force_balance}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAssuming the particle is in motion ($\\dot{\\theta}_0 \\neq 0$), we can find the angular velocity of the equilibrium orbit:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{\\theta}_0 = \\frac{q B_0}{m} \\label{eq:theta_dot_0}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNote that for the force to be centripetal (directed towards $-\\hat{r}$), we must have $q\\dot{\\theta}_0 > 0$. This means a positively charged particle ($q>0$) will orbit counter-clockwise ($\\dot{\\theta}_0>0$), and a negatively charged particle ($q<0$) will orbit clockwise ($\\dot{\\theta}_0<0$).\n\n### Step 2: Conserved Canonical Angular Momentum\nIn a non-uniform magnetic field, the mechanical angular momentum is not generally conserved. However, since the magnetic field is centrally symmetric (it only depends on $r$), the Lagrangian of the system is independent of the angular coordinate $\\theta$. This symmetry implies that the canonical momentum conjugate to $\\theta$, denoted $p_\\theta$, is a conserved quantity.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{B} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{A}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{L = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 + q \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{A} - q\\phi}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{p_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}}\\]\n\nFirst, we find a suitable magnetic vector potential $\\vec{A}$ for the field $\\vec{B} = -B(r)\\hat{z}$. For a centrally symmetric field of this form, we can assume a vector potential of the form $\\vec{A} = A_\\theta(r) \\hat{\\theta}$. In cylindrical coordinates, the curl is given by $(\\nabla \\times \\vec{A})_z = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r A_\\theta)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r A_\\theta) &= -B(r) = -B_0 \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^n \\nonumber \\\\\nd(r A_\\theta) &= -\\frac{B_0}{R^n} r^{n+1} dr \\nonumber \\\\\nr A_\\theta &= \\int -\\frac{B_0}{R^n} r^{n+1} dr = -\\frac{B_0}{R^n} \\frac{r^{n+2}}{n+2} + C\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe integration constant $C$ can be set to zero by a choice of gauge, so we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nA_\\theta(r) = -\\frac{B_0 r^{n+1}}{(n+2)R^n} \\label{eq:A_theta}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWith no electric field ($\\phi=0$), the Lagrangian in cylindrical coordinates is $L = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\theta}^2) + q(r\\dot{\\theta})A_\\theta(r)$. Since $L$ does not explicitly depend on $\\theta$, the corresponding canonical momentum $p_\\theta$ is conserved.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_\\theta &= \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = mr^2\\dot{\\theta} + q r A_\\theta(r) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= mr^2\\dot{\\theta} - \\frac{q B_0 r^{n+2}}{(n+2)R^n} \\label{eq:p_theta}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe evaluate this constant of motion using the initial conditions of the circular orbit: $r=R$ and $\\dot{\\theta}_0 = qB_0/m$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:theta_dot_0}.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_\\theta &= m R^2 \\left(\\frac{qB_0}{m}\\right) - \\frac{q B_0 R^{n+2}}{(n+2)R^n} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= qB_0R^2 - \\frac{qB_0R^2}{n+2} = qB_0R^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n+2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= qB_0R^2 \\frac{n+1}{n+2} \\label{eq:p_theta_const}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Effective Potential for Radial Motion\nThe magnetic force does no work, so the total kinetic energy of the particle is conserved. We can express this energy in terms of the radial coordinate and its time derivative to find an effective potential for the radial motion.\n\n\\[\\boxed{E = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 = \\text{constant}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{E = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{r}^2 + U_{\\text{eff}}(r)}\\]\n\nThe kinetic energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + (r\\dot{\\theta})^2) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{(mr^2\\dot{\\theta})^2}{2mr^2}$. The term $L_z = mr^2\\dot{\\theta}$ is the mechanical angular momentum. From Eq. \\eqref{eq:p_theta}, we can express $L_z$ as a function of $r$ and the conserved quantity $p_\\theta$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL_z(r) = mr^2\\dot{\\theta} = p_\\theta - q r A_\\theta(r) = p_\\theta + \\frac{q B_0 r^{n+2}}{(n+2)R^n} \\label{eq:L_z_of_r}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the value of $p_\\theta$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:p_theta_const}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL_z(r) = qB_0R^2 \\frac{n+1}{n+2} + \\frac{q B_0 r^{n+2}}{(n+2)R^n} \\label{eq:L_z_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe total energy can be written as $E = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L_z(r)^2}{2mr^2}$. The effective potential for the radial motion is the part of the energy that depends on $r$ but not on $\\dot{r}$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU_{\\text{eff}}(r) = \\frac{L_z(r)^2}{2mr^2} = \\frac{1}{2mr^2} \\left( qB_0R^2 \\frac{n+1}{n+2} + \\frac{q B_0 r^{n+2}}{(n+2)R^n} \\right)^2 \\label{eq:Ueff}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Equation for Small Radial Oscillations\nSmall oscillations occur around a stable equilibrium point. The condition for equilibrium is that the net radial force is zero, which corresponds to an extremum of the effective potential. For stable equilibrium, this must be a minimum. The effective spring constant for small oscillations is given by the second derivative of the potential at the equilibrium radius.\n\n\\[\\boxed{F_{\\text{eff}}(r) = -\\frac{dU_{\\text{eff}}}{dr}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{k_{\\text{eff}} = \\left.\\frac{d^2U_{\\text{eff}}}{dr^2}\\right|_{r=R}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{m\\ddot{\\delta r} + k_{\\text{eff}}\\delta r = 0}\\]\n\nThe radial motion is governed by $m\\ddot{r} = F_{\\text{eff}}(r)$. For small displacements $\\delta r = r-R$ from equilibrium, the equation of motion approximates to simple harmonic motion: $m\\ddot{\\delta r} = -k_{\\text{eff}}\\delta r$. We calculate $k_{\\text{eff}}$ by finding the second derivative of $U_{\\text{eff}}(r)$ at $r=R$.\nFirst, we find the first derivative of $U_{\\text{eff}}(r) = \\frac{L_z(r)^2}{2mr^2}$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dU_{\\text{eff}}}{dr} = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left( \\frac{2L_z(r)L_z'(r)}{r^2} - \\frac{2L_z(r)^2}{r^3} \\right) = \\frac{L_z(r)}{mr^3} \\left(r L_z'(r) - L_z(r)\\right) \\label{eq:dUeff_dr}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAt equilibrium, this derivative must be zero. Let's verify this at $r=R$. From Eq. \\eqref{eq:L_z_final}, we have $L_z'(r) = \\frac{qB_0 r^{n+1}}{R^n}$. At $r=R$, $L_z'(R) = qB_0R$. Also at $r=R$, $L_z(R) = qB_0R^2 \\frac{n+1}{n+2} + \\frac{qB_0R^2}{n+2} = qB_0R^2$. Thus, $R L_z'(R) - L_z(R) = R(qB_0R) - qB_0R^2 = 0$, confirming that $r=R$ is an equilibrium point.\n\nNow we compute the second derivative. Using the product rule on Eq. \\eqref{eq:dUeff_dr}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d^2U_{\\text{eff}}}{dr^2} = \\left(\\frac{d}{dr}\\frac{L_z(r)}{mr^3}\\right) \\left[r L_z'(r) - L_z(r)\\right] + \\frac{L_z(r)}{mr^3} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[r L_z'(r) - L_z(r)\\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEvaluating at $r=R$, the first term vanishes because the factor in the square brackets is zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk_{\\text{eff}} = \\left.\\frac{d^2U_{\\text{eff}}}{dr^2}\\right|_{r=R} = \\frac{L_z(R)}{mR^3} \\left. \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[r L_z'(r) - L_z(r)\\right] \\right|_{r=R}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLet's compute the derivative of the term in the brackets: $\\frac{d}{dr}\\left[r L_z'(r) - L_z(r)\\right] = (L_z'(r) + rL_z''(r)) - L_z'(r) = rL_z''(r)$.\nSo, $k_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{L_z(R)}{mR^3} \\left(R L_z''(R)\\right) = \\frac{L_z(R)L_z''(R)}{mR^2}$.\nWe need the second derivative of $L_z(r)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL_z''(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(L_z'(r)\\right) = \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{qB_0}{R^n}r^{n+1}\\right) = \\frac{qB_0(n+1)}{R^n}r^n\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEvaluating at $r=R$: $\\left.L_z''(R)\\right|_{r=R} = qB_0(n+1)$.\nSubstituting the values for $L_z(R)$ and $L_z''(R)$ into the expression for $k_{\\text{eff}}$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk_{\\text{eff}} &= \\frac{(qB_0R^2) \\cdot (qB_0(n+1))}{mR^2} = \\frac{q^2 B_0^2 (n+1)}{m} \\label{eq:keff}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Period of Oscillation\nThe equation for small radial oscillations is $m\\ddot{\\delta r} + k_{\\text{eff}}\\delta r = 0$, which describes simple harmonic motion. The period of oscillation is determined by the mass and the effective spring constant.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}}\\]\n\nFor stable oscillations to occur, the effective spring constant $k_{\\text{eff}}$ must be positive. Since $m, q^2, B_0^2$ are all positive, this requires $n+1 > 0$, or $n > -1$. This is the condition for weak focusing, ensuring the magnetic field does not decrease too rapidly with radius.\nThe angular frequency $\\omega$ of the radial oscillations is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega^2 &= \\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}}{m} = \\frac{1}{m} \\left(\\frac{q^2 B_0^2 (n+1)}{m}\\right) = \\frac{q^2 B_0^2 (n+1)}{m^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\omega &= \\sqrt{\\frac{q^2 B_0^2 (n+1)}{m^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{q^2} B_0}{m} \\sqrt{n+1} = \\frac{|q| B_0}{m} \\sqrt{n+1} \\label{eq:omega}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe period of oscillation $T$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nT = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = \\frac{2\\pi m}{|q| B_0 \\sqrt{n+1}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{n+1}}\\frac{m}{|q| B_{0}} \\label{eq:period}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe period of the small radial oscillations is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{n+1}}\\frac{m}{|q| B_{0}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

They all pass through the \"poles\" at (0, 0, R) and (0, 0, -R).\n*   The planes of these rings are distributed symmetrically around the z-axis, with the angle between the planes of any two adjacent rings being `π/n`.\n\n**Test Particle and its Motion:**\n*   A particle of mass `m` and negative charge `-q` (where `q` is a positive value) is introduced into the system.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a stable circular orbit of radius `r_0` in the equatorial plane (the xy-plane, where z=0).\n*   A key assumption is that the orbital radius is much larger than the ring radius, i.e., `r_0 \\gg R`. This suggests that a multipole expansion of the electric potential is appropriate and that we can use approximations for `R/r_0 \\ll 1`.\n*   The particle is then given a small radial disturbance, causing it to oscillate radially around its stable orbit while it continues to revolve.\n\n**Objective:**\n*   The goal is to find the difference between the period of the radial oscillations, `T_r`, and the period of the angular revolution (the orbital period), `T_θ`.\n\n**Constants:**\n*   The vacuum permittivity is denoted by `ε_0`.\n\n### Step 1: Electric Potential of a Single Charged Ring\nWe begin by finding the electric potential `V_1` created by a single charged ring at a point far from the ring (`r \\gg R`). For a charge distribution with axial symmetry, like a ring, the potential `V(r, α)` at a point `(r, α)` (in spherical coordinates relative to the ring's axis) can be expressed using a multipole expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials `P_l(\\cos\\alpha)`.\n\\[\n\\boxed{V(r, \\alpha) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_l}{r^{l+1}} P_l(\\cos\\alpha)}\n\\]\nHere, `a_l = \\int (r')^l P_l(\\cos\\theta') \\rho(\\mathbf{r'}) d\\tau'` are the multipole moments.

They are connected by a single light, inextensible rope that runs over two smooth, fixed pulleys, B and C. The pulleys are positioned at the same horizontal level. Object A hangs from pulley B and can swing like a pendulum, while object D hangs from pulley C, acting as a counterweight.\n\nThe variables and constants are defined as follows:\n*   $m$: The mass of object A and object D.\n*   $g$: The acceleration due to gravity.\n*   $x(t)$: The length of the rope segment AB, which acts as the length of the pendulum. This is a dynamic variable.\n*   $\\theta(t)$: The angle of the pendulum segment AB with respect to the vertical. This is a dynamic variable.\n*   $x_0$: The initial length of the pendulum, i.e., $x(0) = x_0$.\n*   $\\theta_0$: The initial angle of the pendulum, which is small.\n*   $L$: The initial length of the rope segment CD. It is stated to be sufficiently large to ensure object D does not interfere with pulley C.\n*   $\\Theta(x)$: The amplitude of the angular oscillation, which depends on the pendulum length $x$.\n\nThe system is subject to the following initial conditions at time $t=0$:\n*   The system is released from rest.\n*   The initial angle is $\\theta(0) = \\theta_0$. Since the system starts from rest, this is the initial amplitude of oscillation.\n*   The initial angular velocity is $\\dot{\\theta}(0) = 0$.\n*   The initial radial velocity is $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$.\n\nKey assumptions for the model are:\n1.  The pulleys B and C are smooth (frictionless) and their size is negligible (point-like).\n2.  The rope is massless and inextensible. Its total length is constant.\n3.  The initial angle $\\theta_0$ is small, and the angle $\\theta(t)$ remains small throughout the motion. This allows for approximations such as $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1 - \\theta^2/2$.\n4.  The problem states that \"A descends very slowly\". This is interpreted as an adiabatic process: the characteristic time scale for the change in the pendulum length $x$ is much larger than the period of the pendulum's angular oscillation. This allows us to treat $x$ as a slowly varying parameter when analyzing the $\\theta$ motion.\n\nThe objective is to find the amplitude of the oscillation angle, $\\Theta$, as a function of the pendulum length $x$.\n\n### Step 1: Lagrangian of the System\nTo describe the dynamics of the system, we use the Lagrangian formalism.

The setup involves a sodium lamp as the light source, and the blurring is caused by the thermal motion of the light-emitting atoms.\n\n**Given Information and Physical Process:**\n*   **Experimental Setup:** A standard Young's double-slit apparatus with a separation between the slits of `d` and a distance to the screen of `L`. We assume the far-field condition (`L \\gg d`) holds and the width of the slits themselves is negligible.\n*   **Light Source:** A sodium lamp operating at a temperature `T`. The mass of a single sodium atom is `m`. The atoms in the lamp are in thermal motion, and their velocities follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\n*   **Filtering:** A filter is used to isolate a single spectral line of the sodium lamp, which has a central wavelength of `\\lambda_2`.\n*   **Blurring Mechanisms:** The problem statement introduces two distinct concepts related to fringe blurring:\n    1.  **Two-Wavelength Interference:** It first mentions the sodium double yellow lines (`\\lambda_1`, `\\lambda_2`) and defines a contrast function `\\gamma`. Blurring occurs when `\\gamma=0`. This happens when the maxima of one wavelength's pattern fall on the minima of the other's. However, since the problem specifies that a filter is used to select only the `\\lambda_2` light, this mechanism is not relevant to the final question.\n    2.  **Thermal Broadening:** The relevant mechanism is the broadening of the single spectral line `\\lambda_2` due to the Doppler effect from the thermal motion of the sodium atoms. This causes a continuous spectrum of wavelengths around `\\lambda_2` to be present, leading to a gradual loss of fringe contrast (visibility) as one moves away from the center of the screen.\n*   **Blurring Criterion:** The condition for blurring is given as: \"if the background light intensity becomes 1/e of the system's maximum possible light intensity\". This is an unconventional statement. In the context of coherence and interference from a broadened spectral line, the clarity of fringes is described by the visibility function, `V(x)`, which acts as a multiplicative envelope on the ideal interference pattern. A standard and physically meaningful criterion for the loss of coherence is when this visibility envelope drops to `1/e` of its maximum value. We will interpret the problem's condition in this standard way. Since the maximum visibility is `V(0) = 1` at the center of the pattern, the condition for blurring becomes `V(x) = 1/e`.\n\n**Variables and Constants:**\n*   `d`: The distance between the two slits.\n*   `L`: The distance from the slits to the screen.\n*   `x`: The horizontal position on the screen, measured from the central maximum.\n*   `\\lambda_2`: The central wavelength of the filtered sodium light.\n*   `T`: The temperature of the sodium lamp.\n*   `m`: The mass of a sodium atom.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in vacuum.\n*   `k_B`: The Boltzmann constant (denoted as `k` in the final answer).\n*   `k_0 = 2\\pi/\\lambda_2`: The central wave number of the light.\n\n**Goal:**\nTo calculate the position `x` on the screen where the fringes first become blurred, based on the thermal broadening effect and the interpreted blurring criterion.\n\n### Step 1: Intensity from a Single Atom and the Doppler Shift\nFirst, we determine the intensity pattern produced by a single atom. The atom's motion along the line of sight (z-axis) causes a Doppler shift in the emitted light's wave number.\n\n\\[\\boxed{I(x, k) = 2I_1 (1 + \\cos(\\Delta\\phi))}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\Delta\\phi = k \\Delta r}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\Delta r \\approx \\frac{dx}{L}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{k = k_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{v_z}{c}\\right)}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nThe intensity pattern for monochromatic light with wave number `k` in a Young's double-slit experiment is given by the first formula, where `I_1` is the intensity from a single slit and `\\Delta\\phi` is the phase difference. The phase difference depends on the wave number `k` and the path difference `\\Delta r`. In the far-field approximation (`L \\gg d`), the path difference to a point `x` on the screen is `\\Delta r \\approx dx/L`. The atom's velocity component `v_z` along the line of sight causes a non-relativistic Doppler shift in the wave number, from `k_0` (for a stationary atom) to `k`. Combining these, we find the intensity pattern produced by a single atom moving with velocity `v_z`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nI(x, v_z) &= 2I_1 \\left(1 + \\cos\\left(k \\frac{dx}{L}\\right)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2I_1 \\left(1 + \\cos\\left(k_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{v_z}{c}\\right) \\frac{dx}{L}\\right)\\right) \\label{eq:single_atom_I} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Intensity from All Atoms\nThe light from different atoms in the lamp is incoherent. Therefore, the total intensity on the screen is the sum (integral) of the intensities from all atoms, weighted by their velocity distribution.\n\n\\[\\boxed{I_{total}(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} I(x, v_z) f(v_z) dv_z}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{f(v_z) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}} e^{-\\frac{m v_z^2}{2 k_B T}}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nWe substitute the single-atom intensity from Eq. \\eqref{eq:single_atom_I} and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution `f(v_z)` for the velocity component `v_z` into the integral for total intensity. Let `C = 2I_1` be a constant.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nI_{total}(x) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C \\left(1 + \\cos\\left(k_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{v_z}{c}\\right) \\frac{dx}{L}\\right)\\right) f(v_z) dv_z \\nonumber \\\\\n&= C \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(v_z) dv_z + C \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx}{L} + \\frac{k_0 dx v_z}{Lc}\\right) f(v_z) dv_z \\label{eq:total_I_integral} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe first term is `C \\int f(v_z) dv_z = C` because `f(v_z)` is a normalized probability distribution. For the second term, we use the identity `\\cos(A+B) = \\cos A \\cos B - \\sin A \\sin B`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{Integral}_2 &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx v_z}{Lc}\\right) - \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx v_z}{Lc}\\right)\\right] f(v_z) dv_z \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\cos\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx}{L}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx v_z}{Lc}\\right) f(v_z) dv_z - \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx}{L}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx v_z}{Lc}\\right) f(v_z) dv_z \\label{eq:integral_expanded} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe velocity distribution `f(v_z)` is an even function of `v_z`. The `\\sin` function is odd. Therefore, the product `\\sin(...)f(v_z)` is an odd function, and its integral over the symmetric interval `(-\\infty, \\infty)` is zero. The total intensity thus simplifies to:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nI_{total}(x) = C \\left( 1 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx}{L}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx v_z}{Lc}\\right) f(v_z) dv_z \\right) \\label{eq:I_with_V_integral} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Fringe Visibility Function\nThe total intensity pattern consists of a rapidly oscillating cosine term (the fringes) multiplied by a slowly varying envelope. This envelope function is the fringe visibility, `V(x)`.\n\n\\[\\boxed{I_{total}(x) = I_{avg} \\left(1 + V(x) \\cos\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx}{L}\\right)\\right)}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-av^2}\\cos(bv)dv = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}e^{-b^2/(4a)}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nBy comparing our derived intensity in Eq. \\eqref{eq:I_with_V_integral} with the general form, we can identify the average intensity `I_{avg} = C` and the visibility function `V(x)` as the integral:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nV(x) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx v_z}{Lc}\\right) f(v_z) dv_z \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{m v_z^2}{2 k_B T}} \\cos\\left(\\left(\\frac{k_0 dx}{Lc}\\right)v_z\\right) dv_z \\label{eq:visibility_integral} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis is a standard definite integral (the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function). We apply the formula with parameters `a = \\frac{m}{2k_B T}` and `b = \\frac{k_0 dx}{Lc}`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nV(x) &= \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{m/(2k_B T)}} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(k_0 dx/Lc)^2}{4(m/(2k_B T))}\\right] \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{m}} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{k_0^2 d^2 x^2}{L^2 c^2} \\frac{2k_B T}{4m}\\right] \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_0^2 d^2 x^2 k_B T}{2 m L^2 c^2}\\right) \\label{eq:visibility_result} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe visibility function is a Gaussian that decays with distance `x` from the center.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Blurring Condition and Solving for x\nWe now apply the condition for blurring, which we interpreted as the visibility dropping to `1/e`.\n\n\\[\\boxed{V(x) = \\frac{1}{e}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nWe set the derived visibility function from Eq. \\eqref{eq:visibility_result} equal to `1/e`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_0^2 d^2 x^2 k_B T}{2 m L^2 c^2}\\right) &= \\frac{1}{e} = e^{-1} \\label{eq:blur_condition} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFor this equality to hold, the exponents must be equal:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{k_0^2 d^2 x^2 k_B T}{2 m L^2 c^2} &= 1 \\label{eq:exponent_equated} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for `x`. We take the positive root, as `x` represents a distance.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx^2 &= \\frac{2 m L^2 c^2}{k_0^2 d^2 k_B T} \\nonumber \\\\\nx &= \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m L^2 c^2}{k_0^2 d^2 k_B T}} \\nonumber \\\\\nx &= \\frac{Lc\\sqrt{2m}}{k_0 d \\sqrt{k_B T}} \\label{eq:x_solved} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFinally, we substitute the expression for the central wave number, `k_0 = 2\\pi/\\lambda_2`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx &= \\frac{Lc\\sqrt{2m}}{(2\\pi/\\lambda_2) d \\sqrt{k_B T}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{Lc\\lambda_2\\sqrt{2m}}{2\\pi d \\sqrt{k_B T}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{Lc\\lambda_2}{2\\pi d} \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{k_B T}} \\label{eq:final_x} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFor the final answer, we use `k` to represent the Boltzmann constant `k_B` as is common.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe position `x` where the fringes become blurred for the first time is given by:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{Lc\\lambda_2}{2\\pi d} \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{kT}}}\n\\end{align}\\]"}

A particle of mass $m$ and charge $-q$ (where $q > 0$) is intended to be held in stable equilibrium at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y,z)$. The confinement is provided by the electromagnetic field generated by two identical rings.\n\nEach ring has a radius $R$ and carries a uniformly distributed total charge $Q_0$ (where $Q_0 > 0$). The rings are parallel to the $xy$-plane and are centered on the $z$-axis. One ring is located at the plane $z=l$ and the other at $z=-l$. Both rings rotate with a constant angular velocity $\\Omega$ about the $z$-axis.\n\nThe task is to find the minimum angular velocity, $\\Omega_{min}$, required for the particle's equilibrium at the origin to be stable against small displacements in all directions (both along the $z$-axis and in the radial direction $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$).\n\nThe given physical constants and variables are:\n*   $m$: mass of the particle.\n*   $-q$: charge of the particle ($q>0$).\n*   $R$: radius of the rings.\n*   $Q_0$: charge of each ring ($Q_0>0$).\n*   $l$: the magnitude of the z-coordinate of each ring's plane.\n*   $\\Omega$: the angular velocity of the rings.\n*   $\\epsilon_0$: the vacuum permittivity.\n*   $\\mu_0$: the vacuum permeability.\n\nWe make the following assumptions:\n*   The particle's motion is non-relativistic.\n*   Retarded potentials are neglected, which is valid for slow changes in the fields or small system size compared to the relevant wavelengths.\n*   We analyze the stability for small displacements $(r, z)$ from the origin, allowing us to use Taylor expansions of the fields and potentials.\n\n### Step 1: Electrostatic Potential and Energy near the Origin\nFirst, we determine the electrostatic potential energy of the particle near the origin. The electrostatic potential $V_E$ at a point $\\mathbf{r}$ due to a charge distribution is found by integrating over the source charges. For the two rings, the potential on the z-axis at a point $(0,0,z)$ is the sum of the potentials from each ring.\n\\[\n\\boxed{V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{dq'}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}|}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_E(0,0,z) = \\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R^2 + (z-l)^2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R^2 + (z+l)^2}} \\right) \\label{eq:V_on_axis}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe potential energy of the particle with charge $-q$ is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{U_E = (-q) V_E}\n\\]\nTo analyze stability at the origin, we expand the potential energy $U_E$ in a Taylor series for small displacements $(r, z)$. Due to the axial symmetry, the first derivatives of $V_E$ at the origin are zero. The expansion up to second order is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_E(r,z) \\approx V_E(0,0) + \\frac{1}{2}z^2 \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial z^2}\\right|_{(0,0)} + \\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial r^2}\\right|_{(0,0)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn the charge-free region around the origin, the potential satisfies Laplace's equation.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\nabla^2 V_E = \\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial z^2} = 0}\n\\]\nBy axial symmetry, at the origin, $\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial x^2}\\right|_{(0,0)} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_{(0,0)}$. We can identify this common value with $\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial r^2}\\right|_{(0,0)}$. Thus, Laplace's equation at the origin implies $2\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial r^2}\\right|_{(0,0)} + \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial z^2}\\right|_{(0,0)} = 0$, which gives $\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial r^2}\\right|_{(0,0)} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial z^2}\\right|_{(0,0)}$.\n\nWe calculate the second derivative of $V_E$ with respect to $z$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:V_on_axis}. The first derivative is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial V_E}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{z-l}{(R^2 + (z-l)^2)^{3/2}} + \\frac{z+l}{(R^2 + (z+l)^2)^{3/2}} \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe second derivative, evaluated at the origin $(z=0)$, is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial z^2}\\right|_{(0,0)} &= -\\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{(R^2+l^2)^{3/2}} - \\frac{3(-l)^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} + \\frac{1}{(R^2+l^2)^{3/2}} - \\frac{3(l)^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} \\right] \\\\\n&= -\\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{2}{(R^2+l^2)^{3/2}} - \\frac{6l^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} \\right] = -\\frac{Q_0}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(R^2+l^2) - 3l^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{Q_0}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2l^2-R^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} \\label{eq:d2Vdz2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe electrostatic potential energy near the origin is then:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU_E(r,z) &\\approx U_E(0,0) - q \\left( \\frac{1}{2}z^2 \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial z^2}\\right|_{(0,0)} + \\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial z^2}\\right|_{(0,0)}\\right) \\right) \\\\\n&= U_E(0,0) - \\frac{q}{2} z^2 \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial z^2}\\right|_{(0,0)} + \\frac{q}{4} r^2 \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 V_E}{\\partial z^2}\\right|_{(0,0)} \\\\\n&= U_E(0,0) + \\frac{qQ_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{R^2-2l^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} z^2 + \\frac{qQ_0}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2l^2-R^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} r^2 \\label{eq:UE_expanded}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Axial Stability Condition\nThe stability of the particle at the origin is determined by the net force on it. The total force is the Lorentz force, $\\vec{F} = -q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$. For a small displacement purely along the $z$-axis, the velocity is $\\vec{v} = v_z \\hat{z}$. The magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ produced by the rotating rings is directed along the $z$-axis on the axis itself. Thus, the magnetic force is $\\vec{F}_B = -q(v_z \\hat{z} \\times B_z \\hat{z}) = 0$. Stability in the $z$-direction is governed solely by the electrostatic force.\nFor stable equilibrium at the origin, the potential energy must be a local minimum. This requires the second partial derivatives of the potential energy with respect to displacement coordinates to be positive.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial z^2} > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial r^2} > 0 \\quad (\\text{at the origin})}\n\\]\nFrom the expansion of $U_E$ in Eq. \\eqref{eq:UE_expanded}, the condition for stability in the $z$-direction is that the coefficient of $z^2$ must be positive.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{qQ_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{R^2-2l^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} > 0 \\label{eq:z_stability_condition}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince $q, Q_0, \\epsilon_0$ are all positive, this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nR^2 - 2l^2 > 0 \\implies R^2 > 2l^2 \\label{eq:R_l_relation}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIf this condition holds, the coefficient of $r^2$ in Eq. \\eqref{eq:UE_expanded}, which is $\\frac{qQ_0}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2l^2-R^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}}$, becomes negative. This means the electrostatic force is repulsive in the radial direction, creating an unstable equilibrium. This is an illustration of Earnshaw's theorem. The magnetic field must provide the necessary radial confinement.\n\n### Step 3: Magnetic Field at the Origin\nThe two rotating rings create a magnetic field. Each ring acts as a circular current loop. The current $I$ is the total charge $Q_0$ divided by the period of rotation $T=2\\pi/\\Omega$.\n\\[\n\\boxed{I = \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{Q_0}{T}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI = \\frac{Q_0 \\Omega}{2\\pi}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe magnetic field on the axis of a single current loop of radius $R$ at a distance $z'$ from its center is given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B_z(z') = \\frac{\\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + z'^2)^{3/2}}}\n\\]\nThe total magnetic field at the origin $(z=0)$ is the sum of the fields from the ring at $z=l$ (for which the distance is $l$) and the ring at $z=-l$ (for which the distance is also $l$).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nB_0 = B_z(0) &= \\frac{\\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + l^2)^{3/2}} + \\frac{\\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + l^2)^{3/2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mu_0 I R^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{Q_0 \\Omega}{2\\pi}\\right) R^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{3/2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mu_0 Q_0 \\Omega R^2}{2\\pi(R^2+l^2)^{3/2}} \\label{eq:B0}\n\\end{align}\nFor small displacements, we can approximate the magnetic field near the origin as uniform, $\\vec{B} \\approx B_0 \\hat{z}$.\n\n### Step 4: Effective Potential for Radial Motion\nTo analyze the combined effect of electrostatic and magnetic forces, we use the Lagrangian formalism. The Lagrangian for a particle with charge $q'$ in an electromagnetic field is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\mathcal{L} = T - U_{gen} = \\frac{1}{2}m\\vec{v}^2 - q'V_E + q'\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{A}}\n\\]\nHere, $T$ is the kinetic energy, $V_E$ is the electrostatic potential, and $\\vec{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential. For our particle, $q'=-q$. For the uniform field $\\vec{B} \\approx B_0 \\hat{z}$, a suitable vector potential is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{A} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{B} \\times \\vec{r})}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{A} = \\frac{1}{2}(B_0 \\hat{z} \\times (x\\hat{x}+y\\hat{y})) = \\frac{1}{2}B_0(x\\hat{y}-y\\hat{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}B_0 r \\hat{\\phi}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe Lagrangian for the particle ($q'=-q$) in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\phi, z)$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{L} &= \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 + \\dot{z}^2) - (-q)V_E(r,z) + (-q)(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{A}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 + \\dot{z}^2) + qV_E(r,z) - q(\\frac{1}{2}B_0 r^2 \\dot{\\phi})\n\\end{align}\nThe coordinate $\\phi$ is cyclic (does not appear in $\\mathcal{L}$), so its conjugate momentum $p_\\phi$ is conserved.\n\\[\n\\boxed{p_\\phi = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}} = \\text{constant}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_\\phi = m r^2 \\dot{\\phi} - \\frac{1}{2}qB_0 r^2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe particle is given a small disturbance from rest at the origin, so its initial canonical angular momentum is $p_\\phi = 0$. By conservation, $p_\\phi$ remains zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm r^2 \\dot{\\phi} - \\frac{1}{2}qB_0 r^2 = 0 \\implies \\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{qB_0}{2m}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe total energy $E = T + U_E = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 - qV_E$ is conserved. We define an effective potential for the $r$ and $z$ motion by substituting the expression for $\\dot{\\phi}$ into the energy.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE &= \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + \\dot{z}^2) + \\frac{1}{2}m r^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2 - qV_E(r,z) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + \\dot{z}^2) + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2}m r^2 \\left(\\frac{qB_0}{2m}\\right)^2 - qV_E(r,z)}_{V_{eff}(r,z)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe effective potential energy is $V_{eff}(r,z) = \\frac{q^2 B_0^2}{8m}r^2 - qV_E(r,z)$. Since $U_E = -qV_E$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_{eff}(r,z) = \\frac{q^2 B_0^2}{8m}r^2 + U_E(r,z) \\label{eq:Veff_form}\n\\end{align}\nSubstituting the expansion for $U_E$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:UE_expanded}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_{eff}(r,z) \\approx V_0 + \\left[ \\frac{q^2 B_0^2}{8m} + \\frac{qQ_0}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2l^2-R^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} \\right] r^2 + \\left[ \\frac{qQ_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{R^2-2l^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} \\right] z^2 \\label{eq:Veff_full}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $V_0 = U_E(0,0)$ is a constant potential offset.\n\n### Step 5: Minimum Angular Velocity for Stability\nFor the particle to be stable at the origin, the effective potential energy $V_{eff}$ must have a local minimum. This requires the coefficients of both $r^2$ and $z^2$ in Eq. \\eqref{eq:Veff_full} to be positive.\n1.  **z-stability**: The coefficient of $z^2$ must be positive, which requires $R^2 > 2l^2$, as shown in Step 2.\n2.  **r-stability**: The coefficient of $r^2$ must be positive.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{q^2 B_0^2}{8m} + \\frac{qQ_0}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2l^2-R^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} > 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nGiven the z-stability condition ($R^2 > 2l^2$), the second term is negative. The magnetic term must be large enough to overcome this electrostatic repulsion.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{q^2 B_0^2}{8m} > - \\frac{qQ_0}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2l^2-R^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} = \\frac{qQ_0}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{R^2-2l^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we substitute the expression for $B_0$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:B0}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{q^2}{8m} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 Q_0 \\Omega R^2}{2\\pi(R^2+l^2)^{3/2}} \\right)^2 &> \\frac{qQ_0}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{R^2-2l^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} \\\\\n\\frac{q^2 \\mu_0^2 Q_0^2 \\Omega^2 R^4}{8m \\cdot 4\\pi^2 (R^2+l^2)^3} &> \\frac{qQ_0}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{R^2-2l^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSolving for $\\Omega^2$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Omega^2 &> \\frac{32\\pi^2 m (R^2+l^2)^3}{q^2 \\mu_0^2 Q_0^2 R^4} \\cdot \\frac{qQ_0}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{R^2-2l^2}{(R^2+l^2)^{5/2}} \\\\\n\\Omega^2 &> \\frac{4\\pi m (R^2-2l^2)(R^2+l^2)^{3 - 5/2}}{q Q_0 \\mu_0^2 \\epsilon_0 R^4} \\\\\n\\Omega^2 &> \\frac{4\\pi m (R^2-2l^2)\\sqrt{R^2+l^2}}{q Q_0 \\mu_0^2 \\epsilon_0 R^4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe minimum angular velocity $\\Omega_{min}$ is the value for which this inequality becomes an equality.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Omega_{min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi m (R^2-2l^2)\\sqrt{R^2+l^2}}{q Q_0 \\mu_0^2 \\epsilon_0 R^4}} = \\frac{2}{R^2 \\mu_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi m(R^2-2l^2)\\sqrt{R^2+l^2}}{q Q_0 \\epsilon_0}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo match the provided format, we can rearrange the factors of $\\pi$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Omega_{min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\mu_0 R^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{m(R^2-2l^2)\\sqrt{R^2+l^2}}{\\pi \\epsilon_0 q Q_0}} \\label{eq:Omega_min}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimum angular velocity $\\Omega$ required for the particle to remain stable in all directions is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\Omega_{min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\mu_{0}R^{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{m(R^{2}-2l^{2})(R^{2}+l^{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}Q_0 q}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis result is valid only under the condition for axial stability, $R^2 > 2l^2$.

The magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of motion (which we define as the z-direction) and its magnitude `B` depends only on the radial distance `r` from the center of symmetry.\n\nThe given quantities are:\n*   Particle's mass: `m`\n*   Particle's charge: `q`\n*   Magnetic field magnitude: `B(r) = B_{0} \\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{n}`, where `B_0`, `r_0`, and `n` are constants.\n\nThe physical process is as follows:\n1.  Initially, the particle executes a stable circular motion of radius `r_0` around the center of symmetry.\n2.  A small radial disturbance is applied to the particle, causing it to deviate slightly from its circular path.\n3.  The particle then undergoes small oscillations in the radial direction around the equilibrium radius `r_0`.\n\nThe objective is to find the period `T` of these small radial oscillations.\n\nWe will use a cylindrical coordinate system `(r, \\theta, z)`. The particle's motion is confined to the `z=0` plane. Its position vector is `\\vec{r}(t) = r(t)\\hat{r}(t)`, its velocity is `\\vec{v} = \\dot{r}\\hat{r} + r\\dot{\\theta}\\hat{\\theta}`, and its acceleration is `\\vec{a} = (\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2)\\hat{r} + (r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta})\\hat{\\theta}`. We assume the given form of the magnetic field is valid in the region of motion.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Initial Circular Orbit\nFirst, we establish the conditions for the initial stable circular orbit at `r = r_0`. For a circular orbit, the radius is constant, so `r(t) = r_0`, which implies `\\dot{r} = 0` and `\\ddot{r} = 0`. The angular velocity is also constant, `\\dot{\\theta}(t) = \\dot{\\theta}_0`. The particle's velocity is purely tangential, `\\vec{v}_0 = r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0 \\hat{\\theta}`, and its acceleration is purely centripetal, `\\vec{a}_0 = -r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0^2 \\hat{r}`. The magnetic Lorentz force provides this centripetal force.\n\nThe motion is governed by Newton's second law and the Lorentz force law.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{m} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})}\\]\nIn a right-handed cylindrical coordinate system, the cross product of the basis vectors follows the relation:\n\\[\\boxed{\\hat{\\theta} \\times \\hat{z} = \\hat{r}}\\]\nAt the orbit radius `r=r_0`, the magnetic field is `\\vec{B}(r_0) = B_0 \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_0}\\right)^n \\hat{z} = B_0 \\hat{z}`. We apply the Lorentz force law to find the force on the particle in its circular orbit.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{F}_{m,0} &= q(\\vec{v}_0 \\times \\vec{B}(r_0)) = q(r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0 \\hat{\\theta} \\times B_0 \\hat{z}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= q r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0 B_0 (\\hat{\\theta} \\times \\hat{z}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= q r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0 B_0 \\hat{r} \\label{eq:force_orbit} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nApplying Newton's second law, `m\\vec{a}_0 = \\vec{F}_{m,0}`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm(-r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0^2 \\hat{r}) &= q r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0 B_0 \\hat{r} \\nonumber \\\\\n-m r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0^2 &= q r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0 B_0 \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAssuming `r_0 \\neq 0` and `\\dot{\\theta}_0 \\neq 0` (for a non-trivial circular motion), we can divide by `r_0 \\dot{\\theta}_0`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n-m \\dot{\\theta}_0 &= q B_0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta}_0 &= -\\frac{q B_0}{m} \\label{eq:theta_dot_0} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis equation gives the constant angular velocity of the initial circular orbit. The centripetal force must point inward (in the `- \\hat{r}` direction). From Eq. \\eqref{eq:force_orbit}, this requires `q \\dot{\\theta}_0 B_0 < 0`. Since `B_0` is a magnitude, `q \\dot{\\theta}_0 < 0`. Our result in Eq. \\eqref{eq:theta_dot_0} gives `q\\dot{\\theta}_0 = -q^2 B_0/m`, which is always negative (as `m` and `B_0` are positive, and `q^2 \\ge 0`), thus satisfying the condition for an inward-directed force.\n\n### Step 2: Lagrangian Formulation and Conserved Quantity\nTo analyze the perturbed motion, it is convenient to use the Lagrangian formalism. The canonical momentum conjugate to the angle `\\theta` is conserved due to the axial symmetry of the problem.\n\\[\\boxed{\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 + q\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{A}}\\]\nHere, `\\vec{A}` is the magnetic vector potential, which is related to the magnetic field by:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{B} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{A}}\\]\nFor an axisymmetric field `\\vec{B} = B(r)\\hat{z}`, we can choose a vector potential of the form `\\vec{A} = A_\\theta(r)\\hat{\\theta}`. The z-component of the curl in cylindrical coordinates is:\n\\[\\boxed{(\\nabla \\times \\vec{A})_z = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r A_\\theta) - \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial A_r}{\\partial \\theta}}\\]\nWith our choice of `\\vec{A}`, this simplifies to `B_z(r) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(rA_\\theta)`. We integrate this to find `A_\\theta(r)`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr A_\\theta(r) &= \\int_0^r r' B(r') dr' = \\int_0^r r' B_0 \\left(\\frac{r'}{r_0}\\right)^n dr' \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{B_0}{r_0^n} \\int_0^r (r')^{n+1} dr' = \\frac{B_0}{r_0^n} \\frac{r^{n+2}}{n+2} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis integral converges at `r'=0` if `n+1 > -1`, i.e., `n > -2`. We will later find a stricter condition for stable oscillations. Assuming `n \\neq -2`, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nA_\\theta(r) &= \\frac{B_0 r^{n+1}}{(n+2)r_0^n} \\label{eq:A_theta} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe Lagrangian in cylindrical coordinates is `\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\theta}^2) + q(r\\dot{\\theta})A_\\theta(r)`. The canonical momentum conjugate to `\\theta` is defined as:\n\\[\\boxed{P_\\theta = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}}}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_\\theta &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\theta}^2) + qr\\dot{\\theta}A_\\theta(r) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= mr^2\\dot{\\theta} + qrA_\\theta(r) \\label{eq:P_theta_general} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince the Lagrangian does not explicitly depend on `\\theta` (`\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial\\theta = 0`), `P_\\theta` is a conserved quantity by Noether's theorem.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Conserved Canonical Angular Momentum\nWe evaluate the constant value of `P_\\theta` using the initial conditions of the circular orbit (`r=r_0`, `\\dot{\\theta}=\\dot{\\theta}_0`).\n\\[\\boxed{P_\\theta = \\text{constant}}\\]\nSubstituting `r=r_0` into Eq. \\eqref{eq:A_theta} gives `A_\\theta(r_0) = \\frac{B_0 r_0}{n+2}`. Now, using the values of `\\dot{\\theta}_0` from Eq. \\eqref{eq:theta_dot_0} and `A_\\theta(r_0)` in the expression for `P_\\theta` (Eq. \\eqref{eq:P_theta_general}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_\\theta &= m r_0^2 \\dot{\\theta}_0 + q r_0 A_\\theta(r_0) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= m r_0^2 \\left(-\\frac{qB_0}{m}\\right) + q r_0 \\left(\\frac{B_0 r_0}{n+2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -qB_0 r_0^2 + \\frac{qB_0 r_0^2}{n+2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= qB_0 r_0^2 \\left(-1 + \\frac{1}{n+2}\\right) = qB_0 r_0^2 \\left(\\frac{-n-2+1}{n+2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= - \\frac{n+1}{n+2} qB_0 r_0^2 \\label{eq:P_theta_const} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is the constant value of the canonical angular momentum throughout the particle's motion.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Effective Potential for Radial Motion\nThe magnetic force does no work on the particle (`\\vec{F}_m \\cdot \\vec{v} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot \\vec{v} = 0`), so the kinetic energy of the particle is conserved.\n\\[\\boxed{E = \\text{constant}}\\]\nThe energy is purely kinetic: `E = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\theta}^2)`. We can use the conservation of `P_\\theta` to express `\\dot{\\theta}` in terms of `r`, thereby reducing the problem to a one-dimensional problem for the radial motion. From Eq. \\eqref{eq:P_theta_general} and Eq. \\eqref{eq:A_theta}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{mr^2} \\left(P_\\theta - qrA_\\theta(r)\\right) = \\frac{1}{mr^2} \\left(P_\\theta - \\frac{qB_0 r^{n+2}}{(n+2)r_0^n}\\right) \\label{eq:theta_dot_r} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the energy expression:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE &= \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mr^2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{mr^2} \\left(P_\\theta - \\frac{qB_0 r^{n+2}}{(n+2)r_0^n}\\right) \\right]^2 \\nonumber \\\\\nE &= \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{1}{2mr^2} \\left(P_\\theta - \\frac{qB_0 r^{n+2}}{(n+2)r_0^n}\\right)^2 \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis equation describes a 1D motion in the radial coordinate `r` with an effective potential `V_{eff}(r)`. Substituting the constant value of `P_\\theta` from Eq. \\eqref{eq:P_theta_const}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_{eff}(r) &= \\frac{1}{2mr^2} \\left(- \\frac{n+1}{n+2} qB_0 r_0^2 - \\frac{qB_0 r^{n+2}}{(n+2)r_0^n}\\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{q^2 B_0^2}{2m(n+2)^2 r^2} \\left((n+1)r_0^2 + \\frac{r^{n+2}}{r_0^n}\\right)^2 \\label{eq:V_eff} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Analysis of Small Radial Oscillations\nFor small radial oscillations around the equilibrium radius `r_0`, the potential energy can be approximated by a parabola. We expand `V_{eff}(r)` in a Taylor series around `r_0`.\n\\[\\boxed{V_{eff}(r_0+\\delta r) \\approx V_{eff}(r_0) + V_{eff}'(r_0)\\delta r + \\frac{1}{2}V_{eff}''(r_0)(\\delta r)^2}\\]\nLet `r = r_0 + \\delta r`, or equivalently `r = r_0(1+x)` where `x = \\delta r / r_0` is a small dimensionless quantity. We substitute this into Eq. \\eqref{eq:V_eff}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_{eff}(r) &= \\frac{q^2 B_0^2}{2m(n+2)^2 [r_0(1+x)]^2} \\left((n+1)r_0^2 + \\frac{[r_0(1+x)]^{n+2}}{r_0^n}\\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{q^2 B_0^2 r_0^2}{2m(n+2)^2} (1+x)^{-2} \\left((n+1) + (1+x)^{n+2}\\right)^2 \\label{eq:V_eff_x} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe use the binomial expansion for small `x`:\n\\[\\boxed{(1+x)^\\alpha \\approx 1 + \\alpha x + \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha-1)}{2}x^2 + \\dots}\\]\nExpanding the terms in Eq. \\eqref{eq:V_eff_x} up to order `x^2`:\n` (1+x)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2x + 3x^2 `\n` (1+x)^{n+2} \\approx 1 + (n+2)x + \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}x^2 `\nThe term in the large parenthesis in Eq. \\eqref{eq:V_eff_x} becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(n+1) + (1+x)^{n+2} &\\approx (n+1) + \\left(1 + (n+2)x + \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}x^2\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (n+2) + (n+2)x + \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}x^2 = (n+2)\\left(1 + x + \\frac{n+1}{2}x^2\\right) \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSquaring this term:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left((n+2)\\left(1 + x + \\frac{n+1}{2}x^2\\right)\\right)^2 &\\approx (n+2)^2 \\left( (1+x)^2 + 2(1+x)\\frac{n+1}{2}x^2 \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx (n+2)^2 \\left( 1+2x+x^2 + (n+1)x^2 \\right) = (n+2)^2 \\left( 1+2x+(n+2)x^2 \\right) \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expansions back into Eq. \\eqref{eq:V_eff_x}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_{eff}(r) &\\approx \\frac{q^2 B_0^2 r_0^2}{2m(n+2)^2} (1 - 2x + 3x^2) \\cdot (n+2)^2 (1 + 2x + (n+2)x^2) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{q^2 B_0^2 r_0^2}{2m} (1 - 2x + 3x^2)(1 + 2x + (n+2)x^2) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{q^2 B_0^2 r_0^2}{2m} \\left(1 + (2-2)x + ((n+2) - 4 + 3)x^2 + O(x^3)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{q^2 B_0^2 r_0^2}{2m} \\left(1 + (n+1)x^2\\right) = V_{eff}(r_0) + \\frac{q^2 B_0^2 r_0^2(n+1)}{2m} \\left(\\frac{\\delta r}{r_0}\\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= V_{eff}(r_0) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{q^2 B_0^2 (n+1)}{m}\\right) (\\delta r)^2 \\label{eq:V_eff_expanded} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe first derivative term `V_{eff}'(r_0)` is zero, as shown by the absence of a term linear in `x` or `\\delta r`, confirming that `r_0` is an equilibrium point. The potential energy for small radial displacement `\\delta r` is that of a simple harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Period of Oscillation\nThe radial motion for small displacements `\\delta r = r - r_0` is described by the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO).\n\\[\\boxed{m\\frac{d^2(\\delta r)}{dt^2} = -k(\\delta r)}\\]\nwhere `k` is the effective spring constant.

From Eq. \\eqref{eq:V_eff_expanded}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{2}k(\\delta r)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{q^2 B_0^2 (n+1)}{m}\\right) (\\delta r)^2 \\implies k = \\frac{q^2 B_0^2 (n+1)}{m} \\label{eq:k} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor stable oscillations, the restoring force must point towards equilibrium, which requires `k>0`. This implies `n+1 > 0`, or `n > -1`. This is the stability condition for radial oscillations. The period of oscillation `T` is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nT = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\frac{q^2 B_0^2 (n+1)}{m}}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m^2}{q^2 B_0^2 (n+1)}} \\nonumber \\\\\nT = \\frac{2\\pi m}{|q|B_0\\sqrt{n+1}} \\label{eq:T_final} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe period `T` of the small radial oscillations is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{T = \\frac{2\\pi m}{|q|B_0\\sqrt{n+1}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

A regular dodecahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 vertices, 30 edges, and 12 regular pentagonal faces. Each vertex is connected to three other vertices.\n\nThe resistances of the edges are specified as follows:\n*   The resistance of the edge directly connecting vertices B and C is `R_{BC,direct} = 2r`.\n*   The resistance of each of the other 29 edges is `r`.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the total equivalent resistance, which we will denote as `R_{eq}`, between the terminals B and C. We assume that the network is composed of ideal resistors and that the connecting wires have negligible resistance. As resistors are linear components, the entire network constitutes a linear circuit, allowing the use of principles like superposition.\n\n### Step 1: Network Decomposition using Superposition\nThe given network is a modification of a standard dodecahedron network where all 30 edges have a uniform resistance `r`. The edge between B and C in our problem has a resistance of `2r` instead of `r`. We can analyze this modified network by decomposing it into a standard network and a \"compensating\" resistor connected in parallel. This method is valid due to the linearity of the circuit.\n\nThe principle we use is that the admittance (reciprocal of resistance, `Y = 1/R`) of components in parallel is additive.\n\\[\\boxed{\nY_{\\text{total}} = Y_1 + Y_2 \\quad \\text{or equivalently} \\quad \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2}\n}\\]\nWe model the given edge BC with resistance `2r` as a standard edge of resistance `r` in parallel with a compensating resistor, `R_comp`. The admittance of the given edge, `Y_{BC,given} = 1/(2r)`, must equal the sum of the admittance of a standard edge, `Y_{std\\_edge} = 1/r`, and the compensating admittance, `Y_{comp} = 1/R_{comp}`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{R_{BC,direct}} &= \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{comp}}} \\label{eq:admittance_decomp} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2r} &= \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{comp}}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{comp}}} &= \\frac{1}{2r} - \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{1-2}{2r} = -\\frac{1}{2r} \\nonumber \\\\\nR_{\\text{comp}} &= -2r \\label{eq:R_comp}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis decomposition implies that the original problem is equivalent to finding the resistance of a standard dodecahedron network (where all 30 edges have resistance `r`) between adjacent vertices B and C, and then connecting this equivalent resistance in parallel with the compensating resistor `R_{comp} = -2r`.\n\nLet `R_std` be the equivalent resistance of the standard dodecahedron between adjacent vertices B and C. The total equivalent resistance `R_{eq}` of the original problem is then given by the parallel combination of `R_std` and `R_comp`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{std}}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{comp}}} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{std}}} + \\frac{1}{-2r} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{std}}} - \\frac{1}{2r} \\label{eq:total_resistance}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe next step is to calculate `R_std`.\n\n### Step 2: Resistance of a Standard Dodecahedron (`R_std`) using Symmetry and Superposition\nWe now calculate `R_std`, the resistance between adjacent vertices B and C of a standard dodecahedron where all 30 edges have resistance `r`. We use the current injection method, which relies on the principles of symmetry and superposition. The dodecahedron has `N=20` vertices and its graph is vertex-transitive, meaning the network looks the same from every vertex. This symmetry is crucial.\n\nThe fundamental principles for this step are:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\text{Superposition Principle: In a linear circuit, the total response (voltage/current) is the sum of individual responses from each source.}\n}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\text{Ohm's Law: } V = IR\n}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\text{Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL): } \\sum_{\\text{node}} I_{\\text{in}} = \\sum_{\\text{node}} I_{\\text{out}}\n}\\]\nWe construct the desired state (a total current `I_{total}` flowing from B to C) by superposing two simpler, symmetric states:\n1.  **State 1**: A current of `(N-1)I_0 = 19I_0` is injected at vertex B, and this current is extracted equally from all other `N-1=19` vertices (i.e., a current `I_0` is extracted from each of the other 19 vertices).\n2.  **State 2**: A current of `19I_0` is extracted from vertex C, and a current of `I_0` is injected into each of the other 19 vertices (including B).\n\n**Derivation for State 1:**\nIn State 1, current `19I_0` is injected at B. Due to the symmetry of the dodecahedron, the potential of any vertex depends only on its graph distance from the source vertex B. Let `V_k^{(1)}` be the potential of all vertices at distance `k` from B. Vertex B is at distance 0 (`V_0^{(1)}`), and its neighbor C is at distance 1 (`V_1^{(1)}`). We need to find `V_{BC}^{(1)} = V_B^{(1)} - V_C^{(1)} = V_0^{(1)} - V_1^{(1)}`.\nApplying KCL at vertex B, the injected current `19I_0` must flow out through its three connecting edges. Each of these edges connects to a vertex at distance 1, which, by symmetry, all have the same potential `V_1^{(1)}`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n19I_0 &= 3 \\times \\frac{V_0^{(1)} - V_1^{(1)}}{r} \\label{eq:KCL_B} \\\\\nV_0^{(1)} - V_1^{(1)} &= \\frac{19}{3} I_0 r \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus, the potential difference between B and C in State 1 is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nV_{BC}^{(1)} = V_0^{(1)} - V_1^{(1)} = \\frac{19}{3} I_0 r \\label{eq:V_BC1}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n**Derivation for State 2:**\nIn State 2, a current of `19I_0` is extracted from C (equivalent to injecting `-19I_0`). This setup is symmetric with respect to vertex C. Let `V_k^{(2)}` be the potential of vertices at distance `k` from C. Vertex C is at distance 0 (`V_0^{(2)}`), and its neighbor B is at distance 1 (`V_1^{(2)}`). We need `V_{BC}^{(2)} = V_B^{(2)} - V_C^{(2)} = V_1^{(2)} - V_0^{(2)}`.\nApplying KCL at vertex C, the injected current is `-19I_0`. This current flows out through the three edges connected to C's neighbors, which are all at potential `V_1^{(2)}`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n-19I_0 &= 3 \\times \\frac{V_0^{(2)} - V_1^{(2)}}{r} \\label{eq:KCL_C} \\\\\nV_0^{(2)} - V_1^{(2)} &= -\\frac{19}{3} I_0 r \\nonumber \\\\\nV_1^{(2)} - V_0^{(2)} &= \\frac{19}{3} I_0 r \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus, the potential difference between B and C in State 2 is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nV_{BC}^{(2)} = V_1^{(2)} - V_0^{(2)} = \\frac{19}{3} I_0 r \\label{eq:V_BC2}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n**Superposition of States:**\nBy superposing the two states, the net current at any vertex Z (not B or C) is `-I_0` (from State 1) + `I_0` (from State 2) = 0.\nThe net current injected at B is `19I_0` (State 1) + `I_0` (State 2) = `20I_0`.\nThe net current extracted from C is `I_0` (State 1) + `19I_0` (State 2) = `20I_0`.\nThis superposition is equivalent to a total current `I_{total} = 20I_0` flowing from B to C.\nThe total potential difference is the sum of the potential differences from each state:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nV_{BC} = V_{BC}^{(1)} + V_{BC}^{(2)} = \\frac{19}{3} I_0 r + \\frac{19}{3} I_0 r = \\frac{38}{3} I_0 r \\label{eq:V_BC_total}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow we can find `R_std`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nR_{\\text{std}} = \\frac{V_{BC}}{I_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{38}{3} I_0 r}{20 I_0} = \\frac{38r}{60} = \\frac{19}{30}r \\label{eq:R_std}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation of the Equivalent Resistance\nWe now combine the resistance of the standard dodecahedron `R_std` with the compensating resistor `R_comp` in parallel, as established in Step 1, to find the final equivalent resistance `R_{eq}`.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{parallel}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2}\n}\\]\nUsing our results `R_std = \\frac{19}{30}r` from eq. \\eqref{eq:R_std} and `R_comp = -2r` from eq. \\eqref{eq:R_comp} in the formula from eq. \\eqref{eq:total_resistance}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{R_{eq}} &= \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{std}}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{comp}}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\frac{19}{30}r} + \\frac{1}{-2r} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{30}{19r} - \\frac{1}{2r} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{30 \\cdot 2}{38r} - \\frac{19 \\cdot 1}{38r} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{60 - 19}{38r} = \\frac{41}{38r} \\label{eq:inv_Req}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTherefore, the equivalent resistance between B and C is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nR_{eq} = \\frac{38}{41}r \\label{eq:final_Req}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe resistance between points B and C is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{R_{BC} = \\frac{38}{41}r}\n\\end{align}\\]"}

The cylinder is placed in a medium where a sound wave is propagating. The cylinder's axis is aligned with the direction of wave propagation, which we define as the x-axis.\n\nThe given physical parameters are:\n-   $R$: The radius of the cylinder's circular faces.\n-   $h$: The height of the cylinder.\n-   $\\psi(x,t) = A\\cos(kx)\\cos(2\\pi ft)$: The displacement of particles in the medium from their equilibrium position. This mathematical form describes a one-dimensional standing wave.\n-   $A$: The amplitude of the particle displacement.\n-   $k$: The wavenumber of the sound wave.\n-   $f$: The frequency of the sound wave.\n-   $P_0$: The ambient pressure of the medium in the absence of the wave.\n-   $\\gamma$: The adiabatic index of the medium (air).\n\nSince the sound wave is oscillatory, the first-order pressure force will also be oscillatory with a time average of zero. The net, steady force arises from second-order effects and is known as the acoustic radiation force. We will calculate this time-averaged force, denoted by $F$. We assume the cylinder is located at a position $x$.\n\nWe will define the following auxiliary variables for the derivation:\n-   $\\omega = 2\\pi f$: The angular frequency of the sound wave.\n-   $S = \\pi R^2$: The cross-sectional area of the cylinder.\n-   $V = Sh = \\pi R^2 h$: The volume of the cylinder.\n-   $\\rho_0$: The ambient density of the medium.\n-   $c$: The speed of sound in the medium.\n\nWe make the following assumptions:\n1.  The cylinder is \"small,\" meaning its dimensions are much smaller than the sound wavelength $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$. This is expressed as $kh \\ll 1$ and $kR \\ll 1$. This allows us to treat the cylinder as a point-like object within the sound field.\n2.  The cylinder is rigid (incompressible) and much denser than the surrounding medium (air). Its position is considered fixed for the force calculation.\n3.  The presence of the cylinder does not significantly distort the incident sound field. This allows us to use the properties of the unperturbed wave to calculate the force.\n4.  The compressions and rarefactions in the sound wave are adiabatic processes.\n5.  The Gor'kov potential, originally derived for a spherical particle, is assumed to be applicable to our small cylinder. This is a valid approximation when the particle dimensions ($R, h$) are much smaller than the wavelength, as the force primarily depends on the particle's volume and its bulk properties (compressibility and density) rather than its specific shape.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Pressure Perturbation to Particle Displacement\nTo find the force, we first need to determine the pressure variations in the sound wave. The pressure perturbation $P_1$ (the first-order deviation from ambient pressure $P_0$) can be related to the particle displacement $\\psi$ using the fundamental equations of fluid dynamics for an acoustic wave.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Linearized Equation of Continuity (1D): } \\frac{\\partial \\rho_1}{\\partial t} + \\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x} = 0}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Adiabatic Pressure-Density Relation (Linearized): } P_1 = c^2 \\rho_1}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Definition of Particle Velocity: } v_1 = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t}}\\]\nHere, $v_1$ is the particle velocity, $P_1$ is the pressure perturbation, and $\\rho_1$ is the density perturbation, all considered first-order quantities.\n\nWe derive the relationship between $P_1$ and $\\psi$ as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial P_1}{\\partial t} &= c^2 \\frac{\\partial \\rho_1}{\\partial t} &&\\text{(Time derivative of the adiabatic relation)} \\label{eq:1} \\\\\n&= c^2 \\left( -\\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x} \\right) &&\\text{(Substituting the continuity equation)} \\label{eq:2} \\\\\n&= -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( v_1 \\right) &&\\text{(Rearranging terms)} \\label{eq:3} \\\\\n&= -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} \\right) &&\\text{(Substituting the definition of velocity)} \\label{eq:4} \\\\\n&= -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\right) &&\\text{(Swapping partial derivatives)} \\label{eq:5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIntegrating with respect to time, we get $P_1(x,t) = -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} + C(x)$. Since $P_1$ and $\\psi$ represent oscillating wave quantities, any time-independent term like $C(x)$ can be considered zero, as there should be no pressure perturbation in the absence of wave strain ($\\partial\\psi/\\partial x = 0$). Thus, we have our working relation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_1(x,t) = -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\label{eq:P1_psi_relation} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate First-Order Field Variables\nUsing the given displacement field $\\psi(x,t) = A\\cos(kx)\\cos(\\omega t)$ (where $\\omega=2\\pi f$), we can now find the explicit expressions for the first-order particle velocity $v_1$ and pressure perturbation $P_1$.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_1(x,t) &= \\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ A\\cos(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -A\\omega\\cos(kx)\\sin(\\omega t) \\label{eq:v1_calc} \\tag{7} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ A\\cos(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\right] = -Ak\\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\label{eq:dpsi_dx_calc} \\tag{8} \\\\\nP_1(x,t) &= -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = -\\rho_0 c^2 \\left[ -Ak\\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\rho_0 c^2 A k \\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\label{eq:P1_calc} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: The Acoustic Radiation Force and Gor'kov Potential\nThe time-averaged force on a small object in a sound field, the acoustic radiation force, is conservative and can be derived from an effective potential energy field, $U(x)$, known as the Gor'kov potential.\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Force from Potential: } F = -\\frac{dU}{dx}}\\]\nThe general form of the Gor'kov potential for a small particle of volume $V$ is given in terms of the time-averaged energy densities of the unperturbed sound field.\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Gor'kov Potential (General Form): } U = V \\left( f_1 \\langle E_p \\rangle - f_2 \\langle E_k \\rangle \\right)}\\]\nwhere $\\langle E_p \\rangle$ is the time-averaged potential energy density and $\\langle E_k \\rangle$ is the time-averaged kinetic energy density. The dimensionless factors $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the monopole and dipole scattering coefficients, which depend on the material properties of the particle (subscript $p$) and the fluid medium (subscript $f$).\n\\[\\boxed{f_1 = 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_p}{\\kappa_f} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_2 = \\frac{2(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)}{2\\rho_p + \\rho_f}}\\]\nHere, $\\kappa$ is the compressibility ($\\kappa = 1/K$, where $K$ is the bulk modulus) and $\\rho$ is the density. For the problem of a solid cylinder in air, we assume the cylinder is rigid and dense.\n1.  **Rigid particle**: The compressibility of the solid particle is negligible compared to that of air, $\\kappa_p \\ll \\kappa_f$, so $\\kappa_p/\\kappa_f \\approx 0$.\n2.  **Dense particle**: The density of the solid particle is much greater than that of air, $\\rho_p \\gg \\rho_f$, so $\\rho_f/\\rho_p \\approx 0$.\n\nApplying these assumptions to the factors $f_1$ and $f_2$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_1 &= 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_p}{\\kappa_f} \\approx 1 - 0 = 1 \\\\\nf_2 &= \\frac{2(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)}{2\\rho_p + \\rho_f} = \\frac{2\\rho_p(1 - \\rho_f/\\rho_p)}{2\\rho_p(1 + \\rho_f/(2\\rho_p))} \\approx \\frac{2(1 - 0)}{2(1 + 0)} = 1\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, for a small, rigid, dense object, the Gor'kov potential simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU = V \\left( \\langle E_p \\rangle - \\langle E_k \\rangle \\right) \\label{eq:U_correct} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Time-Averaged Kinetic and Potential Energy Densities\nWe now calculate the time-averaged energy densities using the first-order quantities from Step 2.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Acoustic Kinetic Energy Density: } E_k = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 v_1^2}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Acoustic Potential Energy Density: } E_p = \\frac{P_1^2}{2 \\rho_0 c^2}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Time Average Identity: } \\langle \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\rangle = \\langle \\cos^2(\\omega t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\sin^2(\\omega t) dt = \\frac{1}{2}}\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the time-averaged kinetic energy density $\\langle E_k \\rangle$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle E_k \\rangle &= \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 v_1^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 \\left\\langle (-A\\omega\\cos(kx)\\sin(\\omega t))^2 \\right\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 A^2 \\omega^2 \\cos^2(kx) \\langle \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 A^2 \\omega^2 \\cos^2(kx) \\label{eq:Ek_avg} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the time-averaged potential energy density $\\langle E_p \\rangle$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle E_p \\rangle &= \\left\\langle \\frac{P_1^2}{2 \\rho_0 c^2} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2 \\rho_0 c^2} \\left\\langle (\\rho_0 c^2 A k \\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t))^2 \\right\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{(\\rho_0 c^2 A k)^2}{2 \\rho_0 c^2} \\sin^2(kx) \\langle \\cos^2(\\omega t) \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\sin^2(kx) \\label{eq:Ep_avg} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Derivation of the Radiation Potential\nNow we substitute the expressions for the averaged energy densities into the simplified formula for the radiation potential $U$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:U_correct}.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Dispersion Relation for Sound: } \\omega = ck}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(x) &= V \\left( \\langle E_p \\rangle - \\langle E_k \\rangle \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= V \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\sin^2(kx) - \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 A^2 \\omega^2 \\cos^2(kx) \\right) &&\\text{(Substituting from eq. \\ref{eq:Ep_avg} and \\ref{eq:Ek_avg})} \\label{eq:U_intermediate} \\tag{13} \\\\\n&= V \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\sin^2(kx) - \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 A^2 (c k)^2 \\cos^2(kx) \\right) &&\\text{(Using the dispersion relation)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\left( \\sin^2(kx) - \\cos^2(kx) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\left( \\cos^2(kx) - \\sin^2(kx) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\cos(2kx) &&\\text{(Using } \\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta \\text{)} \\label{eq:U_simplified} \\tag{14}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculation of the Force\nFinally, we calculate the force $F$ by taking the negative spatial derivative of the potential $U(x)$ and expressing the result in terms of the given parameters.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Sound Speed in an Ideal Gas: } c^2 = \\frac{\\gamma P_0}{\\rho_0}}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF(x) &= -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\cos(2kx) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\cos(2kx) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\left( -2k \\sin(2kx) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^3 \\sin(2kx) \\label{eq:F_intermediate} \\tag{15}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting $V = \\pi R^2 h$ and $\\rho_0 c^2 = \\gamma P_0$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF &= -\\frac{1}{2} (\\pi R^2 h) (\\gamma P_0) A^2 k^3 \\sin(2kx) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2} \\pi R^2 h \\gamma P_0 A^2 k^3 \\sin(2kx) \\label{eq:F_final_calc} \\tag{16}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis result shows that the force on the rigid, dense cylinder depends on its position $x$ in the standing wave.

We determine `A` and `\\phi` from the initial conditions at `t=0`: `x(0) = a+b` and `v(0) = \\dot{x}(0) = 0`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx(0) &= a + A\\cos(\\phi) = a+b \\implies A\\cos(\\phi) = b \\\\\n\\dot{x}(t) &= -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) \\\\\n\\dot{x}(0) &= -A\\omega\\sin(\\phi) = 0 \\implies \\sin(\\phi) = 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nFrom `\\sin(\\phi)=0`, we have `\\phi=0` or `\\phi=\\pi`. Choosing `\\phi=0` gives `A\\cos(0) = A = b`, which is consistent.\nThus, the amplitude of this SHM is `A=b` and the phase is `\\phi=0`. The equation of motion for `x>a` is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx(t) = a + b\\cos(\\omega t) \\label{eq:motion1}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Motion in the Region `x < -a`\nIn this region, the rope is also stretched. The force is again a restoring force directed towards the origin.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe net force on the particle is given by Newton's Second Law.\n\\[\\boxed{F_{\\text{net}} = ma = m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}}\\]\nThe elastic restoring force is given by Hooke's Law.\n\\[\\boxed{F_{\\text{elastic}} = -k \\delta}\\]\nwhere `\\delta` is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n**Derivation**:\nFor `x < -a`, the rope is stretched. By symmetry, this situation is equivalent to a spring whose equilibrium position is at `x=-a`. The displacement from this equilibrium is `\\delta = x - (-a) = x+a`. The net force is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF_{\\text{net}} = F_{\\text{elastic}} = -k(x+a)\n\\end{align}\\]\nApplying Newton's Second Law:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} &= -k(x+a) \\label{eq:eom2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nDefining `\\eta = x+a`, which is the displacement from the center of oscillation `x=-a`, the equation becomes:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm\\frac{d^2\\eta}{dt^2} = -k\\eta \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{d^2\\eta}{dt^2} = -\\omega^2 \\eta\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis is also SHM with the same angular frequency `\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}`, but centered at `x=-a`. By symmetry and conservation of energy, the motion in this region will be a mirror image of the motion in the `x>a` region. The particle will oscillate between `x=-a` and `x=-(a+b)`, so the amplitude of this oscillation is also `b`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Time in the SHM Regions\nThe particle undergoes SHM whenever `|x| > a`. A full cycle of motion involves four segments of SHM.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe period of a simple harmonic oscillator is the time for one full oscillation.\n\\[\\boxed{T_{\\text{SHM}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe full journey of the particle is `a+b \\to a \\to -a \\to -(a+b) \\to -a \\to a \\to a+b`. The SHM parts are:\n1.  **`a+b \\to a`**: Motion from the maximum displacement (`\\xi=b`) to the center of oscillation (`\\xi=0`) for the SHM about `x=a`. This takes one-quarter of a full SHM period: `t_{1} = \\frac{1}{4} T_{\\text{SHM}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}`.\n2.  **`-a \\to -(a+b)`**: Motion from the center of oscillation (`\\eta=0`) to the maximum negative displacement (`\\eta=-b`) for the SHM about `x=-a`. This also takes one-quarter of a period: `t_{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}`.\n3.  **`-(a+b) \\to -a`**: The return journey is symmetric and takes another quarter period: `t_{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}`.\n4.  **`a \\to a+b`**: The final segment of the return journey also takes a quarter period: `t_{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}`.\n\nThe total time spent in the SHM regions is the sum of these four segments:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nt_{\\text{SHM}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 = 4 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\label{eq:t_shm}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Time in the Constant Velocity Region\nIn the region `-a \\le x \\le a`, the rope is slack, so the net force is zero. The particle moves with constant velocity.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nAccording to Newton's First Law, if the net force is zero, the velocity is constant.\n\\[\\boxed{F_{\\text{net}} = 0 \\implies \\vec{v} = \\text{constant}}\\]\nFor motion with constant speed, time is distance divided by speed.\n\\[\\boxed{\\Delta t = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nFirst, we need to find the speed of the particle in this region. The particle first enters this region at `x=a`. This occurs at the end of the first SHM segment. From Step 1, the velocity function is `\\dot{x}(t) = -b\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)`. The particle reaches `x=a` when `b\\cos(\\omega t) = 0`, which first happens at `t = \\pi/(2\\omega)`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_a = \\dot{x}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}\\right) = -b\\omega\\sin\\left(\\omega \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}\\right) = -b\\omega\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = -b\\omega\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe speed of the particle as it moves through the region `-a \\le x \\le a` is constant: `|v| = |-b\\omega| = b\\omega`.\nThe particle makes two passages through this region in a full cycle:\n1.  **`a \\to -a`**: The distance is `2a`. The time taken is `t_{5} = \\frac{2a}{b\\omega}`.\n2.  **`-a \\to a`**: The distance is `2a`. The time taken is `t_{6} = \\frac{2a}{b\\omega}`.\n\nThe total time spent in the constant velocity region is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nt_{\\text{const\\_v}} = t_5 + t_6 = \\frac{2a}{b\\omega} + \\frac{2a}{b\\omega} = \\frac{4a}{b\\omega} = \\frac{4a}{b}\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\label{eq:t_const_v}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Time for a Full Cycle\nThe total time `T` for the particle to return to its release position is the sum of the time spent in the SHM regions and the time spent in the constant velocity region.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe total time for a sequence of motions is the sum of the durations of the individual motions.\n\\[\\boxed{T_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i \\Delta t_i}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nT &= t_{\\text{SHM}} + t_{\\text{const\\_v}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} + \\frac{4a}{b}\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\quad (\\text{using eq. \\ref{eq:t_shm} and \\ref{eq:t_const_v}}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left(2\\pi + \\frac{4a}{b}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2\\left(\\pi + \\frac{2a}{b}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\label{eq:total_time}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe time it takes for the particle to return to the original release position is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{T = 2\\left(\\pi + \\frac{2a}{b}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}}\n\\end{align}\\]"}

We are asked to find the total angle of rotation the ball undergoes around the planet's center until it stops bouncing and begins to roll on the surface.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   $R$: The radius of the planet.\n*   $v_0$: The first cosmic velocity at the planet's surface. This is the speed required for a circular orbit at radius $R$. It is related to the planet's mass $M$ and the gravitational constant $G$ by $v_0 = \\sqrt{GM/R}$.\n*   $k$: A dimensionless factor ($k<1$) such that the initial launch speed is $v = k v_0$.\n*   $\\theta$: The initial launch angle with respect to the local horizontal (tangent to the surface). It is stated to be a small angle.\n*   $\\varepsilon$: The coefficient of restitution for bounces on the planet's surface.\n\nThe physical process involves the ball being launched into a sub-orbital trajectory. Since $k<1$, its initial speed is less than that required for a circular orbit, so it follows an elliptical path that intersects the planet's surface. At each intersection, it bounces. The surface is smooth, implying no friction. The bounces are inelastic ($0 \\le \\varepsilon < 1$), governed by the coefficient of restitution $\\varepsilon$. This process of flying and bouncing repeats, with the ball losing kinetic energy associated with its radial motion at each bounce, until it eventually stops bouncing. We need to calculate the total angle $\\varphi$ subtended at the planet's center by all the flight segments combined.\n\nWe will use a polar coordinate system $(r, \\phi)$ with its origin at the center of the planet. The motion occurs in a single plane due to the central nature of the gravitational force. The velocity of the ball can be decomposed into a radial component $v_r$ and a tangential component $v_t$.\n\nKey assumptions:\n*   The planet is a perfect, non-rotating sphere.\n*   The ball is treated as a point mass, with mass $m$.\n*   The only force acting on the ball during its flight is the planet's gravity, $\\vec{F}_g = -\\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\hat{r}$.\n*   There is no atmospheric drag.\n\n### Step 1: Velocity Components and Angular Momentum Conservation\nWe first analyze the velocity components and the effect of bounces on them. The motion consists of a series of orbital segments, indexed by $m=0, 1, 2, \\dots$, where $m$ is the number of bounces that have occurred.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nThe change in momentum $\\Delta\\vec{p}$ due to an impulsive force $\\vec{F}_{\\text{impulse}}$ is given by the impulse $\\vec{J}$. For a smooth surface, the impulse is purely normal (radial).\n\\[\\boxed{\\Delta\\vec{p} = \\vec{J} = \\int \\vec{F}_{\\text{impulse}} dt}\\]\nThe coefficient of restitution $\\varepsilon$ relates the normal components of velocity before and after a collision.\n\\[\\boxed{\\varepsilon = -\\frac{v_{\\text{normal, after}}}{v_{\\text{normal, before}}}}\\]\nThe rate of change of angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ is equal to the net external torque $\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{net}}$.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{net}}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nLet $v_{r,m}$ and $v_{t,m}$ be the radial and tangential velocity components immediately after the $m$-th bounce. For $m=0$, these are the initial launch velocities.\nThe initial velocity components are:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_{r,0} &= (k v_0) \\sin\\theta \\\\\nv_{t,0} &= (k v_0) \\cos\\theta\n\\end{align}\\]\nDuring a bounce, the impulsive force from the smooth surface is purely radial. Thus, there is no tangential impulse, and the tangential velocity component is conserved across every bounce.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_{t,m} = v_{t,m-1} = \\dots = v_{t,0} = k v_0 \\cos\\theta \\label{eq:v_t_m} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe radial velocity changes at each bounce. For the $m$-th flight segment, the radial velocity at landing is $-v_{r,m}$ due to the symmetry of the elliptical path. This landing velocity is the \"before\" velocity for the $(m+1)$-th bounce. The \"after\" velocity is the launch velocity for the $(m+1)$-th segment, $v_{r,m+1}$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_{r,m+1} = -\\varepsilon (v_{r, \\text{before}}) = -\\varepsilon (-v_{r,m}) = \\varepsilon v_{r,m}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis forms a geometric progression. The radial velocity for the launch of the $m$-th segment is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_{r,m} = \\varepsilon^m v_{r,0} = \\varepsilon^m k v_0 \\sin\\theta \\label{eq:v_r_m} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe angular momentum is $\\vec{L} = \\vec{r} \\times (m\\vec{v})$, with magnitude $L = m r v_t$. During flight, gravity is a central force ($\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{net}} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}_g = 0$), so $L$ is conserved. During a bounce, the impulsive force is also radial, so it exerts no torque. Therefore, the angular momentum is conserved throughout the entire process.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nL = m R v_{t,m} = m R (k v_0 \\cos\\theta) \\quad (\\text{constant for all } m) \\label{eq:L} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Orbital Parameters for Each Flight Segment\nThe path between bounces is a segment of an ellipse. We determine the parameters of the ellipse for the flight after the $m$-th bounce.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nThe semi-latus rectum $p$ of a Keplerian orbit is related to angular momentum $L$.\n\\[\\boxed{p = \\frac{L^2}{G M m^2}}\\]\nThe total mechanical energy $E$ of the ball in orbit is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{G M m}{r}}\\]\nThe energy is related to the semi-major axis $a$ of the elliptical orbit.\n\\[\\boxed{E = -\\frac{G M m}{2a}}\\]\nThe semi-latus rectum $p$, semi-major axis $a$, and eccentricity $e$ are related by:\n\\[\\boxed{p = a(1-e^2)}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nThe semi-latus rectum $p$ is the same for all flight segments because $L$ is constant. Using $GM = R v_0^2$ and Eq. \\ref{eq:L}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\np &= \\frac{(m R k v_0 \\cos\\theta)^2}{G M m^2} = \\frac{m^2 R^2 k^2 v_0^2 \\cos^2\\theta}{(R v_0^2) m^2} = R k^2 \\cos^2\\theta \\label{eq:p} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe total energy $E_m$ for the $m$-th segment depends on the launch speed for that segment, $v_m^2 = v_{r,m}^2 + v_{t,m}^2$. At the start of each segment ($r=R$):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nE_m &= \\frac{1}{2}m(v_{r,m}^2 + v_{t,m}^2) - \\frac{G M m}{R} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}m \\left( (\\varepsilon^m k v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2 + (k v_0 \\cos\\theta)^2 \\right) - m v_0^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}m v_0^2 \\left[ k^2(\\varepsilon^{2m}\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) - 2 \\right] \\label{eq:E_m} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe semi-major axis $a_m$ for the $m$-th segment is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\na_m &= -\\frac{G M m}{2E_m} = -\\frac{R v_0^2 m}{2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}m v_0^2 \\left( k^2(\\varepsilon^{2m}\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) - 2 \\right) \\right]} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{R}{2 - k^2(\\varepsilon^{2m}\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta)} \\label{eq:a_m} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe eccentricity $e_m$ for the $m$-th segment is found from $p = a_m(1-e_m^2)$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ne_m^2 &= 1 - \\frac{p}{a_m} = 1 - \\frac{R k^2 \\cos^2\\theta}{\\frac{R}{2 - k^2(\\varepsilon^{2m}\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta)}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 1 - k^2 \\cos^2\\theta \\left[ 2 - k^2(\\varepsilon^{2m}\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 1 - 2k^2 \\cos^2\\theta + k^4 \\cos^2\\theta (\\varepsilon^{2m}\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (1 - 2k^2 \\cos^2\\theta + k^4 \\cos^4\\theta) + \\varepsilon^{2m}k^4\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (1 - k^2\\cos^2\\theta)^2 + \\varepsilon^{2m}k^4\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta \\label{eq:e_m_sq} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Angular Span of a Single Flight Segment\nWe now find the angle subtended by a single bounce-to-bounce trajectory.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nThe polar equation for a conic section (orbit) with the origin at one focus is:\n\\[\\boxed{r(\\nu) = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos\\nu}}\\]\nwhere $\\nu$ is the true anomaly, the angle measured from the pericenter (point of closest approach).\n\n**Derivation**\nSince the radial velocity at launch $v_{r,m}$ is positive, the ball moves outwards towards the apocenter (point of farthest approach). The flight path from launch to landing is symmetric about the apse line containing the apocenter. It is convenient to measure the angle from the apocenter. Let this angle be $\\phi_a$, where $\\nu = \\phi_a + \\pi$, so $\\cos\\nu = -\\cos\\phi_a$.

The physical system is defined as follows:\n\n*   **Geometry**: A planar interface at $y=0$ separates two media.\n    *   **Medium 1 (Dielectric)**: Located in the region $y<0$. It is a non-lossy medium characterized by a real, positive relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_1 > 1$.\n    *   **Medium 2 (Metal)**: Located in the region $y>0$. It is a lossy medium characterized by a complex relative permittivity $\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{2}=\\varepsilon_{21}+\\mathrm{i}\\varepsilon_{22}$. The real part $\\varepsilon_{21}$ is negative, and the imaginary part $\\varepsilon_{22}$ is a small, positive quantity representing absorption losses.\n*   **Electromagnetic Wave**: We consider a Transverse Magnetic (TM) polarized wave. For this polarization, the magnetic field vector $\\mathbf{H}$ is perpendicular to the plane of incidence (the $xy$-plane), so $\\mathbf{H} = H_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The electric field vector $\\mathbf{E}$ lies within the $xy$-plane. This wave propagates along the $x$-direction and is confined to the interface, meaning its amplitude decays exponentially into both media away from $y=0$.\n*   **Variables**:\n    *   $\\varepsilon_1$: Relative permittivity of the dielectric.\n    *   $\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 = \\varepsilon_{21} + i\\varepsilon_{22}$: Complex relative permittivity of the metal.\n    *   $\\lambda_0$: Wavelength of the electromagnetic wave in a vacuum.\n    *   $k_0 = 2\\pi/\\lambda_0$: Wave number of the electromagnetic wave in a vacuum.\n    *   $k_x$: The propagation constant (wavevector component) of the SPP along the $x$-direction. Due to the lossy metal, $k_x$ is expected to be a complex number, where its real part determines the wavelength and its imaginary part determines the propagation loss.\n    *   $\\lambda$: The wavelength of the SPP mode, which is related to the real part of $k_x$.\n*   **Objective**: Find an expression for the SPP wavelength $\\lambda$ in terms of $\\varepsilon_1$, the components of $\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2$, and $\\lambda_0$. The result should be an approximation to the lowest order, treating the imaginary part of the metal's permittivity, $\\varepsilon_{22}$, as a small parameter.\n*   **Assumptions**: The media are non-magnetic, so their relative permeability is $\\mu_r=1$. The fields are time-harmonic with an angular frequency $\\omega$, and their time dependence is described by the factor $e^{-i\\omega t}$.\n\n### Step 1: Wave Equations and Field Expressions\nWe begin with Maxwell's equations for a source-free, non-magnetic, isotropic medium. For time-harmonic fields (where the time derivative $\\partial/\\partial t$ is replaced by $-i\\omega$), the two curl equations are:\n\\[\\boxed{\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = i\\omega\\mu_0\\mathbf{H}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = -i\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\tilde{\\varepsilon}\\mathbf{E}}\\]\nFor a TM wave with $\\mathbf{H} = (0, 0, H_z)$, these equations can be combined to yield the Helmholtz equation for the magnetic field component $H_z$. The solution must represent a wave propagating in the $x$-direction and decaying in the $\\pm y$-direction away from the interface.\n\nThe spatial part of the magnetic field in each medium is written as:\n*   In medium 1 (dielectric, $y<0$):\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    H_{1z}(x,y) = A_1 e^{i(k_x x + k_{1y} y)}\n    \\label{eq:H1} \\tag{1}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n*   In medium 2 (metal, $y>0$):\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    H_{2z}(x,y) = A_2 e^{i(k_x x + k_{2y} y)}\n    \\label{eq:H2} \\tag{2}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\nFor the wave to be a surface wave confined to the interface at $y=0$, the fields must vanish as $|y| \\to \\infty$. This imposes conditions on the imaginary parts of the perpendicular wavevector components, $k_{1y}$ and $k_{2y}$.\nLet $k_y = \\text{Re}(k_y) + i\\text{Im}(k_y)$. The y-dependence of the field is $e^{i\\text{Re}(k_y)y}e^{-\\text{Im}(k_y)y}$.\n*   For decay in medium 1 (as $y \\to -\\infty$), the exponent $-\\text{Im}(k_{1y})y$ must tend to $-\\infty$. This requires $-\\text{Im}(k_{1y}) > 0$, which implies $\\text{Im}(k_{1y}) < 0$.\n*   For decay in medium 2 (as $y \\to +\\infty$), the exponent $-\\text{Im}(k_{2y})y$ must tend to $-\\infty$. This requires $-\\text{Im}(k_{2y}) < 0$, which implies $\\text{Im}(k_{2y}) > 0$.\n\n### Step 2: Dispersion Relations in Each Medium\nSubstituting the field expressions into the general Helmholtz equation for a TM wave yields the dispersion relation for each medium.\n\\[\\boxed{\\nabla^2 H_z + \\tilde{\\varepsilon} k_0^2 H_z = 0}\\]\nApplying this to our field expressions, where $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$, gives:\n*   In medium 1 (dielectric, $\\tilde{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon_1$):\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\left(-(k_x)^2 - (k_{1y})^2\\right) H_{1z} + \\varepsilon_1 k_0^2 H_{1z} = 0 \\implies k_x^2 + k_{1y}^2 = \\varepsilon_1 k_0^2\n    \\label{eq:disp1} \\tag{3}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n*   In medium 2 (metal, $\\tilde{\\varepsilon} = \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2$):\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\left(-(k_x)^2 - (k_{2y})^2\\right) H_{2z} + \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 k_0^2 H_{2z} = 0 \\implies k_x^2 + k_{2y}^2 = \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 k_0^2\n    \\label{eq:disp2} \\tag{4}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n### Step 3: Applying Boundary Conditions to Derive the SPP Dispersion Relation\nAt the interface $y=0$, the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields must be continuous. The normal vector to the interface is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n\\[\\boxed{\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\times (\\mathbf{H}_2 - \\mathbf{H}_1) = 0}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\times (\\mathbf{E}_2 - \\mathbf{E}_1) = 0}\\]\nThe tangential magnetic field is $H_z$. Its continuity at $y=0$ gives $H_{1z}(x,0) = H_{2z}(x,0)$, which from Eqs. (\\ref{eq:H1}) and (\\ref{eq:H2}) implies $A_1 = A_2$.\nThe tangential electric field is $E_x$. We find its expression from Maxwell's equation $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = -i\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\tilde{\\varepsilon}\\mathbf{E}$. For $\\mathbf{H} = H_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the curl is $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial y}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial x}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The $x$-component of the equation is $\\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial y} = -i\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\tilde{\\varepsilon}E_x$.\nThus, $E_x = \\frac{i}{\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\tilde{\\varepsilon}}\\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial y}$. Applying this to our fields:\n$E_{1x} = \\frac{i(ik_{1y})}{\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_1}H_{1z} = \\frac{-k_{1y}}{\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_1}H_{1z}$ and $E_{2x} = \\frac{i(ik_{2y})}{\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2}H_{2z} = \\frac{-k_{2y}}{\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2}H_{2z}$.\nContinuity of $E_x$ at $y=0$ requires $E_{1x}(x,0) = E_{2x}(x,0)$, which leads to:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{-k_{1y}}{\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_1}A_1 e^{ik_x x} &= \\frac{-k_{2y}}{\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2}A_2 e^{ik_x x} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{k_{1y}}{\\varepsilon_1} &= \\frac{k_{2y}}{\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2} \\quad (\\text{since } A_1=A_2)\n\\label{eq:bc_relation} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe now solve the system of equations (\\ref{eq:disp1}), (\\ref{eq:disp2}), and (\\ref{eq:bc_relation}) for $k_x$. From (\\ref{eq:disp1}) and (\\ref{eq:disp2}), we express $k_{1y}^2 = \\varepsilon_1 k_0^2 - k_x^2$ and $k_{2y}^2 = \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 k_0^2 - k_x^2$. Squaring Eq. (\\ref{eq:bc_relation}) gives $k_{1y}^2/\\varepsilon_1^2 = k_{2y}^2/\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2^2$. Substituting the expressions for $k_{1y}^2$ and $k_{2y}^2$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\varepsilon_1 k_0^2 - k_x^2}{\\varepsilon_1^2} &= \\frac{\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 k_0^2 - k_x^2}{\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2^2 (\\varepsilon_1 k_0^2 - k_x^2) &= \\varepsilon_1^2 (\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 k_0^2 - k_x^2) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\varepsilon_1 \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2^2 k_0^2 - \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2^2 k_x^2 &= \\varepsilon_1^2 \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 k_0^2 - \\varepsilon_1^2 k_x^2 \\nonumber \\\\\nk_x^2 (\\varepsilon_1^2 - \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2^2) &= k_0^2 (\\varepsilon_1^2 \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 - \\varepsilon_1 \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2^2) \\nonumber \\\\\nk_x^2 (\\varepsilon_1 - \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2)(\\varepsilon_1 + \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2) &= k_0^2 \\varepsilon_1 \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 (\\varepsilon_1 - \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2) \\nonumber \\\\\nk_x^2 &= k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2}\n\\label{eq:spp_disp} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is the general dispersion relation for SPPs at a dielectric-metal interface.\n\n### Step 4: Approximation for a Lossy Metal\nWe now substitute the complex permittivity $\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_2 = \\varepsilon_{21} + i\\varepsilon_{22}$ into the dispersion relation (\\ref{eq:spp_disp}) and approximate the expression for $k_x^2$ to the first order in the small parameter $\\varepsilon_{22}$. We use the first-order Taylor expansion for this.\n\\[\\boxed{(1+x)^{-1} \\approx 1-x \\text{ for } |x| \\ll 1}\\]\nWe apply this principle to the denominator of our dispersion relation.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk_x^2 &= k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 (\\varepsilon_{21} + i\\varepsilon_{22})}{(\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}) + i\\varepsilon_{22}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 (\\varepsilon_{21} + i\\varepsilon_{22})}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\left(1 + i\\frac{\\varepsilon_{22}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}}\\right)^{-1} \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 (\\varepsilon_{21} + i\\varepsilon_{22})}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\left(1 - i\\frac{\\varepsilon_{22}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}}\\right) \\quad (\\text{using Taylor approximation}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\left( \\varepsilon_{21} - i\\frac{\\varepsilon_{21}\\varepsilon_{22}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} + i\\varepsilon_{22} - i^2\\frac{\\varepsilon_{22}^2}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\left( \\varepsilon_{21} + i\\left(\\varepsilon_{22} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{21}\\varepsilon_{22}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}}\\right) \\right) \\quad (\\text{neglecting the } \\varepsilon_{22}^2 \\text{ term}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\left( \\varepsilon_{21} + i\\frac{\\varepsilon_{22}(\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}) - \\varepsilon_{21}\\varepsilon_{22}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} + i k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1^2 \\varepsilon_{22}}{(\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21})^2}\n\\label{eq:k_squared_approx} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Relating the Wavevector to Wavelength\nThe propagation constant $k_x$ is complex, which we write as $k_x = k_{x,r} + i k_{x,i}$. The real part $k_{x,r}$ is related to the SPP wavelength $\\lambda$, and the imaginary part $k_{x,i}$ describes the attenuation along the $x$-direction.\n\\[\\boxed{k_{x,r} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}}\\]\nWe expand $k_x^2$ and equate the real and imaginary parts with our result from Step 4.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk_x^2 = (k_{x,r} + i k_{x,i})^2 = k_{x,r}^2 - k_{x,i}^2 + 2i k_{x,r} k_{x,i}\n\\label{eq:kx_expanded} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBy comparing the complex expression (\\ref{eq:k_squared_approx}) with (\\ref{eq:kx_expanded}), we identify the real and imaginary parts:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Re}(k_x^2) &= k_{x,r}^2 - k_{x,i}^2 = k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\label{eq:real_part} \\tag{9} \\\\\n\\text{Im}(k_x^2) &= 2 k_{x,r} k_{x,i} = k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1^2 \\varepsilon_{22}}{(\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21})^2} \\label{eq:imag_part} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe problem asks for an approximation to the lowest order in the small quantity $\\varepsilon_{22}$. From Eq. (\\ref{eq:imag_part}), we see that the product $k_{x,r} k_{x,i}$ is proportional to $\\varepsilon_{22}$. To the zeroth order (the lossless case where $\\varepsilon_{22}=0$), $k_{x,r}$ is finite and non-zero, while $k_{x,i}=0$. For a small $\\varepsilon_{22}$, $k_{x,r}$ will have a small correction, but $k_{x,i}$ itself will be a small quantity of the first order in $\\varepsilon_{22}$. Consequently, the term $k_{x,i}^2$ in Eq. (\\ref{eq:real_part}) is of the second order in $\\varepsilon_{22}$ (i.e., $\\propto \\varepsilon_{22}^2$). To obtain a lowest-order approximation for the wavelength, we can neglect this second-order term.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk_{x,r}^2 &\\approx k_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 &\\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_0}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} &\\approx \\frac{1}{\\lambda_0^2} \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lambda^2 &\\approx \\lambda_0^2 \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_{21}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lambda &\\approx \\lambda_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_{21}}}\n\\label{eq:final_lambda_derivation} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe wavelength $\\lambda$ of the surface plasmon polariton mode, approximated to the lowest order in the metal's loss term, is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\lambda = \\lambda_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_{21}}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

Inside this cylinder, a distribution of positive charges is present. Each charge has a value $q$, and the number density of these charges in the laboratory reference frame ($S$) is $n$. In frame $S$, these charges are in relativistic motion, revolving around the cylinder's axis (which we define as the z-axis) with a uniform angular velocity $\\omega$.\n\nWe are asked to calculate the total electromagnetic power radiated per unit length by this charge distribution, as observed in a different inertial reference frame, $S'$. The frame $S'$ moves with a constant velocity $\\pmb{V} = \\beta c \\hat{\\pmb{z}}$ relative to frame $S$, parallel to the cylinder's axis.\n\nThe calculation must be performed by first determining the motion and radiation of a single charge in frame $S'$, and then summing these contributions over the entire charge distribution as observed in $S'$. We are given the relativistic Larmor formula for the instantaneous power radiated by a single charge $q$ with velocity $\\pmb{v}$ and acceleration $\\pmb{a}$. We must assume that the radiation from different charges is incoherent, meaning the total power is the sum of the powers from individual charges. We are explicitly instructed not to use Lorentz transformation formulas for energy or power directly.\n\nThe key variables and constants are:\n-   $R$: The radius of the cylindrical charge distribution.\n-   $n$: The number of charges per unit volume, as measured in frame $S$.\n-   $q$: The electric charge of each particle.\n-   $\\omega$: The uniform angular velocity of the charges in frame $S$.\n-   $S$: The laboratory reference frame where the cylinder axis is at rest.\n-   $S'$: The reference frame moving with velocity $\\pmb{V}$ relative to $S$.\n-   $\\pmb{V} = \\beta c \\hat{\\pmb{z}}$: The velocity of frame $S'$ relative to frame $S$.\n-   $c$: The speed of light in vacuum.\n-   $\\varepsilon_0$: The permittivity of free space.\n-   $P'$: The total radiated power per unit length, as measured in frame $S'$.\n\n### Step 1: Kinematics and Radiation of a Single Charge in Frame S\nFirst, we describe the motion of a single charge in the laboratory frame $S$. A charge at a radial distance $r$ from the axis ($0 \\le r \\le R$) undergoes uniform circular motion in the $xy$-plane.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe position vector for a particle in uniform circular motion in the xy-plane is:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\pmb{r}(t) = (r \\cos(\\omega t), r \\sin(\\omega t), 0)\n}\\]\nVelocity and acceleration are the first and second time derivatives of position:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\pmb{v} = \\frac{d\\pmb{r}}{dt}, \\quad \\pmb{a} = \\frac{d\\pmb{v}}{dt}\n}\\]\nThe instantaneous radiated power of a charge $q$ is given by the relativistic Larmor formula:\n\\[\\boxed{\nP = \\frac{\\gamma^6 q^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\left[ a^2 - \\frac{(\\pmb{v} \\times \\pmb{a})^2}{c^2} \\right]\n}\\]\nwhere $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor of the charge.\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe velocity $\\pmb{v}$ and acceleration $\\pmb{a}$ of the charge in frame $S$ are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\pmb{v}(t) &= \\frac{d\\pmb{r}}{dt} = (-r\\omega \\sin(\\omega t), r\\omega \\cos(\\omega t), 0) \\label{eq:v_S} \\\\\n\\pmb{a}(t) &= \\frac{d\\pmb{v}}{dt} = (-r\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t), -r\\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t), 0) \\label{eq:a_S}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe magnitudes are constant: $v = r\\omega$ and $a = r\\omega^2$. The velocity and acceleration vectors are always perpendicular, as shown by their dot product: $\\pmb{v} \\cdot \\pmb{a} = 0$. The Lorentz factor for this charge in frame $S$ is $\\gamma_v = (1 - (r\\omega)^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$.\n\nSince $\\pmb{v} \\perp \\pmb{a}$, the magnitude of their cross product is $|\\pmb{v} \\times \\pmb{a}| = va$. The Larmor formula for the power $P_1$ radiated by this single charge simplifies:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_1 &= \\frac{\\gamma_v^6 q^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\left[ a^2 - \\frac{v^2 a^2}{c^2} \\right] = \\frac{\\gamma_v^6 q^2 a^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\left( 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\gamma_v^6 q^2 a^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\frac{1}{\\gamma_v^2} = \\frac{\\gamma_v^4 q^2 a^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\label{eq:P1_S}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting $a = r\\omega^2$ and $\\gamma_v = (1 - (r\\omega)^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$, we get the power as a function of radial position $r$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_1(r) = \\frac{q^2 (r\\omega^2)^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3 (1 - (r\\omega)^2/c^2)^2} = \\frac{q^2 \\omega^4 r^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3 (1 - (r\\omega)^2/c^2)^2} \\label{eq:P1_r}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Radiated Power per Unit Length in Frame S\nTo find the total power per unit length in frame $S$, denoted $P_S$, we integrate the power from a single charge $P_1(r)$ over the entire charge distribution within a unit length of the cylinder.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe radiation is incoherent, so the total power is the sum of individual powers:\n\\[\\boxed{\ndP_{\\text{total}} = P_1 dN\n}\\]\nThe number of particles $dN$ in a volume element $dV$ is given by the number density $n$:\n\\[\\boxed{\ndN = n dV\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe number of particles $dN$ in a cylindrical shell of radius $r$, thickness $dr$, and length $dL$ is $dN = n (2\\pi r dr dL)$. The number of particles per unit length in this shell is $dN/dL = 2\\pi n r dr$. The total power per unit length, $P_S$, is obtained by integrating the contributions from all radii from $0$ to $R$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_S &= \\int_0^R P_1(r) \\frac{dN}{dL} = \\int_0^R P_1(r) (2\\pi n r) dr \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\int_0^R \\frac{q^2 \\omega^4 r^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3 (1 - (r\\omega)^2/c^2)^2} (2\\pi n r) dr \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{n q^2 \\omega^4}{3\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\int_0^R \\frac{r^3}{(1 - (r\\omega)^2/c^2)^2} dr \\label{eq:PS_integral}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution $u = (r\\omega/c)^2$. This gives $r^2 = u c^2/\\omega^2$ and $2r dr = (c^2/\\omega^2) du$, so $r^3 dr = r^2(r dr) = \\frac{c^4}{2\\omega^4} u du$. The integration limits become $u=0$ to $u_R = (\\omega R/c)^2$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^R \\frac{r^3 dr}{(1 - (r\\omega)^2/c^2)^2} &= \\int_0^{u_R} \\frac{\\frac{c^4}{2\\omega^4} u du}{(1-u)^2} = \\frac{c^4}{2\\omega^4} \\int_0^{u_R} \\frac{u}{(1-u)^2} du \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{where } \\int \\frac{u}{(1-u)^2} du &= \\int \\frac{1-(1-u)}{(1-u)^2} du = \\int \\left( \\frac{1}{(1-u)^2} - \\frac{1}{1-u} \\right) du = \\frac{1}{1-u} + \\ln(1-u) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{So, } \\frac{c^4}{2\\omega^4} \\left[ \\frac{1}{1-u} + \\ln(1-u) \\right]_0^{u_R} &= \\frac{c^4}{2\\omega^4} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{1-u_R} + \\ln(1-u_R)\\right) - (1+0) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{c^4}{2\\omega^4} \\left[ \\frac{u_R}{1-u_R} + \\ln(1-u_R) \\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting this back into Eq. \\eqref{eq:PS_integral}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_S &= \\frac{n q^2 \\omega^4}{3\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\frac{c^4}{2\\omega^4} \\left[ \\frac{(\\omega R/c)^2}{1-(\\omega R/c)^2} + \\ln\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{\\omega R}{c}\\right)^2\\right) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{n q^2 c}{6\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{(\\omega R/c)^2}{1-(\\omega R/c)^2} + \\ln\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 R^2}{c^2}\\right) \\right] \\label{eq:PS_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Lorentz Transformation of Kinematic Quantities\nNow, we transform the velocity and acceleration of a charge from frame $S$ to frame $S'$. The boost is along the z-axis with velocity $\\pmb{V} = (0, 0, \\beta c)$. The Lorentz factor for the boost is $\\gamma_\\beta = (1-\\beta^2)^{-1/2}$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe Lorentz transformation for a velocity $\\pmb{u}$ is given by its components parallel ($\\pmb{u}_{||}$) and perpendicular ($\\pmb{u}_{\\perp}$) to the boost velocity $\\pmb{V}$:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\pmb{u}'_{||} = \\frac{\\pmb{u}_{||} - \\pmb{V}}{1 - \\pmb{u} \\cdot \\pmb{V} / c^2}\n}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\pmb{u}'_{\\perp} = \\frac{\\pmb{u}_{\\perp}}{\\gamma_\\beta(1 - \\pmb{u} \\cdot \\pmb{V} / c^2)}\n}\\]\nThe Lorentz transformation for acceleration $\\pmb{a}$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\pmb{a}' = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_\\beta^2(1-\\pmb{u}\\cdot\\pmb{V}/c^2)^2} \\left[ \\pmb{a} - \\frac{\\pmb{V}\\times(\\pmb{u}\\times\\pmb{a})}{c^2} \\right] - \\frac{\\pmb{u}\\cdot\\pmb{a}}{\\gamma_\\beta^2(1-\\pmb{u}\\cdot\\pmb{V}/c^2)^3} \\frac{\\pmb{V}}{c^2}\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nFor a charge in our problem, the velocity in frame $S$ is $\\pmb{v} = (v_x, v_y, 0)$, which is entirely perpendicular to the boost $\\pmb{V}$. Thus, $\\pmb{v}_{||} = 0$, $\\pmb{v}_{\\perp} = \\pmb{v}$, and $\\pmb{v} \\cdot \\pmb{V} = 0$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\pmb{v}'_{||} &= \\frac{0 - \\pmb{V}}{1 - 0} = -\\pmb{V} = (0, 0, -\\beta c) \\\\\n\\pmb{v}'_{\\perp} &= \\frac{\\pmb{v}_{\\perp}}{\\gamma_\\beta(1 - 0)} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_\\beta}(v_x, v_y, 0) \\\\\n\\pmb{v}' &= \\pmb{v}'_{||} + \\pmb{v}'_{\\perp} = (v_x/\\gamma_\\beta, v_y/\\gamma_\\beta, -\\beta c) \\label{eq:v_prime}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFor the acceleration transformation, we note that $\\pmb{u}\\cdot\\pmb{V} = \\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{V} = 0$ and $\\pmb{u}\\cdot\\pmb{a} = \\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{a} = 0$. Also, the vector triple product $\\pmb{V}\\times(\\pmb{v}\\times\\pmb{a}) = \\pmb{v}(\\pmb{V}\\cdot\\pmb{a}) - \\pmb{a}(\\pmb{V}\\cdot\\pmb{v})$ is zero because $\\pmb{V}$ is orthogonal to both $\\pmb{v}$ and $\\pmb{a}$. The formula simplifies significantly:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\pmb{a}' &= \\frac{1}{\\gamma_\\beta^2(1-0)^2} \\left[ \\pmb{a} - 0 \\right] - 0 = \\frac{\\pmb{a}}{\\gamma_\\beta^2} \\label{eq:a_prime}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe magnitude squared of the acceleration in $S'$ is $a'^2 = a^2/\\gamma_\\beta^4$. We check if velocity and acceleration are perpendicular in $S'$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\pmb{v}' \\cdot \\pmb{a}' &= \\left(\\frac{\\pmb{v}}{\\gamma_\\beta} - \\pmb{V}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\pmb{a}}{\\gamma_\\beta^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{a}}{\\gamma_\\beta^3} - \\frac{\\pmb{V}\\cdot\\pmb{a}}{\\gamma_\\beta^2} = \\frac{0}{\\gamma_\\beta^3} - \\frac{0}{\\gamma_\\beta^2} = 0 \\label{eq:vprime_dot_aprime}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSo, the velocity and acceleration vectors are also perpendicular in frame $S'$.\n\n### Step 4: Radiated Power of a Single Charge in Frame S'\nWe now calculate the radiated power of a single charge in frame $S'$, $P'_1$, using the Larmor formula with the transformed quantities $\\pmb{v}'$ and $\\pmb{a}'$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe relativistic Larmor formula is valid in any inertial frame:\n\\[\\boxed{\nP'_1 = \\frac{\\gamma_{v'}^6 q^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\left[ a'^2 - \\frac{(\\pmb{v}' \\times \\pmb{a}')^2}{c^2} \\right]\n}\\]\nThe Lorentz factor for the particle in frame $S'$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\gamma_{v'} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v'^2/c^2}}\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nSince we found that $\\pmb{v}' \\cdot \\pmb{a}' = 0$ (Eq. \\ref{eq:vprime_dot_aprime}), the formula for $P'_1$ simplifies in the same way as in Step 1:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP'_1 = \\frac{\\gamma_{v'}^4 q^2 a'^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\label{eq:P1_Sprime}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe need the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_{v'}$ for the charge in frame $S'$. From Eq. \\eqref{eq:v_prime}, the squared speed is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv'^2 &= v_x'^2 + v_y'^2 + v_z'^2 = \\frac{v_x^2}{\\gamma_\\beta^2} + \\frac{v_y^2}{\\gamma_\\beta^2} + (-\\beta c)^2 = \\frac{v^2}{\\gamma_\\beta^2} + \\beta^2 c^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n1 - \\frac{v'^2}{c^2} &= 1 - \\left(\\frac{v^2}{c^2\\gamma_\\beta^2} + \\beta^2\\right) = (1-\\beta^2) - \\frac{v^2}{c^2\\gamma_\\beta^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_\\beta^2} - \\frac{v^2}{c^2\\gamma_\\beta^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_\\beta^2}\\left(1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_\\beta^2 \\gamma_v^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\implies \\gamma_{v'} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v'^2/c^2}} = \\gamma_\\beta \\gamma_v \\label{eq:gamma_v_prime}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, substitute $\\gamma_{v'}$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:gamma_v_prime} and $a'^2 = a^2/\\gamma_\\beta^4$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:a_prime} into Eq. \\eqref{eq:P1_Sprime}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP'_1 &= \\frac{(\\gamma_\\beta \\gamma_v)^4 q^2 (a^2/\\gamma_\\beta^4)}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3} = \\frac{\\gamma_\\beta^4 \\gamma_v^4 q^2 a^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3 \\gamma_\\beta^4} = \\frac{\\gamma_v^4 q^2 a^2}{6\\pi\\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\label{eq:P1prime_is_P1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nComparing this with Eq. \\eqref{eq:P1_S}, we find that $P'_1 = P_1$. The instantaneous radiated power from a single particle is a Lorentz invariant for this specific configuration of motion and boost direction.\n\n### Step 5: Total Radiated Power per Unit Length in Frame S'\nTo find the total power per unit length in frame $S'$, $P'$, we must integrate the power from a single charge, $P'_1$, over the charge distribution as observed in $S'$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions:**\nThe number of particles is a Lorentz invariant scalar:\n\\[\\boxed{ dN' = dN }\\]\nA length element $dL$ parallel to the boost contracts:\n\\[\\boxed{ dL' = dL/\\gamma_\\beta }\\]\nThe number density in frame $S'$ is defined as:\n\\[\\boxed{ n' = \\frac{dN'}{dV'} }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe volume element in frame S is $dV = dV_\\perp dL$, where $dV_\\perp = dx dy$ is the transverse area element. In frame S', the transverse dimensions are unchanged, $dV'_\\perp = dV_\\perp$, while the longitudinal length contracts. Thus, the volume element transforms as $dV' = dV'_\\perp dL' = dV_\\perp (dL/\\gamma_\\beta) = dV/\\gamma_\\beta$. The number density in $S'$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn' = \\frac{dN'}{dV'} = \\frac{dN}{dV/\\gamma_\\beta} = \\gamma_\\beta \\frac{dN}{dV} = \\gamma_\\beta n \\label{eq:n_prime}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe total power per unit length in $S'$ is the integral of $P'_1$ multiplied by the number of particles per unit length in $S'$. The number of particles per unit length in $S'$ in a shell of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$ is $\\frac{dN'(r)}{dL'} = \\frac{dN(r)}{dL/\\gamma_\\beta} = \\gamma_\\beta \\frac{dN(r)}{dL} = \\gamma_\\beta (2\\pi n r dr)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP' &= \\int_0^R P'_1(r) \\left(\\gamma_\\beta n (2\\pi r dr)\\right) \\label{eq:Pprime_integral}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing the result $P'_1(r) = P_1(r)$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:P1prime_is_P1}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP' &= \\int_0^R P_1(r) (\\gamma_\\beta n) (2\\pi r dr) = \\gamma_\\beta \\int_0^R P_1(r) n (2\\pi r dr) \\label{eq:Pprime_derivation}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe integral on the right is precisely the total power per unit length in frame S, $P_S$, as calculated in Step 2 (Eq. \\eqref{eq:PS_integral}).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP' = \\gamma_\\beta P_S \\label{eq:Pprime_vs_PS}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the result for $P_S$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:PS_final}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP' &= \\gamma_\\beta \\frac{n q^2 c}{6\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{(\\omega R/c)^2}{1-(\\omega R/c)^2} + \\ln\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 R^2}{c^2}\\right) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}} \\frac{n q^2 c}{6\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{\\omega^2 R^2/c^2}{1-\\omega^2 R^2/c^2} + \\ln\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 R^2}{c^2}\\right) \\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe radiation power per unit length of the rod in frame $S^{\\prime}$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{P' = \\frac{n q^2 c}{6\\varepsilon_0 \\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}} \\left[ \\frac{\\omega^2 R^2/c^2}{1-\\omega^2 R^2/c^2} + \\ln\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 R^2}{c^2}\\right) \\right]}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

A uniform rigid circular ring with mass $M$, radius $R$, and carrying a steady current $I$.\n2.  A fixed magnetic dipole with a magnetic dipole moment $\\vec{m}$, located on the axis of the ring at a distance $h$ from its center.\n\nThe physical setup and process are as follows:\n*   We define a laboratory coordinate system $K(x, y, z)$ with the center of the ring at the origin $(0,0,0)$. The ring is constrained to rotate about a diameter, which we align with the y-axis.\n*   The magnetic dipole is located at the point $(0,0,h)$ on the z-axis. Its magnetic moment is fixed and points along the z-axis, so $\\vec{m} = m\\hat{k}$.\n*   The initial equilibrium position is when the plane of the ring is in the x-y plane. In this configuration, the ring's axis is aligned with the z-axis.\n*   The problem states this is a stable equilibrium. It also states that the magnetic field produced by the ring at the dipole's location is in the same direction as the dipole moment $\\vec{m}$. The field of the ring on its axis is along the axis, so this condition confirms that the interaction provides a restoring torque for small displacements.\n*   The ring is then rotated by a small angle $\\theta$ about the y-axis. After being released, it undergoes simple harmonic motion.\n*   The goal is to find the period $T_1$ of this oscillation. We will use the small angle approximation (e.g., $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$, $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1 - \\theta^2/2$). The vacuum permeability is given as $\\mu_0$.\n\n### Step 1: Coordinate Systems and Transformations\nTo analyze the interaction, we use two coordinate systems:\n1.  The **Lab Frame** $K(x,y,z)$, which is fixed in space as described above.\n2.  The **Ring Frame** $K'(x',y',z')$, which is fixed to the ring and rotates with it. In this frame, the ring always lies in the $x'-y'$ plane, and its axis is the $z'$-axis.\n\nWhen the ring rotates by an angle $\\theta$ about the y-axis, the coordinates of a point in the lab frame $(x,y,z)$ are related to its coordinates in the ring frame $(x',y',z')$ by a rotation matrix.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = R_y(\\theta) \\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & 0 & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix}}\n\\]\nThe fixed magnetic dipole is at position $\\vec{r}_{lab} = (0,0,h)$ in the lab frame. To find its coordinates in the ring frame, we apply the inverse transformation $\\vec{r}_{ring} = R_y(-\\theta)\\vec{r}_{lab}$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} &= \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(-\\theta) & 0 & \\sin(-\\theta) \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin(-\\theta) & 0 & \\cos(-\\theta) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ h \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ h \\end{pmatrix} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} -h\\sin\\theta \\\\ 0 \\\\ h\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\label{eq:dipole_pos_ring_frame}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn the cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi', z')$ of the ring's frame, the dipole's position is given by $\\rho = \\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2} = h|\\sin\\theta|$ and $z' = h\\cos\\theta$.\n\n### Step 2: Magnetic Field Expansion Near the Axis\nThe magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ from the current loop in the source-free region near its axis can be approximated. The field is governed by Maxwell's equations for magnetostatics.\n\\[\\boxed{\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = 0}\\]\nFor an axisymmetric field in cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, and with no azimuthal component ($B_\\phi=0$), these equations become:\n1.  $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial(\\rho B_\\rho)}{\\partial \\rho} + \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z} = 0$\n2.  $(\\nabla \\times \\vec{B})_\\phi = \\frac{\\partial B_\\rho}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial \\rho} = 0$\n\nFor small radial distances $\\rho$ from the axis, we can expand the field components. From the first equation, we approximate $\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}$ by its on-axis value, $\\frac{d B_z(0, z)}{dz}$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial(\\rho B_\\rho)}{\\partial \\rho} &= -\\rho \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z} \\approx -\\rho \\frac{d B_z(0, z)}{dz} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{Integrating w.r.t } \\rho \\text{ from } 0 \\text{ to } \\rho: \\quad \\rho B_\\rho(\\rho, z) &\\approx -\\frac{\\rho^2}{2} \\frac{d B_z(0, z)}{dz} \\nonumber \\\\\nB_\\rho(\\rho, z) &\\approx -\\frac{\\rho}{2} \\frac{d B_z(0, z)}{dz} \\label{eq:B_rho_expansion}\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing a Taylor expansion for $B_z(\\rho, z)$ about $\\rho=0$ and the magnetostatics equations, we find:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nB_z(\\rho, z) \\approx B_z(0, z) - \\frac{\\rho^2}{4} \\frac{d^2 B_z(0, z)}{dz^2} \\label{eq:B_z_expansion}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThese approximations are valid for small $\\rho$, which corresponds to the small angle of rotation $\\theta$ in our problem.\n\n### Step 3: Field Calculation at the Dipole's Location\nThe magnetic field of a circular current loop of radius $R$ and current $I$ along its axis ($z'$-axis in the ring frame) is given by the Biot-Savart law. Let $B_0(z') \\equiv B_{z'}(0, z')$.\n\\[\n\\boxed{B_0(z') = \\frac{\\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + z'^2)^{3/2}}}\n\\]\nWe compute the first and second derivatives with respect to $z'$, which we denote as $B_0'(z')$ and $B_0''(z')$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nB_0'(z') = \\frac{d B_0(z')}{dz'} &= -\\frac{3 \\mu_0 I R^2 z'}{2(R^2 + z'^2)^{5/2}} \\label{eq:B_deriv1} \\\\\nB_0''(z') = \\frac{d^2 B_0(z')}{dz'^2} &= \\frac{3 \\mu_0 I R^2 (4z'^2 - R^2)}{2(R^2 + z'^2)^{7/2}} \\label{eq:B_deriv2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThese expressions will be evaluated at $z'=h$ for the equilibrium position and used in the expansion for the rotated position.\n\n### Step 4: Interaction Potential Energy\nThe potential energy $W$ of a magnetic dipole $\\vec{m}$ in an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{W = -\\vec{m} \\cdot \\vec{B}}\n\\]\nHere, $\\vec{m} = m\\hat{k}$ is the dipole moment in the lab frame, and $\\vec{B} = \\vec{B}_{ring}$ is the magnetic field from the ring evaluated at the dipole's position. To compute the dot product, we must express $\\vec{B}_{ring}$ in the lab frame. In the ring frame, the field is $\\vec{B}_{ring}' = B_\\rho \\hat{e}_\\rho + B_{z'} \\hat{k}'$. For a small positive rotation $\\theta$, the dipole is at $x'=-h\\sin\\theta$, so its radial unit vector is $\\hat{e}_\\rho = -\\hat{i}'$. Thus, $\\vec{B}_{ring}' = -B_\\rho \\hat{i}' + B_{z'} \\hat{k}'$. We transform this vector to the lab frame using the rotation matrix $R_y(\\theta)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{B}_{ring} &= -B_\\rho(\\cos\\theta \\hat{i} - \\sin\\theta \\hat{k}) + B_{z'}(\\sin\\theta \\hat{i} + \\cos\\theta \\hat{k}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (-B_\\rho\\cos\\theta + B_{z'}\\sin\\theta)\\hat{i} + (B_\\rho\\sin\\theta + B_{z'}\\cos\\theta)\\hat{k} \\label{eq:B_lab_frame}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe potential energy is the dot product of $\\vec{m}=m\\hat{k}$ with $-\\vec{B}_{ring}$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nW(\\theta) = -(m\\hat{k}) \\cdot \\vec{B}_{ring} = -m (B_\\rho\\sin\\theta + B_{z'}\\cos\\theta) \\label{eq:W_general}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere $B_\\rho$ and $B_{z'}$ are functions of $\\theta$ via their dependence on $\\rho=h|\\sin\\theta|$ and $z'=h\\cos\\theta$.\n\n### Step 5: Potential Energy Expansion and Torsional Constant\nFor small oscillations about a stable equilibrium point $\\theta=0$, the potential energy can be approximated by a quadratic function, where $k_r$ is the torsional constant.\n\\[\\boxed{W(\\theta) \\approx W(0) + \\frac{1}{2}k_r \\theta^2}\\]\nWe find $k_r$ by performing a Taylor expansion of $W(\\theta)$ up to the second order in $\\theta$. We use the small angle approximations: $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$, $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}$. The dipole's coordinates in the ring frame become $\\rho \\approx h\\theta$ and $z' \\approx h(1-\\frac{\\theta^2}{2})$. The field components $B_\\rho$ and $B_{z'}$ at $(\\rho, z')$ are expanded around the on-axis point $(0, h)$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nB_\\rho(\\rho, z') &\\approx -\\frac{\\rho}{2} B_0'(z') \\approx -\\frac{h\\theta}{2} B_0'(h) \\\\\nB_{z'}(\\rho, z') &\\approx B_0(z') - \\frac{\\rho^2}{4} B_0''(z') \\approx \\left(B_0(h) + (z'-h)B_0'(h)\\right) - \\frac{(h\\theta)^2}{4}B_0''(h) \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx B_0(h) - \\frac{h\\theta^2}{2}B_0'(h) - \\frac{h^2\\theta^2}{4}B_0''(h)\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression, Eq. \\eqref{eq:W_general}, and keeping terms up to $\\theta^2$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nW(\\theta) &\\approx -m \\left[ \\left(-\\frac{h\\theta}{2}B_0'(h)\\right)(\\theta) + \\left(B_0(h) - \\frac{h\\theta^2}{2}B_0'(h) - \\frac{h^2\\theta^2}{4}B_0''(h)\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\theta^2}{2}\\right) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx -m \\left[ -\\frac{h\\theta^2}{2}B_0'(h) + B_0(h) - \\frac{h\\theta^2}{2}B_0'(h) - \\frac{h^2\\theta^2}{4}B_0''(h) - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}B_0(h) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -m B_0(h) + \\theta^2 \\cdot m \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}B_0(h) + hB_0'(h) + \\frac{h^2}{4}B_0''(h) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -m B_0(h) + \\frac{1}{2} \\theta^2 \\cdot m \\left[ B_0(h) + 2hB_0'(h) + \\frac{h^2}{2}B_0''(h) \\right] \\label{eq:W_expansion}\n\\end{align}\\]\nComparing with the standard form, we identify the torsional constant:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nk_r = m \\left( B_0(h) + 2hB_0'(h) + \\frac{h^2}{2}B_0''(h) \\right) \\label{eq:kr_simple}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting the expressions for the field and its derivatives from Step 3, evaluated at $z'=h$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk_r &= m \\left[ \\frac{\\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2+h^2)^{3/2}} + 2h\\left(\\frac{-3 \\mu_0 I R^2 h}{2(R^2 + h^2)^{5/2}}\\right) + \\frac{h^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{3 \\mu_0 I R^2 (4h^2 - R^2)}{2(R^2 + h^2)^{7/2}}\\right) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{m\\mu_0 I R^2}{4(R^2+h^2)^{7/2}} \\left[ 2(R^2+h^2)^2 - 12h^2(R^2+h^2) + 3h^2(4h^2-R^2) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{m\\mu_0 I R^2}{4(R^2+h^2)^{7/2}} \\left[ 2(R^4+2R^2h^2+h^4) - 12R^2h^2-12h^4 + 12h^4-3R^2h^2 \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{m\\mu_0 I R^2 (2R^4 - 11R^2h^2 + 2h^4)}{4(R^2+h^2)^{7/2}} \\label{eq:kr_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe problem states that the equilibrium is stable, which implies $k_r > 0$. Thus, the parameters must satisfy $2R^4 - 11R^2h^2 + 2h^4 > 0$.\n\n### Step 6: Moment of Inertia\nThe ring rotates about one of its diameters. The moment of inertia $J$ for this rotation can be found using the perpendicular axis theorem for a planar object.\n\\[\n\\boxed{J_z = J_x + J_y \\quad (\\text{Perpendicular Axis Theorem})}\n\\]\nHere, $J_z$ is the moment of inertia about the axis perpendicular to the ring's plane and passing through its center, which is $J_z = MR^2$. $J_x$ and $J_y$ are the moments of inertia about two perpendicular diameters in the plane of the ring. For a uniform ring, the moment of inertia about any diameter is the same, so $J_x = J_y = J$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nMR^2 &= J + J = 2J \\nonumber \\\\\n\\implies J &= \\frac{1}{2}MR^2 \\label{eq:Inertia}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Period of Simple Harmonic Motion\nThe equation of motion for small angular displacements $\\theta$ is $J\\ddot{\\theta} = -k_r\\theta$. This is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_r}{J}}}\n\\]\nThe period of oscillation $T_1$ is related to the angular frequency by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{T_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{J}{k_r}}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expressions for the moment of inertia $J$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:Inertia} and the torsional constant $k_r$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:kr_final}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nT_1 &= 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}MR^2}{\\frac{m\\mu_0 I R^2 (2R^4 - 11R^2h^2 + 2h^4)}{4(R^2+h^2)^{7/2}}}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{MR^2}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4(R^2+h^2)^{7/2}}{m\\mu_0 I R^2 (2R^4 - 11R^2h^2 + 2h^4)}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2M(h^2+R^2)^{7/2}}{\\mu_0 m I (2R^4 - 11R^2h^2 + 2h^4)}} \\label{eq:T1_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe period $T_1$ of the simple harmonic vibration of the ring is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{T_1 = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2M(h^2+R^2)^{7/2}}{\\mu_0 m I (2R^4 - 11R^2h^2 + 2h^4)}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}
{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "tag": "MECHANICS", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved.

The precession arises because the gravitational potential experienced by the planet deviates from the ideal inverse-square law force field of a single central body.\n\n**Physical System and Variables:**\n*   **Binary Stars:** Two stars, Saka and Juipte, with known masses $M_S$ and $M_J$. They are in a stable circular orbit around their common center of mass (COM).\n*   **Binary System Parameters:**\n    *   $\\Omega$: The known angular frequency of the binary's orbit.\n    *   $R_S, R_J$: The respective orbital radii of the stars about the COM (initially unknown).\n    *   $R_0$: The constant distance between the two stars, $R_0 = R_S + R_J$ (initially unknown).\n*   **Planet:** A planet of known mass $m$ orbits the COM of the binary system.\n*   **Planet's Orbital Parameters:**\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the planet from the COM.\n    *   $E$: The total energy of the planet, given as $E < 0$ (indicating a bound orbit).\n    *   $L$: The magnitude of the planet's orbital angular momentum, $\\vec{L}$.\n*   **Constants:** $G$ is the universal gravitational constant.\n\n**Physical Process and Assumptions:**\n1.  **Gravitational Interaction:** The stars orbit each other due to their mutual gravitational attraction. The planet orbits the binary system due to the combined gravitational pull of both stars.\n2.  **Scale Separation:** The size of the binary system is much smaller than the planet's orbital distance, i.e., $R_0 \\ll r$. This allows us to use a multipole expansion for the gravitational potential and keep only the lowest-order correction term.\n3.  **Time Scale Separation:** The orbital period of the binary system ($T_\\Omega = 2\\pi/\\Omega$) is much shorter than the planet's orbital period. This justifies time-averaging the rapidly changing potential from the moving stars to find an effective, static potential $V_{\\text{eff}}$ that governs the planet's long-term motion. During this averaging, the planet's position $\\vec{r}$ is considered fixed.\n4.  **Coplanar Orbits:** The planet's orbit and the binary stars' orbit lie in the same plane. This simplifies the geometry for the time-averaging calculation.\n5.  **Perturbation Theory:** The effective potential is treated as a sum of a dominant central potential, $V_0 = -G(M_S+M_J)m/r$, and a small perturbing potential, $\\delta V$. The precession is calculated based on the effect of this perturbation.\n\n**Key Definitions and Formulas (from problem hints):**\n*   **Laplace-Runge-Lenz (LRL) Vector:** Defined for this system as $\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}$, where $\\vec{v}$ is the planet's velocity and $\\hat{r} = \\vec{r}/r$. For the unperturbed potential $V_0$, this vector is denoted $\\vec{B}_0$ and is conserved.\n*   **Precession Angle ($\\Delta\\alpha$):** The precession angle per orbit is calculated using the change in the LRL vector over one planetary orbit ($\\Delta\\vec{B}$):\n    $$ \\Delta\\alpha \\approx \\frac{|\\vec{B}_{0} \\times \\Delta\\vec{B}|}{|\\vec{B}_{0}|^{2}} $$\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to derive an expression for the precession angle $\\Delta\\alpha$ in terms of the given quantities: $M_J, M_S, G, \\Omega, m, L$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Binary Star System\nWe first establish the relationship between the properties of the binary system (masses, separation, and orbital frequency). The mutual gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force for each star's circular motion about the center of mass (COM).\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n\\[\\boxed{F_g = \\frac{Gm_1 m_2}{d^2}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{F_c = m a_c = m \\omega^2 R}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{M_S \\vec{r}_S + M_J \\vec{r}_J = \\vec{0} \\quad (\\text{with origin at the COM})}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nLet the COM be the origin. The stars are on opposite sides of the origin, so their position vectors are anti-parallel. The distance between them is $R_0 = R_S + R_J$. The COM condition implies $M_S R_S = M_J R_J$. The gravitational force on each star has magnitude $F_g = G M_S M_J / R_0^2$. This force provides the centripetal force for each star's orbit.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{For star Saka (S): } \\quad &\\frac{G M_S M_J}{R_0^2} = M_S \\Omega^2 R_S \\label{eq:force_S} \\tag{1} \\\\\n\\text{For star Juipte (J): } \\quad &\\frac{G M_S M_J}{R_0^2} = M_J \\Omega^2 R_J \\label{eq:force_J} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nDividing Eq. \\eqref{eq:force_S} by $M_S$ and Eq. \\eqref{eq:force_J} by $M_J$ and adding them gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{G M_J}{R_0^2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{G M_S}{R_0^2}\\right) &= \\Omega^2 R_S + \\Omega^2 R_J \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{G(M_S+M_J)}{R_0^2} &= \\Omega^2 (R_S+R_J) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{G(M_S+M_J)}{R_0^2} &= \\Omega^2 R_0 \\label{eq:kepler_binary} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is Kepler's Third Law for the binary system. We can solve for the separation distance $R_0$, which will be needed later:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nR_0^3 = \\frac{G(M_S+M_J)}{\\Omega^2} \\implies R_0 = \\left(\\frac{G(M_S+M_J)}{\\Omega^2}\\right)^{1/3} \\label{eq:R0} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Effective Potential for the Planet\nWe find the gravitational potential energy of the planet due to the two moving stars. We then time-average this potential over one binary orbit, using the time-scale separation assumption, to find the effective potential $V_{\\text{eff}} = V_0 + \\delta V$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n\\[\\boxed{V_g = -\\frac{GMm}{d}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{1}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} = \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{r'}{r}\\right)^l P_l(\\cos\\gamma) \\quad (\\text{Legendre Expansion for } r' < r)}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{P_0(x)=1, \\quad P_1(x)=x, \\quad P_2(x)=\\frac{1}{2}(3x^2-1)}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\langle f(t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T f(t) dt, \\quad \\text{specifically } \\langle \\cos^2(\\omega t + \\delta) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe instantaneous potential energy of the planet at position $\\vec{r}$ due to the stars at $\\vec{r}_S(t)$ and $\\vec{r}_J(t)$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV(t) = -\\frac{G M_J m}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_J(t)|} - \\frac{G M_S m}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_S(t)|} \\label{eq:V_exact} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing the Legendre expansion for $R_S, R_J \\ll r$, we expand up to the $l=2$ term. Let $\\phi(t)$ be the angle between $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{r}_J(t)$. Since $\\vec{r}_S$ is anti-parallel to $\\vec{r}_J$, the angle between $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{r}_S(t)$ is $\\pi - \\phi(t)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV(t) \\approx -\\frac{Gm}{r} \\left[ M_J\\left(1 + \\frac{R_J}{r}P_1(\\cos\\phi) + \\frac{R_J^2}{r^2}P_2(\\cos\\phi)\\right) + M_S\\left(1 + \\frac{R_S}{r}P_1(\\cos(\\pi-\\phi)) + \\frac{R_S^2}{r^2}P_2(\\cos(\\pi-\\phi))\\right) \\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing $P_1(-x)=-x$ and $P_2(-x)=P_2(x)$, the $l=1$ (dipole) terms are proportional to $M_J R_J - M_S R_S$, which is zero by the COM condition. The potential becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV(t) \\approx -\\frac{G(M_J+M_S)m}{r} - \\frac{Gm}{r^3}(M_J R_J^2 + M_S R_S^2)P_2(\\cos\\phi(t)) \\label{eq:V_expanded} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe effective potential $V_{\\text{eff}}$ is the time average of $V(t)$ over one binary period $T_\\Omega$. For coplanar orbits, $\\phi(t) = \\Omega t - \\theta_p$, where $\\theta_p$ is the planet's (fixed) angular position.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle P_2(\\cos\\phi(t)) \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{3\\cos^2(\\Omega t - \\theta_p)-1}{2} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{3\\langle\\cos^2(\\Omega t - \\theta_p)\\rangle-1}{2} = \\frac{3(1/2)-1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe time-averaged potential is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_{\\text{eff}} = \\langle V(t) \\rangle = -\\frac{G(M_J+M_S)m}{r} - \\frac{Gm}{4r^3}(M_J R_J^2 + M_S R_S^2) \\label{eq:V_eff_intermediate} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe simplify the term $M_J R_J^2 + M_S R_S^2$ using $R_S = \\frac{M_J R_0}{M_S+M_J}$ and $R_J = \\frac{M_S R_0}{M_S+M_J}$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nM_J R_J^2 + M_S R_S^2 = M_J \\left(\\frac{M_S R_0}{M_S+M_J}\\right)^2 + M_S \\left(\\frac{M_J R_0}{M_S+M_J}\\right)^2 = \\frac{M_S M_J R_0^2 (M_S+M_J)}{(M_S+M_J)^2} = \\frac{M_S M_J}{M_S+M_J}R_0^2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting this back, we identify the zeroth-order potential $V_0$ and the perturbation $\\delta V$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_{\\text{eff}} &= \\underbrace{-\\frac{G(M_J+M_S)m}{r}}_{V_0} \\underbrace{- \\frac{G M_J M_S m R_0^2}{4(M_J+M_S)r^3}}_{\\delta V} \\label{eq:V_eff_final} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Unperturbed Orbit and LRL Vector\nFor the unperturbed potential $V_0 = -G(M_S+M_J)m/r$, the motion is a standard Keplerian ellipse. We find the magnitude of the corresponding LRL vector $\\vec{B}_0$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n\\[\\boxed{r(\\theta) = \\frac{p}{1+e\\cos\\theta}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{p = \\frac{L^2}{G(M_S+M_J)m^2}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{B}_0 = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_J + M_S)m\\hat{r}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe LRL vector $\\vec{B}_0$ is conserved for the unperturbed motion and points towards the periapsis (point of closest approach). We find its magnitude by evaluating it at this point, where the velocity $\\vec{v}_p$ is perpendicular to the position vector $\\vec{r}_p$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{v}_p \\times \\vec{L} = \\vec{v}_p \\times (m\\vec{r}_p \\times \\vec{v}_p) = m[\\vec{r}_p(\\vec{v}_p\\cdot\\vec{v}_p) - \\vec{v}_p(\\vec{r}_p\\cdot\\vec{v}_p)] = m v_p^2 \\vec{r}_p = m v_p^2 r_p \\hat{r} \\label{eq:vL_peri} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom angular momentum conservation, $L = m r_p v_p$, which implies $v_p = L/(mr_p)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{v}_p \\times \\vec{L} = m \\left(\\frac{L}{mr_p}\\right)^2 r_p \\hat{r} = \\frac{L^2}{mr_p} \\hat{r} \\label{eq:vL_final} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\vec{B}_0$ evaluated at periapsis:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{B}_0 &= \\left(\\frac{L^2}{mr_p} - G(M_J+M_S)m\\right)\\hat{r} \\label{eq:B0_intermediate} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing the orbit equation at periapsis, $r_p = p/(1+e)$, and the formula for the semi-latus rectum $p$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{L^2}{mr_p} &= \\frac{L^2}{m} \\frac{1+e}{p} = \\frac{L^2}{m} \\frac{1+e}{L^2/(G(M_S+M_J)m^2)} = G(M_S+M_J)m(1+e) \\label{eq:L2_mrp} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nPlugging this back into Eq. \\eqref{eq:B0_intermediate}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{B}_0 &= \\left(G(M_S+M_J)m(1+e) - G(M_S+M_J)m\\right)\\hat{r} = G(M_S+M_J)m e \\hat{r} \\label{eq:B0_final} \\tag{13}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe magnitude of the unperturbed LRL vector is therefore $|\\vec{B}_0| = G(M_S+M_J)m e$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Change in the LRL Vector\nThe perturbing potential $\\delta V$ gives rise to a perturbing force $\\vec{F}_\\delta = -\\nabla(\\delta V)$. This force is central, so angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ is still conserved. However, the LRL vector $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved.

We are asked to find the magnitude of an \"image\" magnetic dipole that can be used to model the magnetic field outside the sphere.\n\nThe physical setup and variables are as follows:\n*   **Coordinate System:** We define a Cartesian coordinate system with its origin (0,0,0) at the center of the superconducting sphere. The z-axis passes through the magnetic needle.\n*   **Magnetic Needle:** A small magnetic needle with a magnetic moment vector `\\mathbf{m}` is located at `(0, 0, a)` on the z-axis, where `a > R`. The moment is aligned with the z-axis, so `\\mathbf{m} = m \\mathbf{e}_z`, where `m` is the magnitude of the magnetic moment.\n*   **Superconducting Sphere:** A sphere of radius `R` is centered at the origin. Because it is a superconductor, it exhibits the Meissner effect, meaning the magnetic field inside it is zero (`\\mathbf{B}_{in} = 0`). A consequence of this, from magnetostatic boundary conditions, is that the component of the total magnetic field normal to the surface must be zero just outside the sphere. That is, `\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{total}} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0` on the surface `r=R`, where `\\mathbf{n}` is the outward normal vector.\n*   **Method of Images:** The problem states that the magnetic field outside the sphere is the superposition of the field from the original dipole `\\mathbf{m}` and an image dipole `\\mathbf{m'}` located inside the sphere. Due to the axial symmetry of the problem, this image dipole must also lie on the z-axis, say at a position `z=b` (where `|b|<R`), and its moment must be directed along the z-axis. We can write `\\mathbf{m'} = m'_{\\text{scalar}} \\mathbf{e}_z`, where `m'_{\\text{scalar}}` is a scalar value we need to determine.\n*   **Given Formula:** The magnetic field `\\mathbf{B}` from a dipole with moment `\\mathbf{M}` (magnitude `M`) is given in spherical coordinates `(r, \\theta)` relative to the dipole's position and axis: `\\mathbf{B}={ \\frac{ \\mu_{0}M}{4 \\pi r^{3}}}{ \\left(2 \\cos \\theta \\mathbf{e}_{r}+ \\sin \\theta \\mathbf{e}_{ \\theta} \\right)}`.\n*   **Objective:** Our goal is to find the magnitude of the image magnetic moment, `m' = |m'_{\\text{scalar}}|`.\n\n### Step 1: Apply the Boundary Condition at the Top Pole of the Sphere\nWe will use the boundary condition `\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{total}} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0` at specific points on the sphere's surface to solve for the unknowns `b` and `m'_{\\text{scalar}}`. A convenient point is the top pole, P, located at `(0, 0, R)`.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nThe total magnetic field is the vector sum of the fields from the original and image dipoles (Principle of Superposition):\n\\[\\boxed{ \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathbf{B}_{m} + \\mathbf{B}_{m'} }\\]\nThe magnetic field of a dipole of moment magnitude `M` is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{ \\mathbf{B}={ \\frac{ \\mu_{0}M}{4 \\pi r^{3}}}{ \\left(2 \\cos \\theta \\mathbf{e}_{r}+ \\sin \\theta \\mathbf{e}_{ \\theta} \\right)} }\\]\nThe boundary condition on the surface of the superconductor is:\n\\[\\boxed{ \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{total}} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0 }\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nFirst, we simplify the general dipole field formula for points along the dipole's axis. For a dipole `\\mathbf{M} = M \\mathbf{e}_z`, any point on its axis has a polar angle `\\theta = 0` or `\\theta = \\pi`. For `\\theta=0`, `\\cos(0)=1` and `\\sin(0)=0`. The radial unit vector from the dipole, `\\mathbf{e}_r`, is parallel to `\\mathbf{e}_z`. The formula becomes:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{axis}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 M}{4\\pi r^3} (2(1)\\mathbf{e}_z + 0) = \\frac{\\mu_0 M}{2\\pi r^3} \\mathbf{e}_z \\label{eq:B_axis} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere `r` is the distance from the dipole.\n\nAt the top pole P `(0, 0, R)`, the outward normal vector is `\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{e}_z`.\n*   The field from `\\mathbf{m}` (at `z=a`) at P is on-axis. The distance is `r_m = a-R`.\n    `\\mathbf{B}_m(P) = \\frac{\\mu_0 m}{2\\pi (a-R)^3} \\mathbf{e}_z`.\n*   The field from `\\mathbf{m'}` (at `z=b`) at P is also on-axis. The distance is `r_{m'} = R-b`.\n    `\\mathbf{B}_{m'}(P) = \\frac{\\mu_0 m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{2\\pi (R-b)^3} \\mathbf{e}_z`.\nThe boundary condition `(\\mathbf{B}_m(P) + \\mathbf{B}_{m'}(P)) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0` gives:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 m}{2\\pi (a-R)^3} \\mathbf{e}_z + \\frac{\\mu_0 m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{2\\pi (R-b)^3} \\mathbf{e}_z \\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_z &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{m}{(a-R)^3} + \\frac{m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{(R-b)^3} &= 0 \\label{eq:pole_P} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Boundary Condition at the Bottom Pole of the Sphere\nTo find our second equation, we apply the boundary condition at another convenient point, the bottom pole, Q, located at `(0, 0, -R)`.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nThe principles are the same as in Step 1.\n\n**Derivation**\nAt the bottom pole Q `(0, 0, -R)`, the outward normal vector is `\\mathbf{n} = -\\mathbf{e}_z`.\n*   The field from `\\mathbf{m}` (at `z=a`) at Q is on-axis. The distance is `r_m = a - (-R) = a+R`.\n    `\\mathbf{B}_m(Q) = \\frac{\\mu_0 m}{2\\pi (a+R)^3} \\mathbf{e}_z`.\n*   The field from `\\mathbf{m'}` (at `z=b`) at Q is also on-axis. The distance is `r_{m'} = b - (-R) = b+R`.\n    `\\mathbf{B}_{m'}(Q) = \\frac{\\mu_0 m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{2\\pi (b+R)^3} \\mathbf{e}_z`.\nThe boundary condition `(\\mathbf{B}_m(Q) + \\mathbf{B}_{m'}(Q)) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0` gives:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 m}{2\\pi (a+R)^3} \\mathbf{e}_z + \\frac{\\mu_0 m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{2\\pi (b+R)^3} \\mathbf{e}_z \\right) \\cdot (-\\mathbf{e}_z) &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n-\\left( \\frac{m}{(a+R)^3} + \\frac{m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{(b+R)^3} \\right) &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{m}{(a+R)^3} + \\frac{m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{(b+R)^3} &= 0 \\label{eq:pole_Q} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the Position of the Image Dipole\nWe now have a system of two equations, (\\ref{eq:pole_P}) and (\\ref{eq:pole_Q}), with two unknowns, `b` and `m'_{\\text{scalar}}`. We first solve for the position `b` of the image dipole.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nWe use the system of algebraic equations derived in the previous steps.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\begin{cases} \\frac{m}{(a-R)^3} + \\frac{m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{(R-b)^3} = 0 \\\\ \\frac{m}{(a+R)^3} + \\frac{m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{(b+R)^3} = 0 \\end{cases} }\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nFrom equations (\\ref{eq:pole_P}) and (\\ref{eq:pole_Q}), we can express the ratio `m'_{\\text{scalar}}/m` in two ways:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{m} &= -\\frac{(R-b)^3}{(a-R)^3} \\label{eq:ratio1} \\tag{4} \\\\\n\\frac{m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{m} &= -\\frac{(R+b)^3}{(a+R)^3} \\label{eq:ratio2} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nEquating the right-hand sides of (\\ref{eq:ratio1}) and (\\ref{eq:ratio2}):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{(R-b)^3}{(a-R)^3} &= \\frac{(R+b)^3}{(a+R)^3} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{R-b}{a-R}\\right)^3 &= \\left(\\frac{R+b}{a+R}\\right)^3 \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking the real cube root of both sides, which is a valid step since the function `f(x)=x^3` is one-to-one for real numbers:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{R-b}{a-R} &= \\frac{R+b}{a+R} \\nonumber \\\\\n(R-b)(a+R) &= (R+b)(a-R) \\nonumber \\\\\nRa + R^2 - ba - bR &= Ra - R^2 + ba - bR \\nonumber \\\\\nR^2 - ba &= -R^2 + ba \\nonumber \\\\\n2R^2 &= 2ab \\nonumber \\\\\nb &= \\frac{R^2}{a} \\label{eq:b_pos} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSince `a > R`, it follows that `b < R`, confirming the image dipole is inside the sphere as required.\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Magnitude of the Image Dipole Moment\nNow we substitute the position `b` back into one of our expressions for `m'_{\\text{scalar}}` to find its value, and then determine its magnitude `m'`.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nWe use the relationship between the moments and positions found in the previous steps.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\frac{m'_{\\text{scalar}}}{m} = -\\frac{(R+b)^3}{(a+R)^3} }\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nUsing equation (\\ref{eq:ratio2}) and substituting the expression for `b` from (\\ref{eq:b_pos}):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm'_{\\text{scalar}} &= -m \\frac{(R+b)^3}{(a+R)^3} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -m \\frac{(R + R^2/a)^3}{(a+R)^3} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -m \\frac{\\left( \\frac{Ra+R^2}{a} \\right)^3}{(a+R)^3} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -m \\frac{\\left( \\frac{R(a+R)}{a} \\right)^3}{(a+R)^3} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -m \\frac{\\frac{R^3(a+R)^3}{a^3}}{(a+R)^3} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -m \\frac{R^3}{a^3} \\label{eq:m_scalar} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe negative sign indicates that the image dipole moment `\\mathbf{m'}` is directed opposite to the original dipole moment `\\mathbf{m}` (i.e., `\\mathbf{m'} = -m \\frac{R^3}{a^3} \\mathbf{e}_z`). The problem asks for the magnitude of `m'`, which is the absolute value of `m'_{\\text{scalar}}`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm' = |m'_{\\text{scalar}}| = \\left| -m \\frac{R^3}{a^3} \\right| = m \\frac{R^3}{a^3} \\label{eq:m_mag} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe magnitude of the image magnetic moment `m'` is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{m' = \\frac{R^3}{a^3} m}\n\\end{align}\\]"}

The state of the system is defined by its pressure $p$, molar volume $v$, and absolute temperature $T$. The behavior of this substance is constrained by three specific physical laws:\n\n1.  **Coefficient of Volume Expansion**: The coefficient of volume expansion, $\\alpha$, is given by the relation:\n    $$ \\alpha = \\frac{3}{T} $$\n2.  **Adiabatic Process Equation**: For any reversible adiabatic process (a process with zero heat exchange, $dS=0$), the system follows the equation:\n    $$ pv^2 = C $$\n    where $C$ is a constant specific to the particular adiabatic path.\n3.  **Isobaric Heat Capacity**: The molar heat capacity at constant pressure, $c_p$, is proportional to the term $\\frac{pv}{T}$. This can be expressed as:\n    $$ c_p = \\lambda \\frac{pv}{T} $$\n    where $\\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant that is independent of the state of the system.\n\nWe are given two equilibrium states of the system: an initial state A, characterized by known variables $(p_A, v_A, T_A)$, and a final state D, characterized by known variables $(p_D, v_D)$. The temperature of state D, $T_D$, is not explicitly given but is determined by the system's equation of state.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the change in molar entropy, $S_D - S_A$, as the system transitions from state A to state D.\n\n### Step 1: Derive the General Form of the Equation of State\nWe start by using the given expression for the coefficient of volume expansion, $\\alpha$, to determine the functional form of the system's equation of state. The definition of $\\alpha$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{v}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_p }\\]\nThe problem states that $\\alpha = 3/T$. Equating this with the definition gives a partial differential equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{v}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_p &= \\frac{3}{T} \\label{eq:alpha_given}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo solve for the relationship between $v$ and $T$ at constant pressure, we can treat this as an ordinary differential equation by holding $p$ constant and separating the variables.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{v} dv &= \\frac{3}{T} dT \\quad (\\text{for constant } p) \\label{eq:sep_var}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe integrate this equation. The constant of integration for the temperature integral will, in general, be a function of pressure, which we denote as $\\ln(h(p))$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int \\frac{1}{v} dv &= \\int \\frac{3}{T} dT \\nonumber \\\\\n\\ln(v) &= 3\\ln(T) + \\ln(h(p)) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\ln(v) &= \\ln(T^3 h(p)) \\nonumber \\\\\nv &= T^3 h(p) \\label{eq:eos_general}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis equation represents the general form of the equation of state that is consistent with the given coefficient of volume expansion. The specific form of the function $h(p)$ is yet to be determined.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Entropy Differential dS\nThe differential of molar entropy, $dS$, for a simple $p,v,T$ system can be expressed as a function of temperature $T$ and pressure $p$.\n\\[\\boxed{ dS = \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right)_p dT + \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial p}\\right)_T dp }\\]\nThe partial derivatives of entropy can be related to other thermodynamic properties using standard identities.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = \\frac{c_p}{T} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial p}\\right)_T = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_p \\quad (\\text{Maxwell's Relation}) }\\]\nWe use the information given in the problem to find expressions for these partial derivatives. From the given isobaric heat capacity, $c_p = \\lambda \\frac{pv}{T}$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = \\frac{1}{T} \\left(\\lambda \\frac{pv}{T}\\right) = \\lambda \\frac{pv}{T^2} \\label{eq:dSdT}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom the definition of $\\alpha$ and the given relation $\\alpha=3/T$, we have $(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T})_p = v\\alpha = 3v/T$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial p}\\right)_T = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = -\\frac{3v}{T} \\label{eq:dSdp}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting these expressions back into the total differential for entropy gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ndS = \\lambda \\frac{pv}{T^2} dT - \\frac{3v}{T} dp \\label{eq:dS_general}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Proportionality Constant $\\lambda$\nSince entropy $S$ is a state function, its differential $dS$ must be an exact differential. This implies that the mixed second partial derivatives of $S$ must be equal (Clairaut's theorem).\n\\[\\boxed{ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial p}\\right)_T }\\]\nWe apply this condition to the coefficients of $dT$ and $dp$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:dS_general}.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\left(\\lambda \\frac{pv}{T^2}\\right)_T &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(-\\frac{3v}{T}\\right)_p \\label{eq:schwartz_apply}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo evaluate these partial derivatives, we substitute the general equation of state $v = T^3 h(p)$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:eos_general}.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{LHS: } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\left(\\lambda \\frac{p(T^3 h(p))}{T^2}\\right)_T &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\left(\\lambda T p h(p)\\right)_T = \\lambda T \\left(h(p) + p h'(p)\\right) \\label{eq:lhs} \\\\\n\\text{RHS: } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(-\\frac{3(T^3 h(p))}{T}\\right)_p &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(-3 T^2 h(p)\\right)_p = -6 T h(p) \\label{eq:rhs}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEquating the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) yields a differential equation for $h(p)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lambda T (h(p) + p h'(p)) &= -6 T h(p) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lambda (h(p) + p h'(p)) &= -6 h(p) \\label{eq:h_de}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo solve for $\\lambda$, we need to determine the form of $h(p)$. We use the given adiabatic condition. For an adiabatic process:\n\\[\\boxed{ dS = 0 }\\]\nApplying this to Eq. \\eqref{eq:dS_general}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n0 &= \\lambda \\frac{pv}{T^2} dT - \\frac{3v}{T} dp \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lambda \\frac{p}{T} dT &= 3 dp \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{\\lambda}{3} \\frac{dT}{T} &= \\frac{dp}{p} \\label{eq:ad_rel_1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIntegrating this gives the temperature-pressure relationship for an adiabatic process: $T^{\\lambda/3} = (\\text{const}) \\cdot p$. We must reconcile this with the given adiabatic law $pv^2=C$. We use the general equation of state $v=T^3h(p)$, which implies $T=(v/h(p))^{1/3}$. Substituting this into our derived T-p relation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left( \\frac{v}{h(p)} \\right)^{\\lambda/9} = (\\text{const}) \\cdot p \\implies v^{\\lambda/9} = (\\text{const}) \\cdot p \\cdot (h(p))^{\\lambda/9} \\label{eq:ad_rel_2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom the given law $pv^2=C$, we have $v^2 \\propto p^{-1}$, so $v \\propto p^{-1/2}$. Raising this to the power of $\\lambda/9$ gives $v^{\\lambda/9} \\propto (p^{-1/2})^{\\lambda/9} = p^{-\\lambda/18}$. Comparing this with Eq. \\eqref{eq:ad_rel_2}, the dependence on $p$ must be the same:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np \\cdot (h(p))^{\\lambda/9} &\\propto p^{-\\lambda/18} \\nonumber \\\\\n(h(p))^{\\lambda/9} &\\propto p^{-1-\\lambda/18} = p^{-(\\lambda+18)/18} \\nonumber \\\\\nh(p) &\\propto \\left(p^{-(\\lambda+18)/18}\\right)^{9/\\lambda} = p^{-(\\lambda+18)/(2\\lambda)} \\label{eq:h_form}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we substitute this functional form, $h(p) \\propto p^n$ with $n = -(\\lambda+18)/(2\\lambda)$, into Eq. \\eqref{eq:h_de}. For $h(p) \\propto p^n$, we have $ph'(p) = n h(p)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lambda (h(p) + n h(p)) &= -6 h(p) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lambda (1+n) &= -6 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lambda \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda+18}{2\\lambda}\\right) &= -6 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lambda \\left(\\frac{2\\lambda - (\\lambda+18)}{2\\lambda}\\right) &= -6 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{\\lambda-18}{2} &= -6 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lambda - 18 &= -12 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lambda &= 6 \\label{eq:lambda_val}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe consistency of the three given physical laws uniquely determines the value of the proportionality constant to be $\\lambda=6$.\n\n### Step 4: Derive the Specific Equation of State\nWith $\\lambda=6$, we can find the specific form of the function $h(p)$ and thus the equation of state for the substance. We use the functional form derived in the previous step:\n\\[\\boxed{ h(p) = K p^n \\quad \\text{with} \\quad n = -(\\lambda+18)/(2\\lambda) }\\]\nSubstituting $\\lambda=6$ into the expression for the exponent $n$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn = -\\frac{6+18}{2 \\cdot 6} = -\\frac{24}{12} = -2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo, $h(p) = K p^{-2}$, where $K$ is a constant. Substituting this into the general equation of state, Eq. \\eqref{eq:eos_general}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv = T^3 (K p^{-2}) \\implies p^2 v = K T^3 \\label{eq:eos_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is the specific equation of state for the substance. The constant $K$ can be determined by applying the equation to the known state A $(p_A, v_A, T_A)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_A^2 v_A = K T_A^3 \\implies K = \\frac{p_A^2 v_A}{T_A^3} \\label{eq:K_const}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Entropy Change\nWe can now calculate the entropy change $S_D - S_A$ by integrating the entropy differential $dS$.\n\\[\\boxed{ S_D - S_A = \\int_A^D dS }\\]\nUsing the expression for $dS$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:dS_general} with $\\lambda=6$ and substituting the specific equation of state $v = K T^3 p^{-2}$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ndS &= 6 \\frac{pv}{T^2} dT - \\frac{3v}{T} dp \\nonumber \\\\\ndS &= 6 \\frac{p(K T^3 p^{-2})}{T^2} dT - \\frac{3(K T^3 p^{-2})}{T} dp \\nonumber \\\\\ndS &= 6 K T p^{-1} dT - 3 K T^2 p^{-2} dp \\label{eq:dS_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is an exact differential. We can find the entropy function $S(T, p)$ by integration. We can recognize that $d(T^2 p^{-1}) = 2T p^{-1} dT - T^2 p^{-2} dp$, so $dS = 3K d(T^2 p^{-1})$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nS(T, p) = 3K \\frac{T^2}{p} + S_0 \\label{eq:S_final}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $S_0$ is a constant of integration representing the reference entropy. The entropy change $S_D - S_A$ is the difference in this function between states D and A.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nS_D - S_A = \\left(3K \\frac{T_D^2}{p_D} + S_0\\right) - \\left(3K \\frac{T_A^2}{p_A} + S_0\\right) = 3K \\left(\\frac{T_D^2}{p_D} - \\frac{T_A^2}{p_A}\\right) \\label{eq:deltaS_intermediate}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo get the final answer in terms of the given variables, we eliminate $K$ and $T_D$. From the equation of state, Eq. \\eqref{eq:eos_final}, we have $\\frac{p^2 v}{T^3} = K$. Thus, for states A and D:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{p_D^2 v_D}{T_D^3} = K = \\frac{p_A^2 v_A}{T_A^3} \\implies T_D^3 = T_A^3 \\frac{p_D^2 v_D}{p_A^2 v_A} \\implies T_D^2 = T_A^2 \\left(\\frac{p_D^2 v_D}{p_A^2 v_A}\\right)^{2/3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow substitute $K$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:K_const} and the expression for $T_D^2$ into Eq. \\eqref{eq:deltaS_intermediate}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nS_D - S_A &= 3 \\left(\\frac{p_A^2 v_A}{T_A^3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{T_D^2}{p_D} - \\frac{T_A^2}{p_A}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 3 \\frac{p_A^2 v_A}{T_A^3} \\cdot T_A^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{p_D}\\frac{T_D^2}{T_A^2} - \\frac{1}{p_A}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 3 \\frac{p_A^2 v_A}{T_A} \\left(\\frac{1}{p_D}\\left(\\frac{p_D^2 v_D}{p_A^2 v_A}\\right)^{2/3} - \\frac{1}{p_A}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 3 \\frac{p_A v_A}{T_A} \\left(\\frac{p_A}{p_D}\\left(\\frac{p_D^2 v_D}{p_A^2 v_A}\\right)^{2/3} - 1\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 3 \\frac{p_A v_A}{T_A} \\left(p_A p_D^{-1} p_D^{4/3} p_A^{-4/3} v_D^{2/3} v_A^{-2/3} - 1\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 3 \\frac{p_A v_A}{T_A} \\left(p_A^{-1/3} p_D^{1/3} v_A^{-2/3} v_D^{2/3} - 1\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 3 \\frac{p_A v_A}{T_A} \\left(\\left(\\frac{p_D}{p_A}\\right)^{1/3} \\left(\\frac{v_D^2}{v_A^2}\\right)^{1/3} - 1\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 3 \\frac{p_A v_A}{T_A} \\left(\\left(\\frac{p_D v_D^2}{p_A v_A^2}\\right)^{1/3} - 1\\right) \\label{eq:deltaS_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe entropy change of state D compared to state A is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{S_D - S_A = 3 \\frac{p_A v_A}{T_A} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{p_D v_D^2}{p_A v_A^2}\\right)^{1/3} - 1 \\right]}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The Earth is modeled as a solid, incompressible body with a uniform density $\\rho$. Its initial spherical state is characterized by a radius $R$ and volume $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. The gravitational constant is $G$.\n\nThe deformation is caused by two effects:\n1.  **Earth's Rotation:** The Earth rotates with a constant angular velocity $\\omega$ about its polar axis.\n2.  **Tidal Forces:** The Moon is modeled as a homogeneous ring with total mass $m$ and radius $r$, located in the Earth's equatorial plane and centered at the Earth's center. It is assumed that the Moon's orbit is much larger than the Earth's size, i.e., $r \\gg R$.\n\nWe establish a coordinate system with the origin at the Earth's center. The z-axis is aligned with the polar axis of rotation, and the xy-plane is the equatorial plane, which also contains the Moon ring. The resulting oblate spheroid has a semi-major axis $a$ (in the equatorial plane) and a semi-minor axis $b$ (along the polar axis).\n\nThe relevant variables are:\n*   $e = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}{a}$: The eccentricity of the oblate spheroid.\n*   $a$: The semi-major axis (equatorial radius).\n*   $b$: The semi-minor axis (polar radius).\n*   $M = \\rho V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\rho R^3$: The total mass of the Earth.\n*   $(\\tilde{r}, \\theta, \\phi)$: Spherical coordinates, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.\n\nThe stable shape is achieved when the Earth is in hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning its surface is an equipotential surface for the combined potential fields. We assume the deformation is small, which implies that the eccentricity is small ($e \\ll 1$).\n\n### Step 1: Geometry of the Oblate Spheroid\nWe relate the semi-axes $a$ and $b$ of the oblate spheroid to the initial radius $R$ using the incompressibility condition (constant volume) and the definition of eccentricity.\n\\[\\boxed{V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^2 b = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{b^2 = a^2(1-e^2)}\\]\nFrom the incompressibility condition, we have $a^2 b = R^3$. Using the definition of eccentricity, we can express $b$ in terms of $a$ and $e$ as $b = a\\sqrt{1-e^2}$. Substituting this into the volume relation gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na^2 (a\\sqrt{1-e^2}) &= R^3 \\nonumber \\\\\na^3 (1-e^2)^{1/2} &= R^3 \\nonumber \\\\\na &= R (1-e^2)^{-1/6} \\label{eq:a_exact} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor a small eccentricity ($e \\ll 1$), we use the binomial approximation $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$ to find the semi-axes to second order in $e$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na &\\approx R \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{6}e^2\\right) \\label{eq:a_approx} \\tag{2} \\\\\nb &= a\\sqrt{1-e^2} \\approx R \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{6}e^2\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}e^2\\right) \\approx R \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{6}e^2 - \\frac{1}{2}e^2\\right) = R \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}e^2\\right) \\label{eq:b_approx} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe surface of the oblate spheroid is described by $\\frac{x^2+y^2}{a^2} + \\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1$. In spherical coordinates, the radius of the surface, $r'(\\theta)$, as a function of the polar angle $\\theta$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr'(\\theta)^2 &= \\frac{a^2 b^2}{b^2\\sin^2\\theta + a^2\\cos^2\\theta} = \\frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2(1-e^2)\\sin^2\\theta + a^2\\cos^2\\theta} = \\frac{b^2}{1-e^2\\sin^2\\theta} \\nonumber \\\\\nr'(\\theta) &= b(1-e^2\\sin^2\\theta)^{-1/2} \\approx b\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}e^2\\sin^2\\theta\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx R\\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}e^2\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}e^2\\sin^2\\theta\\right) \\approx R\\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}e^2+\\frac{1}{2}e^2\\sin^2\\theta\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= R\\left[1+e^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\theta-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right] = R\\left[1+e^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\cos^2\\theta)-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right] = R\\left[1+e^2\\left(\\frac{1}{6}-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos^2\\theta\\right)\\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= R\\left[1 - \\frac{e^2}{3}\\left(\\frac{3\\cos^2\\theta-1}{2}\\right)\\right] = R\\left(1 - \\frac{e^2}{3}P_2(\\cos\\theta)\\right) \\label{eq:r_prime} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere $P_2(\\cos\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(3\\cos^2\\theta-1)$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree 2.\n\n### Step 2: Principle of Hydrostatic Equilibrium\nFor a fluid body to be in a stable equilibrium configuration, its surface must be an equipotential surface. The total effective potential per unit mass, $U$, is the sum of the gravitational self-potential ($v_g$), the centrifugal potential due to rotation ($v_i$), and the tidal potential from the Moon ($v_t$).\n\\[\\boxed{U = v_g + v_i + v_t}\\]\nThe condition for hydrostatic equilibrium is that the total potential $U$ is constant on the surface of the spheroid.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(r'(\\theta), \\theta) = \\text{constant} \\quad (\\text{for all } \\theta) \\label{eq:equipotential} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis implies that the sum of all terms in the expression for $U$ on the surface that depend on the angle $\\theta$ must be zero.\n\n### Step 3: Gravitational Potential on the Surface\nThe external gravitational potential of an axially symmetric body can be described by a multipole expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials. To sufficient accuracy for this problem (order $e^2$), we truncate at the quadrupole term.\n\\[\\boxed{v_g(\\tilde{r}, \\theta) = -\\frac{GM}{\\tilde{r}} + \\frac{G(I_z - I_x)}{\\tilde{r}^3}P_2(\\cos\\theta)}\\]\nwhere $I_z$ and $I_x$ are the principal moments of inertia about the polar (z) and an equatorial (x) axis, respectively. For a uniform oblate spheroid:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_z = \\frac{2}{5}Ma^2, \\quad I_x = \\frac{1}{5}M(a^2+b^2) \\implies I_z - I_x = \\frac{1}{5}M(a^2-b^2) = \\frac{1}{5}Ma^2e^2 \\label{eq:mom_inertia_diff} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe evaluate the potential on the surface $\\tilde{r} = r'(\\theta)$. In the quadrupole term, which is already of order $e^2$, we can approximate $a \\approx R$ and $\\tilde{r} \\approx R$. In the monopole term, we expand $1/r'(\\theta)$ to first order in $e^2$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_g(r'(\\theta), \\theta) &\\approx -\\frac{GM}{R(1 - \\frac{e^2}{3}P_2(\\cos\\theta))} + \\frac{G(\\frac{1}{5}MR^2e^2)}{R^3}P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx -\\frac{GM}{R}\\left(1 + \\frac{e^2}{3}P_2(\\cos\\theta)\\right) + \\frac{GMe^2}{5R}P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{GM}{R} - \\left(\\frac{GMe^2}{3R} - \\frac{GMe^2}{5R}\\right)P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{GM}{R} - \\frac{2}{15}\\frac{GMe^2}{R}P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\label{eq:vg_surface} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe $\\theta$-dependent part of the gravitational potential on the surface is $v_{g,\\theta} = -\\frac{2}{15}\\frac{GMe^2}{R}P_2(\\cos\\theta)$.\n\n### Step 4: Centrifugal Potential on the Surface\nThe centrifugal potential per unit mass for rotation with angular velocity $\\omega$ about the z-axis is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{v_i = -\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2(x^2+y^2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\tilde{r}^2\\sin^2\\theta}\\]\nWe evaluate this potential on the surface $\\tilde{r} = r'(\\theta)$. Since the centrifugal potential is a small perturbation, we can approximate the surface radius by the initial radius, $r'(\\theta) \\approx R$. Any corrections would be of higher order and can be neglected.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_i(r'(\\theta), \\theta) \\approx -\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 R^2 \\sin^2\\theta \\label{eq:vi_approx} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo isolate the angular dependence in the form of $P_2(\\cos\\theta)$, we use the identity $\\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{2}{3}P_2(\\cos\\theta)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_i(r'(\\theta), \\theta) &\\approx -\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 R^2 \\left(\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{2}{3}P_2(\\cos\\theta)\\right) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 R^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 R^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\label{eq:vi_surface} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe $\\theta$-dependent part of the centrifugal potential on the surface is $v_{i,\\theta} = +\\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 R^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta)$.\n\n### Step 5: Tidal Potential on the Surface\nThe gravitational potential per unit mass created by the external ring-shaped Moon can be expressed using a multipole expansion. For a point $(\\tilde{r}, \\theta)$ inside the ring's orbit ($\\tilde{r} \\ll r$), the potential is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{v_t(\\tilde{r}, \\theta) = -\\frac{Gm}{r} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} P_{2l}(0) P_{2l}(\\cos\\theta) \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{r}}{r}\\right)^{2l}}\\]\nWe keep terms up to $l=1$ (the quadrupole term). Using $P_0(x)=1$ and $P_2(x)=\\frac{1}{2}(3x^2-1)$, which gives $P_2(0)=-1/2$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_t(\\tilde{r}, \\theta) &\\approx -\\frac{Gm}{r}\\left[P_0(0)P_0(\\cos\\theta)\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{r}}{r}\\right)^0 + P_2(0)P_2(\\cos\\theta)\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{r}}{r}\\right)^2\\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{Gm}{r}\\left[1 - \\frac{1}{2}P_2(\\cos\\theta)\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{r}}{r}\\right)^2\\right] = -\\frac{Gm}{r} + \\frac{Gm\\tilde{r}^2}{2r^3}P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\label{eq:vt_general} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe evaluate this on the surface $\\tilde{r} = r'(\\theta)$. As with the centrifugal potential, we can approximate $\\tilde{r} \\approx R$ in the small quadrupole term, as corrections are of higher order.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_t(r'(\\theta), \\theta) \\approx -\\frac{Gm}{r} + \\frac{GmR^2}{2r^3}P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\label{eq:vt_surface} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe $\\theta$-dependent part of the tidal potential on the surface is $v_{t,\\theta} = +\\frac{GmR^2}{2r^3}P_2(\\cos\\theta)$.\n\n### Step 6: Applying the Equipotential Condition\nFor the total potential $U$ to be constant on the surface, the sum of all $\\theta$-dependent terms must be zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_{g,\\theta} + v_{i,\\theta} + v_{t,\\theta} &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n-\\frac{2}{15}\\frac{GMe^2}{R}P_2(\\cos\\theta) + \\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 R^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta) + \\frac{GmR^2}{2r^3}P_2(\\cos\\theta) &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(-\\frac{2}{15}\\frac{GMe^2}{R} + \\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 R^2 + \\frac{GmR^2}{2r^3}\\right)P_2(\\cos\\theta) &= 0 \\label{eq:potential_balance} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince this equation must hold for all angles $\\theta$, the coefficient of $P_2(\\cos\\theta)$ must be zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{2}{15}\\frac{GMe^2}{R} &= \\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 R^2 + \\frac{GmR^2}{2r^3} \\nonumber \\\\\ne^2 &= \\frac{15R}{2GM}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 R^2 + \\frac{GmR^2}{2r^3}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\ne^2 &= \\frac{R^3}{GM}\\left(\\frac{15}{2 \\cdot 3}\\omega^2 + \\frac{15}{2 \\cdot 2}\\frac{Gm}{r^3}\\right) = \\frac{R^3}{GM}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\omega^2 + \\frac{15}{4}\\frac{Gm}{r^3}\\right) \\label{eq:e2_intermediate} \\tag{13}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we substitute $M = \\rho \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$, which gives $\\frac{R^3}{GM} = \\frac{R^3}{G(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\rho R^3)} = \\frac{3}{4\\pi G\\rho}$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ne^2 &= \\frac{3}{4\\pi G\\rho}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\omega^2 + \\frac{15}{4}\\frac{Gm}{r^3}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4\\pi G\\rho}\\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\omega^2 + \\frac{45}{4}\\frac{Gm}{r^3}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{16\\pi G\\rho}\\left(30\\omega^2 + 45\\frac{Gm}{r^3}\\right) \\label{eq:e2_final} \\tag{14}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTaking the square root gives the eccentricity $e$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe eccentricity of the Earth when stable is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{e = \\sqrt{\\frac{30\\omega^2 + 45\\frac{Gm}{r^3}}{16\\pi G\\rho}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

We are given the following information:\n*   **Object**: A solid dielectric cylinder.\n*   **Geometric and Physical Properties**:\n    *   Radius: $R$\n    *   Mass: $m$\n    *   Length: $L$\n    *   It is a long cylinder, which implies the approximation $L \\gg R$ can be used to neglect fringe effects at the ends.\n*   **Electromagnetic Properties**:\n    *   The cylinder has a permanent, \"frozen-in\" polarization $\\vec{P}$.\n    *   The polarization vector at a radial distance $r$ from the axis is given by $\\vec{P}(r) = P_0 e^{kr} \\hat{r}$, where $P_0$ and $k$ are constants. The vector is directed radially outward.\n*   **Initial Conditions**: The cylinder is initially at rest, so its initial angular velocity is zero.\n*   **Process**: A constant external torque, with magnitude $M$, is applied to the cylinder, causing it to rotate about its central axis. The angular velocity is $\\vec{\\omega} = \\omega(t) \\hat{z}$, and the angular acceleration is $\\vec{\\beta} = \\beta(t) \\hat{z}$, where $\\beta = d\\omega/dt$.\n*   **Goal**: We need to find the expression for the angular acceleration $\\beta$. The final result should be expressed in terms of the given parameters: $M, m, k, R, L, P_0$, and the permeability of free space, $\\mu_0$.\n\nThe physical process involves a coupling between mechanics and electromagnetism. The applied torque causes rotation. The rotation of the polarized material creates bound electric currents. These currents generate a magnetic field. As the cylinder accelerates, this magnetic field changes in time, which, by Faraday's Law of induction, induces an electric field. This induced electric field exerts a counter-torque (a back-torque) on the polarized material, opposing the acceleration. The net torque determines the final angular acceleration.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Polarization Field and Bound Charges\nFirst, we determine the bound charge distribution arising from the permanent polarization. The term \"permanently polarized\" implies the polarization is \"frozen-in\" the material of the cylinder.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe bound volume charge density $\\rho_b$ and bound surface charge density $\\sigma_b$ are related to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}$ by:\n\\[\\boxed{\\rho_b = -\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{P}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\sigma_b = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n}}\\]\nThe divergence operator in cylindrical coordinates for a radial vector field $\\vec{A} = A_r(r) \\hat{r}$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{A} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r A_r)}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe polarization is given as $\\vec{P}(r) = P_0 e^{kr} \\hat{r}$. This describes a polarization field that is fixed relative to the cylinder's material. Due to the axial symmetry, the polarization field is static in the lab frame, i.e., $\\vec{P}(r, \\phi, z, t) = P_0 e^{kr} \\hat{r}$.\n\nWe calculate the bound volume charge density $\\rho_b$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_b &= -\\nabla \\cdot (P_0 e^{kr} \\hat{r}) = -\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r P_0 e^{kr}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{P_0}{r}(e^{kr} + rke^{kr}) = -P_0 e^{kr} \\left(\\frac{1}{r} + k\\right) \\label{eq:rho_b} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nOn the cylindrical surface at $r=R$, the outward unit normal vector is $\\hat{n} = \\hat{r}$. The bound surface charge density $\\sigma_b$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_b = \\vec{P}(R) \\cdot \\hat{r} = (P_0 e^{kR} \\hat{r}) \\cdot \\hat{r} = P_0 e^{kR} \\label{eq:sigma_b} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Bound Current Calculation\nThe rotation of the cylinder causes the bound charges to move, creating bound currents. The total bound current is the sum of the convection current (from moving charges) and the polarization current (from the time variation of $\\vec{P}$).\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe velocity of a point at position $\\vec{r}$ in a body rotating with angular velocity $\\vec{\\omega}$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{v} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}}\\]\nThe total bound volume current density $\\vec{j}_b$ and surface current density $\\vec{K}_b$ are given by:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{j}_b = \\rho_b \\vec{v} + \\frac{\\partial \\vec{P}}{\\partial t}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{K}_b = \\sigma_b \\vec{v}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nAs established in Step 1, the polarization field $\\vec{P}(r) = P_0 e^{kr} \\hat{r}$ is static in the laboratory frame. Therefore, its partial time derivative is zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial \\vec{P}}{\\partial t} = 0 \\label{eq:dPdt_zero} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis means the polarization current is zero. The bound currents are purely convective.

We use Ampere's law and the corresponding boundary condition to find it. For a long cylinder ($L \\gg R$), we can neglect fringe effects and assume the magnetic field is axial.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nAmpere's law in differential form relates the magnetic field to the current density:\n\\[\\boxed{\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{j}}\\]\nThe boundary condition for the magnetic field at a surface with current $\\vec{K}$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\hat{n} \\times (\\vec{B}_{2} - \\vec{B}_{1}) = \\mu_0 \\vec{K}}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nGiven the cylindrical symmetry and that the currents are purely azimuthal ($\\hat{\\phi}$ direction), the magnetic field inside the long cylinder must be of the form $\\vec{B} = B_z(r) \\hat{z}$. In cylindrical coordinates, the curl of such a field is $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = -\\frac{dB_z}{dr}\\hat{\\phi}$.

To find $C$, we apply the boundary condition at $r=R$. Let region 1 be inside ($r<R$) and region 2 be outside ($r>R$). The normal vector is $\\hat{n}=\\hat{r}$. For a very long cylinder, the external magnetic field is negligible, so we approximate $\\vec{B}_{2}=\\vec{B}_{\\text{out}}=0$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{r} \\times (0 - \\vec{B}_{\\text{in}}(R)) &= \\mu_0 \\vec{K}_b \\nonumber \\\\\n-\\hat{r} \\times (B_z(R)\\hat{z}) &= \\mu_0 (P_0 \\omega R e^{kR} \\hat{\\phi}) \\nonumber \\\\\n-B_z(R) (-\\hat{\\phi}) &= \\mu_0 P_0 \\omega R e^{kR} \\hat{\\phi} \\nonumber \\\\\nB_z(R) &= \\mu_0 P_0 \\omega R e^{kR} \\label{eq:B_boundary} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nComparing this with Eq. \\eqref{eq:B_int} evaluated at $r=R$, we have $B_z(R) = \\mu_0 P_0 \\omega R e^{kR} + C$. This implies that the constant $C=0$.

The compression is caused by slowly adding powder to a thermally insulated piston. A key aspect of this problem is that the effect of gravity on the gas molecules is considered, which results in a non-uniform density and pressure distribution along the height of the cylinder.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   `S`: The cross-sectional area of the cylindrical container.\n*   `p_0`: A parameter with units of pressure, related to the initial mass of the piston, `m_{p,0} = p_0 S / g`.\n*   `p_1`: A parameter with units of pressure, related to the final mass of the piston plus powder, `m_{p,1} = p_1 S / g`.\n*   `g`: The acceleration due to gravity.\n*   `m`: The mass of a single gas molecule.\n*   `N`: The total number of molecules of the gas.\n*   `T_0`: The initial uniform temperature of the gas.\n\nWe make the following assumptions based on the problem description:\n*   The gas is an ideal diatomic gas.\n*   The process is quasi-static (slow) and adiabatic (thermally insulated).\n*   The exterior of the container is a vacuum.\n*   All friction is negligible.\n\nWe define the following variables to describe the state of the system:\n*   `z`: The vertical coordinate, with `z=0` at the bottom of the container.\n*   `H`: The height of the piston from the bottom of the container.\n*   `T`: The uniform temperature of the gas at any instant.\n*   `n(z)`: The number density of gas molecules at height `z`.\n*   `p(z)`: The pressure of the gas at height `z`.\n*   `p`: The pressure exerted by the gas on the piston's lower surface, i.e., `p = p(H)`.\n*   `k`: The Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe goal is to determine the final temperature of the gas, `T_1`, after the compression process is complete.\n\n### Step 1: Equilibrium State and Piston Height\nIn thermal equilibrium at a uniform temperature `T`, the gas molecules are distributed in the gravitational field according to the Boltzmann distribution. We use this, along with the ideal gas law and the mechanical equilibrium of the piston, to relate the piston height `H` to the gas temperature `T` and the pressure `p` at the piston.\n\n\\[\\boxed{n(z) = n(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mgz}{kT}\\right)}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{p(z) = n(z)kT}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{N = \\int_V n(z) dV = \\int_0^H S n(z) dz}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{pS = M_{\\text{total}}g}\\]\n\nHere, `n(0)` is the number density at the bottom of the container (`z=0`), and `M_total` is the total mass of the piston and powder. The pressure at the piston, `p=p(H)`, is determined by the mechanical equilibrium condition.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np(z) &= n(z)kT = \\left(n(0) e^{-mgz/kT}\\right)kT = p(0) e^{-mgz/kT} \\label{eq:pressure_dist} \\\\\np &= p(H) = p(0) e^{-mgH/kT} \\label{eq:piston_pressure}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe total number of molecules `N` is found by integrating the number density over the cylinder's volume:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nN &= \\int_0^H S n(z) dz = S n(0) \\int_0^H e^{-mgz/kT} dz \\\\\n&= S n(0) \\left[-\\frac{kT}{mg} e^{-mgz/kT}\\right]_0^H \\\\\n&= S n(0) \\frac{kT}{mg} \\left(1 - e^{-mgH/kT}\\right) \\label{eq:total_molecules}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom eq. \\eqref{eq:total_molecules}, we have `Nmg = S n(0) kT (1 - e^{-mgH/kT})`. Using `p(0) = n(0) kT` and `p = p(H)` from eq. \\eqref{eq:piston_pressure}, we find `Nmg = S(p(0) - p)`. This gives `p(0) = p + Nmg/S`. Substituting this into eq. \\eqref{eq:piston_pressure}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np &= \\left(p + \\frac{Nmg}{S}\\right) e^{-mgH/kT} \\\\\n\\frac{pS}{pS + Nmg} &= e^{-mgH/kT} \\\\\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{pS + Nmg}{pS}\\right) &= \\frac{mgH}{kT} \\\\\nH &= \\frac{kT}{mg} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{Nmg}{pS}\\right) \\label{eq:height}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis equation relates the state variables `H`, `T`, and `p`.\n\n### Step 2: The First Law of Thermodynamics\nThe process is quasi-static and adiabatic. The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in the total internal energy of the gas, `dU`, equals the work done on the gas, `dW`, as the heat exchange `dQ` is zero. The total internal energy `U` is the sum of the total kinetic energy `E_k` and the total gravitational potential energy `E_p` of the gas molecules.\n\n\\[\\boxed{dU = dQ + dW}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{U = E_k + E_p}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{E_k = \\frac{5}{2}NkT}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{dW = -p dV = -pS dH}\\]\n\nFor an adiabatic process, `dQ=0`. For a diatomic ideal gas, the total kinetic energy is `E_k = (5/2)NkT`. The work done on the gas by the piston is `dW = -pS dH`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ndU &= dE_k + dE_p \\label{eq:dU} \\\\\ndE_k &= \\frac{5}{2}Nk dT \\label{eq:dEk} \\\\\ndU &= 0 + dW = -pS dH \\label{eq:first_law_applied}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nCombining these equations gives the differential form of the energy conservation for this process:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{5}{2}Nk dT + dE_p = -pS dH \\label{eq:first_law_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Gravitational Potential Energy of the Gas\nTo proceed with the first law, we need an expression for the change in the total potential energy of the gas, `dE_p`.

The piston mass is `m_{p,0} = p_0 S/g`. Mechanical equilibrium `p_{gas}(H_0) S = m_{p,0} g` implies the initial gas pressure at the piston is `p=p_0`.

The sphere's rest mass increases as it accretes dust, which in turn affects its trajectory.\n\n*   **Physical System**: A sphere is attached to an ideal spring with a spring constant `k` and a vanishing natural length. The potential energy of the spring is given by `V = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2`, where `x` is the displacement from the origin. Since the motion is a slow spiral, we can use the radial distance `r` for the displacement, so `V = \\frac{1}{2}kr^2`. The force exerted by the spring is a central force, `\\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}} = -k\\vec{r}`.\n*   **Relativistic Motion**: The sphere's speed is potentially comparable to the speed of light, requiring a relativistic treatment. Its momentum is `\\vec{p} = \\gamma m \\vec{v}` and its energy is `E_{\\text{particle}} = \\gamma m c^2`, where `m` is its rest mass and `\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mass Accretion**: The sphere moves through a stationary dust cloud of uniform density `\\rho`. As it moves, it sweeps up dust in a perfectly inelastic collision, causing its rest mass `m(t)` to increase over time. The sphere has a constant cross-sectional area `A`. The collision is described as \"adiabatic,\" which we interpret as a perfectly inelastic collision where the total 4-momentum of the oscillator-dust system is conserved at the instant of collision, with no energy radiated away as heat or sound.\n*   **Initial Conditions**: At time `t=0`, the sphere has an initial rest mass `m_0` and is in a uniform circular motion of radius `R_0`.\n*   **Goal**: We need to find the expression for the time `t` it takes for the radius of the motion to change from its initial value `R_0` to a final value `R`.\n*   **Variables**:\n    *   `m(t)`: The rest mass of the sphere at time `t`.\n    *   `m_0`: The initial rest mass of the sphere at `t=0`.\n    *   `k`: The spring constant.\n    *   `r(t)`: The radius of the path at time `t`.\n    *   `R_0`, `R`: The initial and final radii of the motion.\n    *   `v(t)`: The speed of the sphere at time `t`.\n    *   `\\rho`: The density of the dust.\n    *   `A`: The cross-sectional area of the sphere.\n    *   `c`: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n    *   `t`: The time elapsed.\n*   **Assumptions**:\n    1.  `R^2 \\gg A`: The radius of motion is much larger than the physical size of the sphere, allowing us to treat it as a point mass for trajectory calculations.\n    2.  `m_0 \\gg \\rho A R`: The initial mass of the sphere is much larger than the mass of dust accreted in a typical revolution. This implies that the properties of the motion, such as mass and radius, change very slowly. This justifies treating the motion as a \"quasi-circular orbit\" or a \"slow spiral,\" where the radial velocity `v_r = dr/dt` is much smaller than the tangential velocity `v_\\theta`, and the radial component of momentum change `dp_r/dt` can be neglected.\n\n### Step 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum\nThe equation of motion for a relativistic particle with variable rest mass `m` accreting mass that is initially at rest is given by the relativistic form of Newton's second law. The only external force is the central spring force `\\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}} = -k\\vec{r}`.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}}}\\]\nThe time evolution of the angular momentum `\\vec{L} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}` is determined by the net external torque `\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}}`.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}}}\\]\n**Derivation**\nThe external torque on the sphere is calculated as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}} &= \\vec{r} \\times (-k\\vec{r}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -k (\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{r}) = 0 \\label{eq:torque_zero}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSince the torque is zero, the angular momentum vector `\\vec{L}` is a constant of motion. This confines the motion to a plane perpendicular to the constant vector `\\vec{L}`. We can therefore analyze the motion in terms of its constant magnitude, `L = |\\vec{L}| = L_0`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nL = |\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}| = r p_\\theta = r (\\gamma m v_\\theta) = L_0 = \\text{constant} \\label{eq:L_const} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nHere, `v_\\theta` is the tangential component of the velocity `\\vec{v}`.\n\n### Step 2: Radial Dynamics for Quasi-Circular Motion\nWe analyze the radial component of the relativistic equation of motion. In polar coordinates, the radial component of `d\\vec{p}/dt` is `dp_r/dt - p_\\theta v_\\theta / r`.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{dp_r}{dt} - \\frac{p_\\theta v_\\theta}{r} = F_r}\\]\nThe assumption `m_0 \\gg \\rho A R` implies that the radius `r` changes very slowly. This means the radial velocity `v_r = dr/dt` is very small compared to the tangential velocity `v_\\theta`, and its time derivative (related to radial acceleration) is negligible. This is the quasi-circular approximation.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{dp_r}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\gamma m v_r)}{dt} \\approx 0}\\]\n**Derivation**\nFor our system, `p_r = \\gamma m v_r`, `p_\\theta = \\gamma m v_\\theta`, and the radial force is `F_r = -kr`. The radial equation of motion is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d(\\gamma m v_r)}{dt} - \\frac{\\gamma m v_\\theta^2}{r} = -kr\n\\end{align}\\]\nUnder the quasi-circular approximation, the first term is negligible. We also have that the total speed `v = \\sqrt{v_r^2 + v_\\theta^2} \\approx v_\\theta`. The radial equation simplifies to:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n-\\frac{\\gamma m v^2}{r} &\\approx -kr \\nonumber \\\\\nkr^2 &\\approx \\gamma m v^2 \\label{eq:centripetal} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis equation relates the radius, speed, and the product `\\gamma m` at any point in the slow spiral.\n\n### Step 3: Energy Evolution of the System\nThe system's total energy `E_{\\text{system}}` (particle kinetic energy + potential energy) changes due to the accretion of dust. We derive an expression for the rate of change of this energy.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\n1.  The relativistic equation of motion for a particle with variable rest mass `m(t)` accreting stationary mass:\n    \\[\\boxed{\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}}}\\]\n2.  The total energy of the oscillator-spring system:\n    \\[\\boxed{E_{\\text{system}} = E_{\\text{particle}} + V = \\gamma m c^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kr^2}\\]\n3.  The relationship between a particle's energy, momentum, and rest mass:\n    \\[\\boxed{E_{\\text{particle}}^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}\\]\n4.  The rate of change of potential energy is related to the external force by:\n    \\[\\boxed{\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\nabla V \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} = -\\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}} \\cdot \\vec{v}}\\]\n5.  The rate at which the oscillator sweeps up dust rest mass `dm_{\\text{dust}}` is:\n    \\[\\boxed{\\frac{dm_{\\text{dust}}}{dt} = \\rho A v}\\]\n6.  In a perfectly inelastic collision, the total 4-momentum of the colliding system is conserved. The invariant mass of the system before and after the collision is the same.\n\n**Derivation**\nFirst, we find the rate of change of the particle's energy, `E_{\\text{particle}}`. Differentiating the energy-momentum relation with respect to time:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dt}(E_{\\text{particle}}^2) &= \\frac{d}{dt}((pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2) \\nonumber \\\\\n2E_{\\text{particle}}\\frac{dE_{\\text{particle}}}{dt} &= 2c^2\\left(\\vec{p} \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}\\right) + 2m c^4 \\frac{dm}{dt} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{dE_{\\text{particle}}}{dt} &= \\frac{c^2\\vec{p}}{E_{\\text{particle}}} \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} + \\frac{mc^4}{E_{\\text{particle}}} \\frac{dm}{dt} \\label{eq:dE_dt_general}\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing `\\vec{p} = \\gamma m \\vec{v}` and `E_{\\text{particle}} = \\gamma m c^2`, we get `\\frac{c^2\\vec{p}}{E_{\\text{particle}}} = \\vec{v}` and `\\frac{mc^4}{E_{\\text{particle}}} = \\frac{c^2}{\\gamma}`. Substituting these:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dE_{\\text{particle}}}{dt} = \\vec{v} \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} + \\frac{c^2}{\\gamma}\\frac{dm}{dt} \\label{eq:dE_particle_dt}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe rate of change of the total system energy `E_{system}` is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dE_{\\text{system}}}{dt} &= \\frac{dE_{\\text{particle}}}{dt} + \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\left(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} + \\frac{c^2}{\\gamma}\\frac{dm}{dt}\\right) + (-\\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}} \\cdot \\vec{v}) \\label{eq:dE_sys_intermediate}\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing the equation of motion `d\\vec{p}/dt = \\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}}`, we find:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dE_{\\text{system}}}{dt} &= \\left(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}} + \\frac{c^2}{\\gamma}\\frac{dm}{dt}\\right) - (\\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}} \\cdot \\vec{v}) = \\frac{c^2}{\\gamma}\\frac{dm}{dt} \\label{eq:energy_evo_general}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNext, we determine `dm/dt`. The change in the oscillator's rest mass `dm` results from absorbing a dust particle of rest mass `dm_{dust}`. We use conservation of the system's invariant mass. The 4-momentum of the oscillator is `P_{osc} = (\\gamma m c, \\gamma m \\vec{v})` and for the stationary dust is `P_{dust} = (dm_{dust} c, \\vec{0})`. The invariant mass `M_{sys}` of the combined system is given by `(M_{sys}c)^2 = (P_{osc} + P_{dust})^2`. After the collision, the new particle has rest mass `m' = m+dm`, so `M_{sys} = m'`.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(m+dm)^2 c^2 &= (P_{osc} + P_{dust}) \\cdot (P_{osc} + P_{dust}) = P_{osc}^2 + P_{dust}^2 + 2 P_{osc} \\cdot P_{dust} \\nonumber \\\\\n(m+dm)^2 c^2 &= (mc)^2 + (dm_{dust}c)^2 + 2(\\gamma m c)(dm_{dust}c) \\nonumber \\\\\nm^2+2m\\,dm + (dm)^2 &= m^2 + (dm_{dust})^2 + 2\\gamma m\\,dm_{dust} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nIgnoring infinitesimal terms of second order (`(dm)^2`, `(dm_{dust})^2`):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n2m\\,dm &\\approx 2\\gamma m\\,dm_{dust} \\nonumber \\\\\ndm &= \\gamma\\,dm_{dust} \\label{eq:mass_increase}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe rate of change of rest mass is thus `dm/dt = \\gamma (dm_{dust}/dt) = \\gamma \\rho A v`. Substituting this into Eq. \\eqref{eq:energy_evo_general}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dE_{\\text{system}}}{dt} &= \\frac{c^2}{\\gamma} (\\gamma \\rho A v) = \\rho A v c^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\gamma m c^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kr^2 \\right) &= \\rho A v c^2 \\label{eq:energy_evo_final} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 4: Deriving the Differential Equation for the Radius\nWe now combine the conserved angular momentum `L_0` and the dynamical equations to find a differential equation for the radius `r`.\n\\[\\boxed{L_0 = r(\\gamma m v) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad kr^2 = \\gamma m v^2}\\]\n**Derivation**\nFrom the two equations above (using Eq. \\eqref{eq:L_const} with `v_\\theta \\approx v` and Eq. \\eqref{eq:centripetal}), we can express `v` and `\\gamma m` in terms of `r` and constants.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nL_0 &= r(\\gamma m v) \\label{eq:L_def_re} \\\\\nkr^2 &= (\\gamma m) v^2 \\label{eq:kr2_gammamv_re}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFrom Eq. \\eqref{eq:kr2_gammamv_re}, we express `\\gamma m` as `kr^2/v^2`. Substituting this into Eq. \\eqref{eq:L_def_re}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nL_0 = r \\left(\\frac{kr^2}{v^2}\\right) v = \\frac{kr^3}{v} \\implies v = \\frac{kr^3}{L_0} \\label{eq:v_of_r} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow we express the product `\\gamma m` in terms of `r` using Eq. \\eqref{eq:L_def_re} and Eq. \\eqref{eq:v_of_r}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\gamma m = \\frac{L_0}{rv} = \\frac{L_0}{r(kr^3/L_0)} = \\frac{L_0^2}{kr^4} \\label{eq:gammam_of_r} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstitute these expressions for `v` and `\\gamma m` into the energy evolution equation (Eq. \\eqref{eq:energy_evo_final}):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{L_0^2}{kr^4} c^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kr^2 \\right) &= \\rho A \\left(\\frac{kr^3}{L_0}\\right) c^2 \\label{eq:pre_diff}\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing the chain rule on the left side, `\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{dr}{dt}\\frac{d}{dr}`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{L_0^2 c^2}{k}r^{-4} + \\frac{k}{2}r^2 \\right) \\frac{dr}{dt} &= \\frac{\\rho A k c^2 r^3}{L_0} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left( \\frac{L_0^2 c^2}{k}(-4r^{-5}) + kr \\right) \\frac{dr}{dt} &= \\frac{\\rho A k c^2 r^3}{L_0} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left( kr - \\frac{4L_0^2 c^2}{kr^5} \\right) \\frac{dr}{dt} &= \\frac{\\rho A k c^2 r^3}{L_0} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nIsolating `dt` gives the differential element of time as a function of the change in radius `dr`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ndt &= \\frac{kr - \\frac{4L_0^2 c^2}{kr^5}}{\\frac{\\rho A k c^2 r^3}{L_0}} dr = \\frac{L_0}{\\rho A k c^2 r^3} \\left( kr - \\frac{4L_0^2 c^2}{kr^5} \\right) dr \\nonumber \\\\\ndt &= \\frac{1}{\\rho A} \\left( \\frac{L_0}{c^2 r^2} - \\frac{4L_0^3}{k^2 r^8} \\right) dr \\label{eq:dt_dr} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 5: Integration to Find the Elapsed Time\nTo find the total time `t` for the radius to change from `R_0` to `R`, we integrate Eq. \\eqref{eq:dt_dr}. First, we determine the sign of `dr`.\n\\[\\boxed{t = \\int_0^t dt' = \\int_{R_0}^R \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\rho A} \\left( \\frac{L_0}{c^2 r^2} - \\frac{4L_0^3}{k^2 r^8} \\right) \\right] dr}\\]\n**Derivation**\nThe differential time `dt` must be positive. Let's analyze the sign of the right-hand side of Eq. \\eqref{eq:dt_dr}. The term in the parenthesis can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\frac{L_0}{c^2 r^2} - \\frac{4L_0^3}{k^2 r^8} = \\frac{L_0}{c^2 r^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{4L_0^2 c^2}{k^2 r^6} \\right) \\]\nUsing `v = kr^3/L_0` from Eq. \\eqref{eq:v_of_r}, we have `L_0^2 = k^2 r^6 / v^2`. Substituting this into the parenthesis gives:\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{4(k^2 r^6 / v^2) c^2}{k^2 r^6} = 1 - \\frac{4c^2}{v^2} \\]\nSince the particle is relativistic and has mass, its speed `v` must be less than the speed of light `c`. Thus, `v^2 < c^2`, which implies `c^2/v^2 > 1`, and `4c^2/v^2 > 4`. Therefore, the term `(1 - 4c^2/v^2)` is negative.\nThe entire coefficient of `dr` in Eq. \\eqref{eq:dt_dr} is negative. Since `dt` must be positive, `dr` must be negative (`dt = (\\text{negative}) \\times dr \\implies dr < 0`). This means the radius of the motion decreases over time. The integration will be from the initial radius `R_0` to a smaller final radius `R`.\n\nPerforming the integration:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nt &= \\frac{1}{\\rho A} \\int_{R_0}^R \\left( \\frac{L_0}{c^2} r^{-2} - \\frac{4L_0^3}{k^2} r^{-8} \\right) dr \\nonumber \\\\\nt &= \\frac{1}{\\rho A} \\left[ \\frac{L_0}{c^2} \\frac{r^{-1}}{-1} - \\frac{4L_0^3}{k^2} \\frac{r^{-7}}{-7} \\right]_{R_0}^R \\nonumber \\\\\nt &= \\frac{1}{\\rho A} \\left[ -\\frac{L_0}{c^2 r} + \\frac{4L_0^3}{7k^2 r^7} \\right]_{R_0}^R \\nonumber \\\\\nt &= \\frac{1}{\\rho A} \\left[ \\left(-\\frac{L_0}{c^2 R} + \\frac{4L_0^3}{7k^2 R^7}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{L_0}{c^2 R_0} + \\frac{4L_0^3}{7k^2 R_0^7}\\right) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\nt &= \\frac{1}{\\rho A} \\left[ \\frac{L_0}{c^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_0} - \\frac{1}{R}\\right) + \\frac{4L_0^3}{7k^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{R^7} - \\frac{1}{R_0^7}\\right) \\right] \\label{eq:time_integrated}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFactoring out `L_0` and rearranging terms gives the final expression for the time `t`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nt = \\frac{L_0}{\\rho A} \\left[ \\frac{4L_0^2}{7k^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{R^7} - \\frac{1}{R_0^7}\\right) - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{R_0}\\right) \\right] \\label{eq:time_final} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 6: Determining the Constant of Motion `L_0`\nThe constant `L_0` is determined by the initial conditions at `t=0`, where `r=R_0`, `m=m_0`, and the speed is `v_0`. The Lorentz factor is `\\gamma_0 = (1-v_0^2/c^2)^{-1/2}`.\n\\[\\boxed{L_0 = R_0 \\gamma_0 m_0 v_0}\\]\nFrom the radial dynamics equation, Eq. \\eqref{eq:centripetal}, applied at `t=0`: `kR_0^2 = \\gamma_0 m_0 v_0^2`. We can find an expression for `L_0^2`:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nL_0^2 &= (R_0 \\gamma_0 m_0 v_0)^2 = R_0^2 (\\gamma_0 m_0)^2 v_0^2 = R_0^2 (\\gamma_0 m_0) (\\gamma_0 m_0 v_0^2) \\nonumber \\\\\nL_0^2 &= R_0^2 (\\gamma_0 m_0) (kR_0^2) = \\gamma_0 m_0 k R_0^4 \\label{eq:L0_squared} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo find `\\gamma_0`, we eliminate `v_0` using the definition of the Lorentz factor and the centripetal force equation.\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\]\n**Derivation**\nSubstituting `v^2 = kr^2/(\\gamma m)` from Eq. \\eqref{eq:centripetal}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} &= 1 - \\frac{kr^2}{\\gamma m c^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n1 &= \\gamma^2 - \\frac{kr^2}{mc^2}\\gamma \\nonumber \\\\\n\\gamma^2 - \\left(\\frac{kr^2}{mc^2}\\right)\\gamma - 1 &= 0 \\label{eq:gamma_quad}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation for `\\gamma`. We solve it for the initial conditions (`r=R_0, m=m_0`) to find `\\gamma_0`. Since `\\gamma_0 \\ge 1`, we must take the positive root of the quadratic formula:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\gamma_0 &= \\frac{ \\left(\\frac{kR_0^2}{m_0c^2}\\right) + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{kR_0^2}{m_0c^2}\\right)^2 - 4(1)(-1)} }{2(1)} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\gamma_0 &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{kR_0^2}{m_0c^2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{kR_0^2}{m_0c^2}\\right)^2 + 4} \\right) \\label{eq:gamma0} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe constant of motion `L_0` is now fully determined by the initial parameters of the problem via Eq. \\eqref{eq:L0_squared} and Eq. \\eqref{eq:gamma0}.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe time `t` required for the circular motion radius to change from `R_0` to `R` (where `R < R_0`) is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{t = \\frac{L_0}{\\rho A} \\left[ \\frac{4L_0^2}{7k^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{R^7} - \\frac{1}{R_0^7}\\right) - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{R_0}\\right) \\right]}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere the constant of motion `L_0` is determined by the initial conditions via `L_0^2 = \\gamma_0 m_0 k R_0^4`, and the initial Lorentz factor `\\gamma_0` is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\gamma_0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{kR_0^2}{m_0c^2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{kR_0^2}{m_0c^2}\\right)^2 + 4} \\right)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The working substance is an ideal gas with a fixed adiabatic index $\\gamma = C_p/C_V$. The engine operates on a rectangular thermodynamic cycle on a pressure-volume ($p-V$) diagram.\n\nThe cycle consists of four processes connecting four states. Let the pressures be $p_1$ and $p_2$ and the volumes be $V_1$ and $V_2$, with $p_1 < p_2$ and $V_1 < V_2$. The four corner states of the rectangular cycle are:\n-   State A: $(V_1, p_1)$\n-   State B: $(V_1, p_2)$\n-   State C: $(V_2, p_2)$\n-   State D: $(V_2, p_1)$\n\nThe cycle is positive (clockwise), meaning net work is done by the gas. The processes are:\n1.  A $\\to$ B: Isochoric heating (constant volume $V_1$).\n2.  B $\\to$ C: Isobaric expansion (constant pressure $p_2$).\n3.  C $\\to$ D: Isochoric cooling (constant volume $V_2$).\n4.  D $\\to$ A: Isobaric compression (constant pressure $p_1$).\n\nThe following constraints are given:\n1.  **Net Work**: The net work done per cycle, $W$, is the area of the rectangle on the $p-V$ diagram. It is a fixed positive value. We define $\\Delta p = p_2 - p_1$ and $\\Delta V = V_2 - V_1$. Then, $W = \\Delta p \\Delta V$.\n2.  **Containment Constraint**: The rectangular cycle must contain a specific point $(p_0, V_0)$. This implies the following inequalities must hold: $p_1 \\le p_0 \\le p_2$ and $V_1 \\le V_0 \\le V_2$.\n3.  **Physicality Assumption**: The work $W$ is stated to be \"sufficiently small\". This ensures that for the optimal cycle, the pressure and volume remain positive, i.e., $p_1 > 0$ and $V_1 > 0$.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum possible efficiency, $\\eta_{max}$, by choosing the optimal cycle parameters ($p_1, p_2, V_1, V_2$) that satisfy these constraints.\n\n### Step 1: General Expression for Cycle Efficiency\nThe efficiency of any heat engine is defined as the ratio of the net work done by the engine, $W_{net}$, to the total heat absorbed from the hot reservoir, $Q_{in}$.\n\\[\\boxed{\\eta = \\frac{W_{net}}{Q_{in}}}\\]\n**Derivation:**\nFor this cycle, the net work done is the area of the rectangle, which is given as a fixed value $W$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nW_{net} = W\n\\label{eq:work} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo maximize the efficiency $\\eta$ for a fixed work output $W$, we must minimize the total heat absorbed, $Q_{in}$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\eta = \\frac{W}{Q_{in}} \\implies \\eta_{max} = \\frac{W}{Q_{in, min}}\n\\label{eq:eta_max_general} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Heat Absorbed ($Q_{in}$)\nHeat is absorbed by the ideal gas when its temperature increases. According to the ideal gas law, $T \\propto pV$. Temperature increases during the isochoric heating process (A $\\to$ B, where pressure increases at constant volume) and the isobaric expansion process (B $\\to$ C, where volume increases at constant pressure).\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe heat transfer and internal energy change are governed by the following principles for an ideal gas:\n\\[\\boxed{Q = \\Delta U + W_{by} \\quad (\\text{First Law of Thermodynamics})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\Delta U = n C_V \\Delta T \\quad (\\text{Internal energy of an ideal gas})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{pV = nRT \\quad (\\text{Ideal Gas Law})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{C_p - C_V = R \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\gamma = C_p/C_V \\quad (\\text{Properties of an ideal gas})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{W_{by} = \\int p \\, dV \\quad (\\text{Work done by the gas})}\\]\n**Derivation:**\nFirst, we derive a more convenient expression for the change in internal energy. From the ideal gas relations, we find $C_V = R/(\\gamma-1)$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\Delta U = n C_V \\Delta T = n \\left(\\frac{R}{\\gamma-1}\\right) \\Delta T = \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1} \\Delta(nRT) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}\\Delta(pV)\n\\label{eq:delta_U_pV} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we calculate the heat absorbed in the two relevant processes:\n\n1.  **Isochoric heating (A $\\to$ B)**: Volume is constant at $V_1$, so $dV=0$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nW_{by, A \\to B} &= 0 \\\\\nQ_1 = Q_{A \\to B} &= \\Delta U_{A \\to B} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}(p_2V_1 - p_1V_1) = \\frac{V_1(p_2-p_1)}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{V_1 \\Delta p}{\\gamma-1}\n\\label{eq:Q1} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n2.  **Isobaric expansion (B $\\to$ C)**: Pressure is constant at $p_2$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nW_{by, B \\to C} &= \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} p_2 \\, dV = p_2(V_2-V_1) = p_2 \\Delta V \\\\\n\\Delta U_{B \\to C} &= \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}(p_2V_2 - p_2V_1) = \\frac{p_2(V_2-V_1)}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{p_2 \\Delta V}{\\gamma-1} \\\\\nQ_2 = Q_{B \\to C} &= \\Delta U_{B \\to C} + W_{by, B \\to C} = \\frac{p_2 \\Delta V}{\\gamma-1} + p_2 \\Delta V = \\frac{\\gamma p_2 \\Delta V}{\\gamma-1}\n\\label{eq:Q2} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe total heat absorbed, $Q_{in}$, is the sum of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, as both are positive (since $p_2>p_1$ and $V_2>V_1$).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nQ_{in} = Q_1 + Q_2 = \\frac{V_1 \\Delta p}{\\gamma-1} + \\frac{\\gamma p_2 \\Delta V}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}(V_1 \\Delta p + \\gamma p_2 \\Delta V)\n\\label{eq:Qin_total} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Optimizing the Cycle's Position\nTo minimize $Q_{in}$, we must minimize the function $f(p_1, p_2, V_1, V_2) = V_1 \\Delta p + \\gamma p_2 \\Delta V$ subject to the given constraints. We perform this minimization in two sequential steps.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe optimization is subject to the constraints:\n\\[\\boxed{(p_2-p_1)(V_2-V_1) = W}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{p_1 \\le p_0 \\le p_2}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{V_1 \\le V_0 \\le V_2}\\]\n**Derivation:**\n**Part A: Optimizing volume placement for fixed pressures.**\nLet's fix the pressures $p_1$ and $p_2$. This fixes $\\Delta p = p_2-p_1$ and consequently $\\Delta V = W/\\Delta p$. We want to minimize $Q_{in}$, which is proportional to $f(V_1) = V_1 \\Delta p + \\gamma p_2 \\Delta V$. Since the second term is constant for fixed pressures, we only need to minimize $V_1 \\Delta p$. As $\\Delta p > 0$, this is equivalent to minimizing $V_1$.\nThe constraints on $V_1$ are $V_1 \\le V_0$ and $V_2 \\ge V_0$. Since $V_2 = V_1 + \\Delta V$, the second constraint becomes $V_1 + \\Delta V \\ge V_0$, which implies $V_1 \\ge V_0 - \\Delta V$.\nThus, the allowed range for $V_1$ is $[V_0 - \\Delta V, V_0]$. The minimum value is $V_1 = V_0 - \\Delta V$. This choice sets $V_2 = V_1 + \\Delta V = V_0$.\nThis means that for any given pressure range, the heat input is minimized when the right side of the rectangle passes through $V_0$.\n\n**Part B: Optimizing pressure placement.**\nBased on Part A, the optimal configuration must have $V_2 = V_0$. Now we optimize the pressure placement. Let's fix the shape of the rectangle, i.e., fix $\\Delta p$ and $\\Delta V$. We want to find the optimal values of $p_1$ and $p_2$. With $V_2=V_0$ and $V_1=V_0-\\Delta V$, the function to minimize is $Q_{in} \\propto V_1 \\Delta p + \\gamma p_2 \\Delta V = (V_0-\\Delta V)\\Delta p + \\gamma p_2 \\Delta V = V_0\\Delta p - W + \\gamma p_2 \\Delta V$.\nLet's consider this as a function of $p_2$: $g(p_2) = (V_0\\Delta p - W) + (\\gamma \\Delta V) p_2$. Since $\\gamma > 0$ and $\\Delta V > 0$, the slope with respect to $p_2$ is positive. Thus, $g(p_2)$ is minimized by choosing the smallest possible value for $p_2$.\nThe constraints on $p_2$ are $p_2 \\ge p_0$ and $p_1 \\le p_0$. The second constraint is $p_2 - \\Delta p \\le p_0$, or $p_2 \\le p_0 + \\Delta p$.\nThe allowed range for $p_2$ is $[p_0, p_0 + \\Delta p]$.

The magnitudes of these velocities are $v_1 = |\\mathbf{v}_1|$ and $v_2 = |\\mathbf{v}_2|$, and the angle between their directions is an acute angle $\\alpha$. The crucial condition is that the speeds of the two spacecraft relative to the medium are equal. We must consider relativistic effects, and the speed of light is $c$.\n\nWe define the following frames of reference and variables:\n*   $S$: The primary inertial frame of reference, where the velocities $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ are measured.\n*   $S'$: The rest frame of the space medium.

We need to relate the Lorentz factors of the spacecraft in frame $S'$ ($\\gamma'_1, \\gamma'_2$) to the known quantities in frame $S$. This can be achieved using the Lorentz-invariant scalar product of 4-velocities.\n\n\\[\\boxed{U = \\gamma(v)(c, \\mathbf{v})}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{A \\cdot B = A_0 B_0 - \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\gamma'_p = \\frac{U_p \\cdot U_f}{c^2}}\\]\n\nThe Lorentz factor $\\gamma'_p$ of a particle (4-velocity $U_p$) as measured in a frame $F$ (4-velocity $U_f$) is given by the Lorentz-invariant scalar product $\\gamma'_p = (U_p \\cdot U_f) / c^2$.

This condition allows us to establish a constraint on the medium's velocity $\\mathbf{u}$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{|\\mathbf{v}'_1| = |\\mathbf{v}'_2|}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\gamma(v) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}}\\]\n\nThe Lorentz factor $\\gamma(v)$ is a monotonically increasing function of speed $v$ for $v \\in [0, c)$, since its derivative $d\\gamma/dv = (v/c^2)(1-v^2/c^2)^{-3/2}$ is positive. Therefore, the condition $|\\mathbf{v}'_1| = |\\mathbf{v}'_2|$ is equivalent to the condition that their corresponding Lorentz factors in frame $S'$ are equal, i.e., $\\gamma'_1 = \\gamma'_2$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\gamma'_1 &= \\gamma'_2 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\gamma_1 \\gamma_u \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{u}}{c^2}\\right) &= \\gamma_2 \\gamma_u \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{u}}{c^2}\\right) \\quad (\\text{using eqs. \\ref{eq:gamma_trans1}, \\ref{eq:gamma_trans2}}) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\gamma_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{u}}{c^2}\\right) &= \\gamma_2 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{u}}{c^2}\\right) \\quad (\\text{since } u < c, \\gamma_u \\neq 0) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\gamma_1 - \\frac{\\gamma_1}{c^2}(\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) &= \\gamma_2 - \\frac{\\gamma_2}{c^2}(\\mathbf{v}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2 &= \\frac{1}{c^2} (\\gamma_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{u} - \\gamma_2 \\mathbf{v}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\nonumber \\\\\nc^2(\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2) &= \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\gamma_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 - \\gamma_2 \\mathbf{v}_2) \\label{eq:u_condition} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Minimizing the Speed of the Medium u\nEquation \\eqref{eq:u_condition} is a linear equation for the unknown velocity $\\mathbf{u}$.

Equation \\eqref{eq:u_condition} becomes $c^2(\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2) = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{K}$.\nLet $u = |\\mathbf{u}|$ and let $\\theta$ be the angle between the vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{K}$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nc^2(\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2) &= u |\\mathbf{K}| \\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\nu &= \\frac{c^2(\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2)}{|\\mathbf{K}| \\cos\\theta} \\label{eq:u_magnitude} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe are looking for the minimum positive value of $u$. The value of $u$ depends on the angle $\\theta$. To minimize $u$, we must maximize the magnitude of the denominator, $|\\mathbf{K}| |\\cos\\theta|$. Since $|\\mathbf{K}|$ is a fixed value determined by the given parameters, we must maximize $|\\cos\\theta|$. The maximum value of $|\\cos\\theta|$ is 1, which occurs when $\\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = \\pi$. This means that for the minimum speed $u$, the velocity vector $\\mathbf{u}$ must be collinear with the vector $\\mathbf{K}$.\nThe minimum speed $u_{min}$ is therefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nu_{min} = \\left| \\frac{c^2(\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2)}{|\\mathbf{K}|} \\right| = \\frac{c^2|\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2|}{|\\mathbf{K}|} = \\frac{c^2|\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2|}{|\\gamma_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 - \\gamma_2 \\mathbf{v}_2|} \\label{eq:u_min_intermediate} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Final Expression for u_min\nTo obtain the final expression for $u_{min}$, we calculate the magnitude of the vector $\\mathbf{K} = \\gamma_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 - \\gamma_2 \\mathbf{v}_2$ and substitute it into Equation \\eqref{eq:u_min_intermediate}.\n\n\\[\\boxed{|\\mathbf{A}|^2 = \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2 = v_1 v_2 \\cos\\alpha}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\gamma^2(v) v^2 = c^2(\\gamma^2(v) - 1)}\\]\n\nWe compute the square of the magnitude, $|\\mathbf{K}|^2$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|\\mathbf{K}|^2 &= (\\gamma_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 - \\gamma_2 \\mathbf{v}_2) \\cdot (\\gamma_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 - \\gamma_2 \\mathbf{v}_2) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\gamma_1^2 |\\mathbf{v}_1|^2 + \\gamma_2^2 |\\mathbf{v}_2|^2 - 2\\gamma_1\\gamma_2(\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\gamma_1^2 v_1^2 + \\gamma_2^2 v_2^2 - 2\\gamma_1\\gamma_2 v_1 v_2 \\cos\\alpha \\nonumber \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing the identity $\\gamma^2(v) v^2 = c^2(\\gamma^2(v) - 1)$, we can rewrite the first two terms to simplify the expression:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|\\mathbf{K}|^2 &= c^2(\\gamma_1^2 - 1) + c^2(\\gamma_2^2 - 1) - 2\\gamma_1\\gamma_2 v_1 v_2 \\cos\\alpha \\nonumber \\\\\n&= c^2(\\gamma_1^2 + \\gamma_2^2 - 2) - 2\\gamma_1\\gamma_2 v_1 v_2 \\cos\\alpha \\label{eq:K_squared_final} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we substitute this into the expression for $u_{min}$ from Equation \\eqref{eq:u_min_intermediate}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nu_{min} &= \\frac{c^2|\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2|}{|\\mathbf{K}|} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{c^2|\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2|}{\\sqrt{c^2(\\gamma_1^2 + \\gamma_2^2 - 2) - 2\\gamma_1\\gamma_2 v_1 v_2 \\cos\\alpha}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{c|\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2|}{\\sqrt{\\gamma_1^2 + \\gamma_2^2 - 2 - \\frac{2}{c^2}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2 v_1 v_2 \\cos\\alpha}} \\label{eq:final_u_min} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis expression gives the minimum speed $u_{min}$ in terms of the Lorentz factors $\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2$ and the given speeds and angle.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimum possible value of the speed $u$ of the medium is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nu_{min} = \\frac{c|\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2|}{\\sqrt{\\gamma_1^2 + \\gamma_2^2 - 2 - \\frac{2}{c^2}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2 v_1 v_2 \\cos\\alpha}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_1^2/c^2}}$ and $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_2^2/c^2}}$."}

The electric field from the uniformly charged inner shell is calculated using the shell theorem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Forces and Conserved Quantities\nFirst, we determine the force acting on the sphere and identify the conserved quantities governing its motion.\n\n*   **Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n    The electric field $\\vec{E}$ produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell of charge $Q$ and radius $R_{shell}$ at a distance $r$ from its center is given by the shell theorem:\n    \\[\\boxed{\n    \\vec{E} = \n    \\begin{cases} \n    \\frac{kQ}{r^2}\\hat{r} & \\text{for } r > R_{shell} \\\\\n    0 & \\text{for } r < R_{shell} \n    \\end{cases}\n    }\\]\n    The electric force $\\vec{F}$ on a charge $q$ in an electric field $\\vec{E}$ is:\n    \\[\\boxed{\\vec{F} = q\\vec{E}}\\]\n    For a central force (a force always directed towards or away from a fixed center), the angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ about that center is conserved.\n    \\[\\boxed{\\vec{L} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p} = \\text{constant}}\\]\n    For a conservative force, the total mechanical energy $E$ is conserved. The potential energy $U$ is related to the force by $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$.\n    \\[\\boxed{E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + U(r) = \\text{constant}}\\]\n\n*   **Derivation**:\n    The uncharged outer shell ($r=2R$) produces no electric field. The inner shell (radius $R$, charge $Q$) produces an electric field in the region of motion ($R \\le r \\le 2R$). According to the shell theorem, for $r \\ge R$, the field is:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\vec{E}(r) = \\frac{kQ}{r^2}\\hat{r}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    The force on the sphere with charge $q$ is therefore:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\vec{F}(r) = q\\vec{E}(r) = \\frac{kQq}{r^2}\\hat{r} \\label{eq:force} \\tag{1}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    Since $Q>0$ and $q>0$, the force is repulsive. This force is a central force, as it always points radially away from the center $O$. Consequently, the angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ of the sphere about $O$ is conserved.\n    The force is also conservative, as it depends only on the radial distance $r$. The associated electrostatic potential energy $U(r)$ is:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    U(r) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\vec{F}(r') \\cdot d\\vec{r'} = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\frac{kQq}{r'^2} dr' = \\left[\\frac{kQq}{r'}\\right]_{\\infty}^{r} = \\frac{kQq}{r}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    Thus, the total mechanical energy $E$ of the sphere is also conserved:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{kQq}{r} = \\text{constant} \\label{eq:energy} \\tag{2}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: The Equation of the Trajectory\nThe trajectory of a particle under an inverse-square central force is a conic section.\n\n*   **Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n    For a particle moving under a repulsive inverse-square central force $F = K/r^2$ (with $K=kQq>0$), the trajectory is a hyperbola. The general polar equation of this hyperbola, with the force center at the external focus, is:\n    \\[\\boxed{r(\\phi) = \\frac{p}{e\\cos(\\phi - \\phi_0) - 1}}\\]\n    where $p$ is the semi-latus rectum, $e > 1$ is the eccentricity, and $\\phi_0$ is the angle of the axis of symmetry. The parameters $p$ and $e$ are related to the energy $E$ and angular momentum magnitude $L$ by:\n    \\[\\boxed{p = \\frac{L^2}{mK} = \\frac{L^2}{mkQq}}\\]\n    \\[\\boxed{e = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2EL^2}{mK^2}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2EL^2}{m(kQq)^2}}}\\]\n\n*   **Derivation**:\n    The motion of the sphere between any two collisions is governed by the repulsive inverse-square force given by Eq. \\eqref{eq:force}. Since the total energy $E = K+U$ must be positive ($K \\ge 0$ and $U=kQq/r > 0$), the eccentricity $e$ is always greater than 1. Therefore, the path of the sphere between collisions is a segment of a hyperbola, with the center of the shells $O$ being the repulsive focus.\n\n### Step 3: Geometric Analysis of the Periodic Orbit\nWe analyze the geometry of the complete orbit to relate it to the number of collisions $n$.\n\n*   **Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n    In a perfectly elastic collision with a fixed, massive, spherical surface that is concentric with the center of force, the impulse delivered to the particle is purely radial.\n    \\[\\boxed{\\text{Tangential velocity is unchanged, radial velocity reverses sign: } (v_t, v_r) \\to (v_t, -v_r)}\\]\n\n*   **Derivation**:\n    The problem states that the sphere returns to its starting point $A$ after a total angular displacement of $2\\pi$ and after $n$ collisions with the inner shell. Let the points of collision with the inner shell be $A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_{n-1}$, where $A_0=A$ is the launch point and the final return is to $A_n=A_0$.\n    The path from any collision point $A_i$ to the next $A_{i+1}$ forms one segment of the total orbit. Due to the rotational symmetry of the system, all $n$ segments must be identical. Therefore, the angular displacement for each segment is the same: $\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{segment}} = 2\\pi/n$.\n    Each of these segments consists of an outward path (from the inner shell at $A_i$ to the outer shell at some point $B_i$) and an inward path (from $B_i$ back to the inner shell at $A_{i+1}$).\n    The collision at the outer shell at point $B_i$ is elastic. Because the shell is spherical and centered at $O$, the collision reverses the radial component of the sphere's velocity while leaving the tangential component unchanged. This means the subsequent trajectory ($B_i \\to A_{i+1}$) is a mirror image of the preceding trajectory ($A_i \\to B_i$) with respect to the line $OB_i$.\n    Consequently, the angular displacement of the outward path, $\\Delta\\phi(A_i \\to B_i)$, is equal to the angular displacement of the inward path, $\\Delta\\phi(B_i \\to A_{i+1})$. Let's denote this angle by $\\alpha$.\n    The total angular displacement for one full segment is the sum of these two: $\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{segment}} = \\alpha + \\alpha = 2\\alpha$.\n    By combining our findings, we get $2\\alpha = 2\\pi/n$, which simplifies to:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\label{eq:angle} \\tag{3}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    This is the angle subtended at the center $O$ by the hyperbolic arc connecting a point on the inner shell to a point on the outer shell.\n\n### Step 4: Condition for Minimum Launch Speed\nTo find the minimum launch speed, we must find the trajectory that requires the minimum total energy.\n\n*   **Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n    The total energy is related to the launch speed $v$ at the inner shell ($r=R$) by:\n    \\[\\boxed{E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{kQq}{R}}\\]\n    For a transfer orbit between two radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ over a fixed angle $\\Delta\\phi < \\pi$, the trajectory with the minimum possible total energy $E$ is the one that is tangential to the circular path at either $r_1$ or $r_2$.\n\n*   **Derivation**:\n    From the energy equation, minimizing the launch speed $v$ at a fixed radius $R$ is equivalent to minimizing the total mechanical energy $E$ of the sphere.\n    The trajectory segment connects the inner shell ($r=R$) to the outer shell ($r=2R$) over an angle $\\alpha = \\pi/n$. For a physically meaningful orbit with at least one bounce on the outer shell, we must have $n \\ge 2$, which implies $\\alpha \\le \\pi/2$. This satisfies the condition $\\alpha < \\pi$ for the minimum energy principle.\n    This principle states that the orbit with the lowest energy will have a velocity that is purely tangential at one of the endpoints ($r=R$ or $r=2R$). A point where the velocity is purely tangential is an apsis (a turning point in radial motion). For a repulsive central force, the only possible apsis is the pericenter (point of closest approach).\n    Since the motion occurs for $r \\ge R$, the pericenter distance $r_p$ must be $r_p \\le R$. For the trajectory to have an apsis at either $R$ or $2R$, it must be the pericenter, which must be at the smaller radius, $R$.\n    Therefore, the minimum energy trajectory occurs when the pericenter distance is $r_p=R$. This means the sphere is launched tangentially from the inner shell.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating Trajectory Parameters for the Minimum Speed Case\nWe now use the condition for minimum speed to determine the specific parameters of the hyperbolic trajectory.\n\n*   **Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n    The equation for a hyperbolic orbit with its pericenter (point of closest approach) oriented at angle $\\phi=0$ is:\n    \\[\\boxed{r(\\phi) = \\frac{p}{e\\cos\\phi - 1}}\\]\n\n*   **Derivation**:\n    We set up a polar coordinate system where the launch point $A$ (the pericenter) is at $\\phi=0$.\n    At point $A$: $r=R$ at $\\phi=0$. Substituting into the orbit equation:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    R = \\frac{p}{e\\cos(0) - 1} = \\frac{p}{e-1} \\label{eq:cond1} \\tag{4}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    The sphere then travels to a point $B$ on the outer shell, where $r=2R$, after an angular displacement of $\\alpha = \\pi/n$.\n    At point $B$: $r=2R$ at $\\phi=\\alpha$.\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    2R = \\frac{p}{e\\cos\\alpha - 1} \\label{eq:cond2} \\tag{5}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    We solve the system of equations \\eqref{eq:cond1} and \\eqref{eq:cond2} for $e$. From \\eqref{eq:cond1}, $p = R(e-1)$. Substituting this into \\eqref{eq:cond2}:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    2R &= \\frac{R(e-1)}{e\\cos\\alpha - 1} \\\\\n    2(e\\cos\\alpha - 1) &= e-1 \\\\\n    2e\\cos\\alpha - 2 &= e - 1 \\\\\n    e(2\\cos\\alpha - 1) &= 1 \\\\\n    e &= \\frac{1}{2\\cos\\alpha - 1} \\label{eq:eccentricity} \\tag{6}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    For the trajectory to be a hyperbola, the eccentricity must be $e > 1$. This requires the denominator to be positive and less than 1: $0 < 2\\cos\\alpha - 1 < 1$.\n    The condition $2\\cos\\alpha - 1 > 0$ implies $\\cos\\alpha > 1/2$. Substituting $\\alpha = \\pi/n$, we get $\\cos(\\pi/n) > 1/2$. Since $\\cos(x)$ is a decreasing function for $x \\in [0, \\pi]$, this means $\\pi/n < \\pi/3$, which gives $n > 3$.\n    Thus, a periodic orbit of the type described is only possible for an integer $n > 3$. For $n=3$, $e$ would be infinite, requiring infinite launch speed. For $n<3$, a tangential launch from $r=R$ cannot connect to $r=2R$ over the angle $\\pi/n$. The problem statement implies such an orbit exists, so we proceed assuming $n$ is an integer greater than 3.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Minimum Launch Speed\nFinally, we relate the trajectory parameters back to the energy and solve for the speed $v$.\n\n*   **Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n    The energy of a hyperbolic orbit under a repulsive force $kQq/r^2$ is related to its semi-major axis $a$:\n    \\[\\boxed{E = \\frac{kQq}{2a}}\\]\n    The semi-major axis $a$, semi-latus rectum $p$, and eccentricity $e$ are related by:\n    \\[\\boxed{p = a(e^2-1)}\\]\n    The energy is related to the launch speed by the conservation of energy equation:\n    \\[\\boxed{E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{kQq}{R}}\\]\n\n*   **Derivation**:\n    First, we find the semi-major axis $a$. From Eq. \\eqref{eq:cond1}, $p=R(e-1)$.\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    a = \\frac{p}{e^2-1} = \\frac{R(e-1)}{(e-1)(e+1)} = \\frac{R}{e+1}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    Substituting the expression for $e$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:eccentricity} with $\\alpha=\\pi/n$:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    a = \\frac{R}{\\frac{1}{2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1} + 1} = \\frac{R}{\\frac{1 + (2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1)}{2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1}} = \\frac{R(2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1)}{2\\cos(\\pi/n)} \\label{eq:semiaxis} \\tag{7}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    Now, we calculate the total energy $E$:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    E = \\frac{kQq}{2a} = \\frac{kQq}{2R \\frac{2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1}{2\\cos(\\pi/n)}} = \\frac{kQq}{R} \\frac{\\cos(\\pi/n)}{2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1} \\label{eq:final_energy} \\tag{8}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    Using the conservation of energy at the launch point, we find the kinetic energy and then the speed $v$:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 &= E - \\frac{kQq}{R} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{kQq}{R} \\frac{\\cos(\\pi/n)}{2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1} - \\frac{kQq}{R} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{kQq}{R} \\left( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi/n) - (2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1)}{2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1} \\right) \\\\\n    &= \\frac{kQq}{R} \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\pi/n)}{2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1} \\label{eq:kinetic_energy} \\tag{9}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n    Solving for the minimum launch speed $v$:\n    \\[\\begin{align}\n    v^2 &= \\frac{2kQq}{mR} \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\pi/n)}{2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1} \\\\\n    v &= \\sqrt{\\frac{2kQq}{mR} \\frac{1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}{2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) - 1}} \\label{eq:final_speed} \\tag{10}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimum launch speed $v$ required for the described periodic motion is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2kQq}{mR} \\frac{1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}{2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) - 1}}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis solution is valid for integers $n>3$, as this condition is required for the existence of a real, hyperbolic trajectory that satisfies the problem's geometric constraints under the minimum energy condition."}

The system consists of an adiabatic cylinder with a uniform cross-sectional area $S$. A thin, lightweight, adiabatic, and movable piston divides the cylinder into two chambers.\n\n**Initial State (t=0):**\n*   The piston is at the center, dividing the cylinder into two equal volumes, $V_0$.\n*   **Left Chamber (Part 1):** Contains an ideal gas with initial pressure $p_{1,i} = 2p_0$ and initial volume $V_{1,i} = V_0$.\n*   **Right Chamber (Part 2):** Contains the same type of ideal gas with initial pressure $p_{2,i} = p_0$ and initial volume $V_{2,i} = V_0$.\n*   The ideal gas in both chambers has a constant adiabatic index $\\gamma = 5/3$.\n\n**Process:**\n*   The piston is released from rest. Due to the pressure difference, it moves to the right.\n*   The motion is slow, implying the process is quasistatic. This means the gas in each chamber remains in internal thermodynamic equilibrium at all times.\n*   A viscous material provides a frictional force that opposes the piston's motion, generating heat.\n*   The total heat generated by friction, $dQ_{gen}$, is distributed equally between the two chambers. The heat absorbed by the left chamber is $dQ_1$ and by the right is $dQ_2$, with $dQ_1 = dQ_2 = \\frac{1}{2} dQ_{gen}$.\n*   The cylinder walls and the piston are adiabatic, preventing any other heat exchange with the surroundings.\n\n**Final State:**\n*   The piston eventually comes to rest. At this point, the forces on it are balanced, which means the pressures in the two chambers are equal. Let this final pressure be $p_f$.\n*   The piston will have moved a distance $l$ to the right. The final volumes will be $V_{1,f} = V_0 + Sl$ and $V_{2,f} = V_0 - Sl$.\n\n**Goal:**\nThe objective is to calculate the displacement $l$ of the piston. The result must be expressed in the form $l = x \\frac{V_0}{S}$, where $x$ is a numerical coefficient determined to two significant figures.\n\n### Step 1: Energy Conservation for the Combined System\nWe begin by applying the First Law of Thermodynamics to each chamber to find a conservation law for the entire system.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system undergoing a quasistatic process is:\n\\[\\boxed{\ndU = dQ - p\\,dV\n}\\]\nThe internal energy of an ideal gas with a constant adiabatic index $\\gamma$ is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{\nU = \\frac{pV}{\\gamma-1}\n}\\]\nThe net work done by the gases on the piston over an infinitesimal displacement is converted into heat by the viscous friction.\n\\[\\boxed{\ndQ_{gen} = (p_1 - p_2)dV_1\n}\\]\nThe problem states that this generated heat is distributed equally to both chambers:\n\\[\\boxed{\ndQ_1 = dQ_2 = \\frac{1}{2} dQ_{gen}\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nFor this problem, the adiabatic index is $\\gamma = 5/3$, so the internal energy of the gas is $U = \\frac{pV}{5/3 - 1} = \\frac{3}{2}pV$. Let's consider an infinitesimal displacement of the piston to the right, causing the volume of the left chamber to increase by $dV_1$ and the right chamber to decrease by $dV_2 = -dV_1$.\n\nFor the left chamber (Part 1), the change in internal energy is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ndU_1 &= dQ_1 - p_1 dV_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} dQ_{gen} - p_1 dV_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(p_1 - p_2)dV_1 - p_1 dV_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{1}{2}p_1 - \\frac{1}{2}p_2 - p_1\\right)dV_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2}(p_1 + p_2)dV_1 \\label{eq:dU1} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFor the right chamber (Part 2), the change in internal energy is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ndU_2 &= dQ_2 - p_2 dV_2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} dQ_{gen} - p_2(-dV_1) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(p_1 - p_2)dV_1 + p_2 dV_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{1}{2}p_1 - \\frac{1}{2}p_2 + p_2\\right)dV_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(p_1 + p_2)dV_1 \\label{eq:dU2} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe total change in internal energy of the system (the gas in both chambers) is the sum of the changes for each part:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ndU_{total} = dU_1 + dU_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}(p_1 + p_2)dV_1 + \\frac{1}{2}(p_1 + p_2)dV_1 = 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis result shows that the total internal energy of the system is conserved throughout the process. We can therefore equate the initial and final total internal energies.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nU_{total, initial} &= U_{1,i} + U_{2,i} = \\frac{3}{2}p_{1,i}V_{1,i} + \\frac{3}{2}p_{2,i}V_{2,i} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{2}(2p_0)V_0 + \\frac{3}{2}(p_0)V_0 = \\frac{9}{2}p_0V_0 \\label{eq:U_initial} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSince $U_{total}$ is constant, for any state during the process:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nU_1 + U_2 = \\frac{3}{2}(p_1V_1 + p_2V_2) = \\frac{9}{2}p_0V_0\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis gives us a crucial energy conservation constraint that holds at all times:\n\\[\\begin{align}\np_1V_1 + p_2V_2 = 3p_0V_0 \\label{eq:energy_conservation} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the Differential Equation for the Process\nWe now use the results from Step 1 to formulate a differential equation that describes the state of the gas in the left chamber as the piston moves.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nWe use the following relationships derived or defined previously:\n\\[\\boxed{\ndU_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}(p_1 + p_2)dV_1\n}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\nU_1 = \\frac{3}{2}p_1V_1\n}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\np_2 = \\frac{3p_0V_0 - p_1V_1}{V_2}\n}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\nV_1 + V_2 = 2V_0\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nBy differentiating the expression for $U_1$ and equating it to the expression for $dU_1$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nd\\left(\\frac{3}{2}p_1V_1\\right) &= -\\frac{1}{2}(p_1 + p_2)dV_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{3}{2}(V_1 dp_1 + p_1 dV_1) &= -\\frac{1}{2}(p_1 + p_2)dV_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n3V_1 dp_1 + 3p_1 dV_1 &= -p_1 dV_1 - p_2 dV_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n3V_1 dp_1 + (4p_1 + p_2) dV_1 &= 0 \\label{eq:pre_de} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nWe eliminate $p_2$ and $V_2$ using the constraints: $p_2 = (3p_0V_0 - p_1V_1)/(2V_0 - V_1)$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n3V_1 dp_1 + \\left(4p_1 + \\frac{3p_0V_0 - p_1V_1}{2V_0 - V_1}\\right) dV_1 = 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo simplify, we introduce a dimensionless displacement variable $x = \\frac{Sl}{V_0}$, where $l$ is the piston's displacement to the right. The volumes and their differentials become:\n$V_1 = V_0 + Sl = V_0(1+x)$, $V_2 = V_0 - Sl = V_0(1-x)$, and $dV_1 = S\\,dl = V_0\\,dx$.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n3V_0(1+x) dp_1 + \\left(4p_1 + \\frac{3p_0V_0 - p_1V_0(1+x)}{V_0(1-x)}\\right) V_0 dx = 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nDividing by $V_0$ and grouping terms with $dx$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n3(1+x) dp_1 + \\left[4p_1 + \\frac{3p_0 - p_1(1+x)}{1-x}\\right] dx = 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo clear the denominator, we multiply the entire equation by $(1-x)$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n3(1+x)(1-x) dp_1 + \\left[4p_1(1-x) + 3p_0 - p_1(1+x)\\right] dx &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n3(1-x^2) dp_1 + [4p_1 - 4p_1x + 3p_0 - p_1 - p_1x] dx &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n3(1-x^2) \\frac{dp_1}{dx} + p_1(3 - 5x) + 3p_0 &= 0 \\label{eq:final_de} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Ordinary Differential Equation\nThe relation derived in Step 2 is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $p_1(x)$. We solve it using the method of integrating factors.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nA first-order linear ODE in the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)$ can be solved using an integrating factor $I(x)$:\n\\[\\boxed{\nI(x) = \\exp\\left(\\int P(x) dx\\right)\n}\\]\nThe solution is then found from the equation $\\frac{d}{dx}(I(x)y) = I(x)Q(x)$.\n\n**Derivation**:\nFirst, we rewrite Eq. \\eqref{eq:final_de} in the standard form $\\frac{dp_1}{dx} + P(x)p_1 = Q(x)$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dp_1}{dx} + p_1 \\left(\\frac{3-5x}{3(1-x^2)}\\right) = -\\frac{3p_0}{3(1-x^2)} = -\\frac{p_0}{1-x^2} \\label{eq:standard_de} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe function $P(x)$ is $P(x) = \\frac{3-5x}{3(1-x^2)}$. We integrate $P(x)$ using partial fraction decomposition:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(x) = \\frac{3-5x}{3(1-x)(1+x)} = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{A}{1-x} + \\frac{B}{1+x}\\right)\n\\end{align}\\]\nMultiplying by $3(1-x)(1+x)$ gives $3-5x = A(1+x) + B(1-x)$.\n*   For $x=1$: $3-5 = A(2) \\implies -2 = 2A \\implies A = -1$.\n*   For $x=-1$: $3-5(-1) = B(2) \\implies 8 = 2B \\implies B = 4$.\nSo, $P(x) = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{4}{1+x} - \\frac{1}{1-x}\\right)$. The integral is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\int P(x) dx = \\frac{1}{3} \\int \\left(\\frac{4}{1+x} - \\frac{1}{1-x}\\right) dx = \\frac{4}{3}\\ln(1+x) + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln(1-x) = \\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\left((1+x)^4(1-x)\\right)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe integrating factor $I(x)$ is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nI(x) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\left((1+x)^4(1-x)\\right)\\right) = (1+x)^{4/3}(1-x)^{1/3} \\label{eq:integrating_factor} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\\]\nMultiplying Eq. \\eqref{eq:standard_de} by $I(x)$ yields:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[p_1(x) (1+x)^{4/3}(1-x)^{1/3}\\right] &= Q(x)I(x) = -\\frac{p_0}{1-x^2} (1+x)^{4/3}(1-x)^{1/3} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -p_0 (1-x)^{-1}(1+x)^{-1} (1+x)^{4/3}(1-x)^{1/3} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -p_0 (1+x)^{1/3}(1-x)^{-2/3} \\label{eq:integrable_de} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 4: Applying Boundary Conditions to Find the Displacement\nWe integrate the differential relation from the initial state to the final state to find the total displacement.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nWe apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to the result of Step 3.\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\int_a^b F'(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n}\\]\n**Boundary Conditions**:\n*   Initial state (dimensionless displacement $x=0$): The pressure in the left chamber is given.\n\\[\\boxed{p_1(0) = 2p_0}\\]\n*   Final state (dimensionless displacement $x=y=Sl/V_0$): The piston stops, so pressures equalize. The final pressure $p_f$ is determined by energy conservation.\n\\[\\boxed{p_1(y) = p_f = \\frac{3}{2}p_0}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe final pressure $p_f$ is found from the energy conservation law, Eq. \\eqref{eq:energy_conservation}, applied to the final state where $p_1=p_2=p_f$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\np_f V_{1,f} + p_f V_{2,f} = 3p_0V_0 \\implies p_f(V_{1,f} + V_{2,f}) = 3p_0V_0\n\\end{align}\\]\nSince the total volume is constant, $V_{1,f} + V_{2,f} = 2V_0$, we get $p_f(2V_0) = 3p_0V_0$, which gives $p_f = \\frac{3}{2}p_0$.\n\nNow, we integrate Eq. \\eqref{eq:integrable_de} from the initial displacement $x=0$ to the final displacement $x=y$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^y \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[p_1(x) (1+x)^{4/3}(1-x)^{1/3}\\right] dx = \\int_0^y -p_0 (1+x)^{1/3}(1-x)^{-2/3} dx\n\\end{align}\\]\nApplying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to the left side:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left[p_1(x) (1+x)^{4/3}(1-x)^{1/3}\\right]_0^y = -p_0 \\int_0^y (1+x)^{1/3}(1-x)^{-2/3} dx\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting the boundary conditions for pressure, $p_1(y) = \\frac{3}{2}p_0$ and $p_1(0) = 2p_0$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{3}{2}p_0 (1+y)^{4/3}(1-y)^{1/3}\\right) - \\left(2p_0 (1+0)^{4/3}(1-0)^{1/3}\\right) = -p_0 \\int_0^y (1+x)^{1/3}(1-x)^{-2/3} dx\n\\end{align}\\]\nDividing by $p_0$ and rearranging gives the final equation for $y$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n2 - \\frac{3}{2}(1+y)^{4/3}(1-y)^{1/3} = \\int_0^y \\left(\\frac{1+x}{(1-x)^2}\\right)^{1/3} dx \\label{eq:final_integral_eq} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 5: Numerical Solution\nThe final integral equation, Eq. \\eqref{eq:final_integral_eq}, is a transcendental equation for the dimensionless displacement $y$.

The metal is modeled as a collection of free electrons and fixed positive ions, subjected to a uniform, oscillating external electric field $\\vec{E}(t) = \\vec{E}_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n\nThe key physical quantities and constants are:\n*   **External Electric Field**: $\\vec{E}(t) = \\vec{E}_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $\\vec{E}_0$ is the constant amplitude vector and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n*   **Electron Properties**:\n    *   Effective mass: $m$.\n    *   Charge: $-e$.\n    *   Number density (number of free electrons per unit volume): $n$.\n*   **Electromagnetic Properties of the Medium**:\n    *   Permittivity of free space: $\\varepsilon_0$.\n    *   Polarization intensity (electric dipole moment per unit volume): $\\vec{P}$.\n    *   Electric displacement: $\\vec{D}$.\n    *   AC dielectric constant: $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between these quantities is given by the constitutive relation: $\\vec{D} = \\varepsilon \\vec{E} = \\varepsilon_0 \\vec{E} + \\vec{P}$. This implies that $\\varepsilon \\vec{E} = \\varepsilon_0 \\vec{E} + \\vec{P}$. The term $\\varepsilon$ in this context represents the absolute permittivity. However, the \"dielectric constant\" often refers to the dimensionless relative permittivity, $\\varepsilon_r = \\varepsilon / \\varepsilon_0$. We will derive this standard quantity, $\\varepsilon_r(\\omega)$, and following common convention, denote it as $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$.\n\nThe main assumptions of the model are:\n1.  The positive ions are massive and considered fixed.\n2.  The free electrons are treated as a sparse gas, meaning electron-electron interactions are ignored.\n3.  The electric field acting on each electron is the external applied field $\\vec{E}(t)$.\n4.  All dissipative forces (e.g., due to collisions) are negligible.\n\nTo simplify the analysis of the oscillatory system, we will use complex notation. The physical electric field $\\vec{E}(t) = \\vec{E}_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$ can be represented as the imaginary part of a complex phasor: $\\vec{E}(t) = \\text{Im}[\\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t)]$, where $\\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t) = \\vec{E}_0 e^{i\\omega t}$. We will solve the problem using these complex quantities, as all governing equations are linear.\n\n### Step 1: Equation of Motion for a Free Electron\nWe apply Newton's second law to a single free electron.

Using the electron's charge $q=-e$ and its acceleration $\\vec{a} = d^2\\vec{r}/dt^2$, we write the equation of motion for the complex displacement phasor $\\tilde{\\vec{r}}(t)$ driven by the complex electric field $\\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm \\frac{d^2\\tilde{\\vec{r}}(t)}{dt^2} = -e \\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t) \\label{eq:eom_complex} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the complex form of the electric field, $\\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t) = \\vec{E}_0 e^{i\\omega t}$, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm \\frac{d^2\\tilde{\\vec{r}}(t)}{dt^2} = -e \\vec{E}_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\label{eq:eom_specific} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for the Steady-State Electron Displacement\nWe seek the steady-state oscillatory solution for the electron's displacement, which will have the same frequency as the driving field. We propose a solution of the form:\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Ansatz for steady-state solution: } \\tilde{\\vec{r}}(t) = \\vec{r}_0 e^{i\\omega t}}\\]\nwhere $\\vec{r}_0$ is the complex amplitude of the displacement.\n\nTo substitute this ansatz into the equation of motion (eq. \\ref{eq:eom_specific}), we first need its second time derivative.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d\\tilde{\\vec{r}}(t)}{dt} &= \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\vec{r}_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\right) = i\\omega \\vec{r}_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\label{eq:velocity} \\tag{3} \\\\\n\\frac{d^2\\tilde{\\vec{r}}(t)}{dt^2} &= \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( i\\omega \\vec{r}_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\right) = (i\\omega)^2 \\vec{r}_0 e^{i\\omega t} = -\\omega^2 \\vec{r}_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\label{eq:acceleration} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we substitute this expression for the acceleration into the equation of motion (eq. \\ref{eq:eom_specific}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm(-\\omega^2 \\vec{r}_0 e^{i\\omega t}) &= -e \\vec{E}_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\label{eq:eom_substituted} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe term $e^{i\\omega t}$ is non-zero and can be cancelled from both sides, leaving an equation for the amplitude $\\vec{r}_0$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n-m\\omega^2 \\vec{r}_0 &= -e \\vec{E}_0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\vec{r}_0 &= \\frac{e\\vec{E}_0}{m\\omega^2} \\label{eq:r0_solution} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, the complex displacement vector is related to the complex electric field vector by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{\\vec{r}}(t) = \\vec{r}_0 e^{i\\omega t} = \\left(\\frac{e\\vec{E}_0}{m\\omega^2}\\right) e^{i\\omega t} = \\frac{e}{m\\omega^2} \\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t) \\label{eq:r_vs_E} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Polarization and Electric Susceptibility\nThe displacement of electrons creates a net electric dipole moment per unit volume, which is the polarization intensity $\\vec{P}$.\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Dipole moment of one electron-ion pair: } \\tilde{\\vec{p}}(t) = -e\\tilde{\\vec{r}}(t)}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Polarization Intensity: } \\tilde{\\vec{P}}(t) = n \\tilde{\\vec{p}}(t)}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Electric Susceptibility Definition: } \\tilde{\\vec{P}}(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\chi_e(\\omega) \\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t)}\\]\nFirst, we find the complex polarization $\\tilde{\\vec{P}}(t)$ by combining the first two principles and using the result from Step 2 (eq. \\ref{eq:r_vs_E}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{\\vec{P}}(t) = n(-e\\tilde{\\vec{r}}(t)) = -ne \\left( \\frac{e}{m\\omega^2} \\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t) \\right) = -\\frac{ne^2}{m\\omega^2} \\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t) \\label{eq:polarization} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we compare this result with the definition of the electric susceptibility, $\\chi_e(\\omega)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\varepsilon_0 \\chi_e(\\omega) \\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t) &= -\\frac{ne^2}{m\\omega^2} \\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t) \\label{eq:compare_P} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBy cancelling $\\tilde{\\vec{E}}(t)$, we find the expression for the electric susceptibility:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\chi_e(\\omega) = -\\frac{ne^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m\\omega^2} \\label{eq:susceptibility} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the AC Dielectric Constant\nThe relative dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_r(\\omega)$ is related to the electric susceptibility $\\chi_e(\\omega)$.

The plasma consists of protons and electrons and is in thermal equilibrium at a temperature \\( T \\). A point charge \\( q \\) is introduced, creating a spherically symmetric electrostatic potential \\( \\varphi(r) \\). This potential perturbs the charge distribution, leading to a screening effect.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, variables, and assumptions:\n1.  **Physical System**: A plasma composed of protons (charge \\(+e\\)) and electrons (charge \\(-e\\)).\n2.  **Variables and Constants**:\n    *   \\( n_0 \\): The equilibrium number density of both protons and electrons far from the point charge.\n    *   \\( q \\): The magnitude of the point charge introduced into the plasma.\n    *   \\( \\varphi(r) \\): The electrostatic potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the charge \\( q \\).\n    *   \\( \\rho(r) \\): The net charge density at a distance \\( r \\).\n    *   \\( e \\): The elementary charge.\n    *   \\( k \\): The Boltzmann constant.\n    *   \\( T \\): The absolute temperature of the plasma.\n    *   \\( \\varepsilon_0 \\): The vacuum permittivity.\n    *   \\( \\lambda_D \\): The Debye radius, the quantity to be derived.\n3.  **Governing Equation**: The electrostatic potential is governed by Poisson's equation, which in spherical coordinates is given as:\n    \\[ \\nabla^2 \\varphi = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\varphi}{\\mathrm{d}r} \\right) = -\\frac{\\rho(r)}{\\varepsilon_0} \\]\n4.  **Assumptions and Conditions**:\n    *   The number densities of protons (\\(n_p\\)) and electrons (\\(n_e\\)) follow the Boltzmann distribution.\n    *   The plasma is electrically neutral far from the point charge \\( q \\). This implies the boundary condition \\( \\varphi(r) \\to 0 \\) as \\( r \\to \\infty \\).\n    *   The potential energy of the charges is much smaller than their thermal energy, leading to the weak potential approximation: \\( |e\\varphi| \\ll kT \\).\n5.  **Hint**: A trial solution of the form \\( \\varphi(r) = \\frac{u(r)}{r} \\) can simplify the Laplacian operator in Poisson's equation.\n6.  **Definition**: The Debye radius \\( \\lambda_D \\) is physically described as the distance at which the potential decays to \\( \\frac{1}{e} \\) of the vacuum point charge potential.\n\nThe goal is to derive the mathematical expression for \\( \\lambda_D \\) using these principles.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Net Charge Density from Boltzmann Statistics\nFirst, we express the number densities of protons and electrons as a function of the electrostatic potential \\( \\varphi \\). The Boltzmann distribution gives the number density of a species in thermal equilibrium.\n\\[\\boxed{ n = C e^{-U/kT} }\\]\nHere, \\( U \\) is the potential energy of a particle and \\( C \\) is a normalization constant. The potential energy of a charge \\( q' \\) in an electrostatic potential \\( \\varphi \\) is:\n\\[\\boxed{ U = q' \\varphi }\\]\nFor protons (charge \\(+e\\)) and electrons (charge \\(-e\\)), the potential energies are \\( U_p = +e\\varphi \\) and \\( U_e = -e\\varphi \\), respectively. The constant \\( C \\) is determined by the boundary condition at \\( r \\to \\infty \\), where \\( \\varphi \\to 0 \\) and the densities of both species are \\( n_0 \\).

This condition allows us to linearize the exponential terms using a first-order Taylor expansion.\n\\[\\boxed{ e^x \\approx 1 + x \\quad \\text{for } |x| \\ll 1 }\\]\nLet \\( x = \\frac{e\\varphi}{kT} \\). The assumption \\( |e\\varphi| \\ll kT \\) implies \\( |x| \\ll 1 \\). The expansions are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ne^{-e\\varphi/kT} &\\approx 1 - \\frac{e\\varphi}{kT} \\label{eq:taylor_minus} \\tag{4} \\\\\ne^{+e\\varphi/kT} &\\approx 1 + \\frac{e\\varphi}{kT} \\label{eq:taylor_plus} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting these approximations into the charge density equation (\\ref{eq:rho_exact}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho(\\varphi) &\\approx e n_0 \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{e\\varphi}{kT}\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{e\\varphi}{kT}\\right) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= e n_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{e\\varphi}{kT} - 1 - \\frac{e\\varphi}{kT} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= e n_0 \\left( -\\frac{2e\\varphi}{kT} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{2n_0 e^2}{kT} \\varphi \\label{eq:rho_linear} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis linearized relation shows that the net charge density induced by the potential is directly proportional to the potential itself.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Screened Poisson Equation\nNext, we substitute the linearized expression for the charge density \\( \\rho(\\varphi) \\) into Poisson's equation.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\nabla^2 \\varphi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0} }\\]\nUsing the result from equation (\\ref{eq:rho_linear}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\nabla^2 \\varphi &= -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0} \\left( -\\frac{2n_0 e^2}{kT} \\varphi \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\nabla^2 \\varphi &= \\left( \\frac{2n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 kT} \\right) \\varphi \\label{eq:screened_poisson} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation, also known as the screened Poisson equation. It describes how the electrostatic potential behaves in a medium that screens the charge.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Screened Poisson Equation to Find the Potential's Form\nTo understand the physical meaning of the constant term in equation (\\ref{eq:screened_poisson}) and to verify the screening behavior, we solve this differential equation. We define a characteristic length \\( \\lambda_D \\) such that the equation takes a standard form.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} \\equiv \\frac{2n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 kT} }\\]\nThe differential equation becomes \\( \\nabla^2 \\varphi = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} \\varphi \\). We solve this using the hint and boundary conditions.\n\\[\\boxed{ \\nabla^2 \\varphi = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d\\varphi}{dr} \\right) }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\varphi(r) = \\frac{u(r)}{r} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{Boundary Condition: } \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\varphi(r) = 0 }\\]\nFirst, we apply the substitution \\( \\varphi(r) = u(r)/r \\) to the Laplacian operator:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\nabla^2 \\varphi = \\nabla^2 \\left(\\frac{u}{r}\\right) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d}{dr} \\left(\\frac{u}{r}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\left(\\frac{u'}{r} - \\frac{u}{r^2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r u' - u \\right) = \\frac{1}{r^2} (u' + ru'' - u') = \\frac{u''}{r} \\label{eq:laplacian_u} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the screened Poisson equation \\( \\nabla^2 \\varphi = \\varphi / \\lambda_D^2 \\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{u''}{r} &= \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} \\frac{u}{r} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} u &= 0 \\label{eq:ode_u} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is a standard second-order homogeneous linear ODE. Its general solution is \\( u(r) = C_1 e^{-r/\\lambda_D} + C_2 e^{r/\\lambda_D} \\). The potential is then \\( \\varphi(r) = \\frac{1}{r} (C_1 e^{-r/\\lambda_D} + C_2 e^{r/\\lambda_D}) \\). Applying the boundary condition that \\( \\varphi(r) \\to 0 \\) as \\( r \\to \\infty \\) requires \\( C_2 = 0 \\), since the \\( e^{r/\\lambda_D} \\) term would otherwise diverge. The physical solution is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\varphi(r) = \\frac{C_1}{r} e^{-r/\\lambda_D} \\label{eq:debye_potential} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis result, the Debye-Hückel potential, shows that the potential is a Coulomb-like potential (\\( \\propto 1/r \\)) multiplied by an exponential decay factor. The characteristic length of this decay is \\( \\lambda_D \\), confirming its role as the screening length.\n\n### Step 5: Derive the Expression for the Debye Radius\nIn Step 4, we defined the Debye radius \\( \\lambda_D \\) in terms of the physical constants of the plasma. We now write down this relationship and solve for \\( \\lambda_D \\).\n\\[\\boxed{ \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} = \\frac{2n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 kT} }\\]\nBy taking the reciprocal of both sides, we obtain an expression for \\( \\lambda_D^2 \\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lambda_D^2 &= \\frac{\\varepsilon_0 kT}{2n_0 e^2} \\label{eq:lambda_sq} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the final expression for the Debye radius.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lambda_D &= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 kT}{2n_0 e^2}} \\label{eq:lambda_D_final} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe derived expression for the Debye radius \\( \\lambda_D \\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 kT}{2n_0 e^2}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

Three spheres (let's call them A, B, and C) are placed on a smooth horizontal surface, arranged symmetrically such that they are in contact with each other. A rope is wrapped around the equators of these three spheres. A fourth sphere (O) is placed on top, resting in the hollow formed by the three bottom spheres. The system is held together by the tension in the rope. We are asked to find this tension.\n\nThe given information is:\n*   There are four identical, homogeneous spheres.\n*   The weight of each sphere is $P$.\n*   The horizontal surface is smooth, implying it is frictionless.\n*   The system is in static equilibrium.\n\nLet's define the variables and geometric points:\n*   $P$: The weight of each sphere.\n*   $R$: The radius of each sphere.\n*   $T$: The tension in the rope.\n*   A, B, C: The centers of the three spheres on the horizontal plane.

The system is in static equilibrium, so the net force on each sphere is zero.\n2.  The rope is inextensible and massless. It is wrapped horizontally at the height of the centers of the bottom spheres.\n3.  The three bottom spheres are identical and arranged symmetrically. Thus, the forces they exert on the top sphere are identical in magnitude, and the forces exerted on them by the top sphere are also identical.\n4.  The rope provides the necessary inward force to counteract the outward push from the top sphere. This implies that the normal forces between the bottom spheres themselves (e.g., between sphere A and sphere B) are zero. The tension in the rope is precisely what is needed to maintain the configuration.\n\nThe goal is to find the tension $T$ in terms of the given weight $P$.\n\n### Step 1: Geometric Analysis of the Sphere Arrangement\nTo analyze the forces, we first need to determine the geometry of the sphere configuration. Specifically, we need the angle between the line connecting the center of the top sphere to a bottom sphere and the vertical axis. The centers of the three bottom spheres (A, B, C) form an equilateral triangle on the horizontal plane. The center of the top sphere (O) is located directly above the centroid (G) of this triangle.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Distance between centers of two touching spheres} = 2R}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{For an equilateral triangle with side length } a \\text{, the distance from a vertex to the centroid is } d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Definition of sine: } \\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Definition of cosine: } \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}}\n\\]\nThe derivation of the key angle is as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{The centers A, B, C form an equilateral triangle with side length } a = 2R, \\text{ as the spheres are touching.} \\label{eq:side_length} \\\\\n& \\text{The distance from any vertex (e.g., C) to the centroid G is given by the formula for an equilateral triangle:} \\nonumber \\\\\n& CG = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2R}{\\sqrt{3}}. \\label{eq:centroid_dist} \\\\\n& \\text{The top sphere O touches the bottom sphere C, so the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii:} \\nonumber \\\\\n& OC = R + R = 2R. \\label{eq:center_dist} \\\\\n& \\text{The line segment OG is vertical, and CG is horizontal.

The vector sum of all forces acting on this sphere must be zero.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sum \\vec{F} = 0}\n\\]\nThe forces acting on the top sphere are its weight $\\vec{P}$ (acting vertically downwards through O) and the three normal forces from the bottom spheres, $\\vec{N}_{A}$, $\\vec{N}_{B}$, and $\\vec{N}_{C}$. By symmetry, the magnitudes of these normal forces are equal, i.e., $|\\vec{N}_{A}| = |\\vec{N}_{B}| = |\\vec{N}_{C}| = N$. Each normal force acts along the line connecting the centers of the respective spheres (e.g., along CO for sphere C).\n\nWe consider the equilibrium of forces in the vertical direction. The horizontal components of the three normal forces cancel each other out due to the symmetric arrangement.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum F_{\\text{vertical}} &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n& \\text{The vertical component of each normal force is directed upwards and has magnitude } N_{\\text{vertical}} = N \\cos\\theta. \\nonumber \\\\\n& \\text{The total upward force from the three normal forces must balance the downward weight P.} \\nonumber \\\\\n3 (N \\cos\\theta) - P &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\nN &= \\frac{P}{3\\cos\\theta}. \\label{eq:normal_force}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Force Equilibrium of a Bottom Sphere\nNext, we analyze the forces acting on one of the bottom spheres, for example, the sphere with center C. We consider the equilibrium of forces in the horizontal plane.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sum \\vec{F} = 0}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Newton's Third Law: } \\vec{F}_{12} = -\\vec{F}_{21}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Resultant of two equal forces: For two forces of magnitude } F \\text{ with an angle } \\phi \\text{ between them, the magnitude of their resultant is } R = 2F \\cos(\\phi/2).}\n\\]\nThe horizontal forces acting on sphere C are:\n1.  The horizontal component of the reaction force from the top sphere O. By Newton's third law, the force exerted by sphere O on sphere C is equal and opposite to the force exerted by C on O. This reaction force has magnitude $N$ and is directed from O to C. Its horizontal component, $N_h$, acts radially outwards from the center of the system (along the line GC).\n2.  The tension forces from the rope. The rope segments connecting to spheres A and B pull on sphere C. Each force has magnitude $T$.

The ring has a mass $m$, radius $r$, and self-inductance $L$. The pendulum is pivoted at one end of the string.\n\nThe physical process unfolds as follows:\n1.  **Initial State**: The pendulum is at its lowest point, with the string vertical (angle $\\theta=0$ with respect to the vertical). The ring is situated within a sector-shaped region of a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$. The field is perpendicular to the plane of the pendulum's swing. The problem states \"the ring is just inside a sector... with its edges just tangent to the ring,\" which we interpret to mean the magnetic field fully encompasses the ring at its initial $\\theta=0$ position. The ring is then given an initial horizontal velocity $v_0$.\n2.  **Motion**: As the pendulum swings upwards, the ring exits the magnetic field. Because the ring is a superconductor (zero electrical resistance), an electrical current is induced to maintain a constant total magnetic flux through the ring. This induced current interacts with the external magnetic field, creating a magnetic (Ampere) force that opposes the motion.\n3.  **Final State**: We are asked to find the minimum initial velocity $v_0$ required for the pendulum to just reach the horizontal position, where the string makes an angle $\\theta = \\pi/2$ with the vertical. At this highest point of its trajectory, the ring's velocity is momentarily zero.\n\nThe variables are defined as:\n*   `α`: Length of the massless insulating string.\n*   `m`: Mass of the conductor ring.\n*   `r`: Radius of the ring.\n*   `L`: Self-inductance of the superconducting ring.\n*   `B`: Magnetic flux density of the uniform magnetic field.\n*   `g`: Acceleration due to gravity.\n*   `v_0`: The minimum initial horizontal velocity, which is the quantity to be determined.\n\nKey assumptions and conditions:\n1.  **Point Mass Approximation**: We are given `r ≪ α`. This allows us to treat the ring as a point mass for calculating its gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy, with its position being at a distance `α` from the pivot.\n2.  **Superconducting Ring**: The ring has zero electrical resistance. This implies that the total magnetic flux passing through the ring must remain constant.\n3.  **Strong Magnetic Field**: The problem states that the torque from the Ampere force is much greater than the torque from gravity while the ring is exiting the field. This implies the exit process is rapid and occurs over a very small angle near $\\theta=0$.\n4.  **Isolated System**: The system consists of the ring and the electromagnetic field. We assume no other external non-conservative forces like air resistance are present. Therefore, the total energy of this system (mechanical energy + magnetic energy) is conserved.\n\nOur goal is to find $v_0$ by applying the principle of conservation of total energy between the initial and final states.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Total Energy of the System\nFor the isolated system of the ring and the magnetic field, the total energy is the sum of the ring's kinetic energy ($K$), its gravitational potential energy ($U_g$), and the magnetic energy stored in the ring's self-inductance ($U_{\\text{mag}}$). This total energy is conserved.\n\\[\\boxed{E_{\\text{total}} = K + U_g + U_{\\text{mag}} = \\text{constant}}\\]\nThe standard formulas for these energy components are:\n\\[\\boxed{K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{U_g = mgh}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{U_{\\text{mag}} = \\frac{1}{2}LI^2}\\]\nHere, $v$ is the speed of the ring, $h$ is its vertical height above a chosen reference level, $I$ is the current in the ring, and $L$ is its self-inductance. We define the lowest point of the swing ($\\theta=0$) as the reference level for gravitational potential energy, so $h=0$ at this point. For a pendulum of length $\\alpha$ at an angle $\\theta$ from the vertical, the height is $h = \\alpha(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mg\\alpha(1 - \\cos\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2}LI^2\n\\label{eq:total_energy_general} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy in the Initial State\nWe apply the general energy expression to the initial state of the system ($t=0$). At this moment, the pendulum is at its lowest position and is given the initial velocity $v_0$.\nThe initial conditions are:\n*   Initial angle: $\\theta_i = 0$\n*   Initial velocity: $v_i = v_0$\n*   Initial current: $I_i = 0$, as the magnetic flux through the ring has not yet begun to change.\n\nSubstituting these values into the energy components:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Initial Kinetic Energy: } &K_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \\label{eq:K_i} \\tag{2} \\\\\n\\text{Initial Gravitational Potential Energy: } &U_{g,i} = mg\\alpha(1 - \\cos 0) = 0 \\label{eq:Ug_i} \\tag{3} \\\\\n\\text{Initial Magnetic Energy: } &U_{\\text{mag},i} = \\frac{1}{2}LI_i^2 = \\frac{1}{2}L(0)^2 = 0 \\label{eq:Umag_i} \\tag{4} \\\\\n\\ \\\\\n\\text{Total Initial Energy: } &E_i = K_i + U_{g,i} + U_{\\text{mag},i} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \\label{eq:E_i} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Energy in the Final State\nNext, we evaluate the total energy when the pendulum reaches its final state. This state is defined by the string being horizontal. For the minimum required initial velocity, the ring will momentarily come to rest at this point. Before calculating the final energy, we must determine the final current $I_f$ in the ring.\n\n**Part A: Find the Final Current using Flux Conservation**\nFor a superconducting loop, the total magnetic flux through it remains constant.\n\\[\\boxed{\\Phi_{\\text{total}} = \\Phi_B + LI = \\text{constant}}\\]\nwhere $\\Phi_B$ is the flux from the external magnetic field.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Initial Flux: } &\\text{The ring is fully inside the uniform magnetic field } B \\text{.

The atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium.\n2.  The atmosphere behaves as an ideal gas.\n3.  The total mass of the atmosphere is negligible compared to the mass of Mars ($M_m$), so the gravitational field is determined solely by $M_m$.\n4.  The atmosphere extends to a great height, and the pressure approaches zero as height approaches infinity.\n\nThe goal is to derive an expression for $T(h)$ in terms of $M_m, R_m, \\mu, n, G,$ and $R$.\n\n### Step 1: Temperature, Pressure, and Density Relation from the Ideal Gas Law\nFor an ideal gas, the relationship between pressure $P$, volume $V$, number of moles $n_{\\text{mol}}$, and temperature $T$ is given by the ideal gas law.

We are given their initial state in a stationary ground frame S and their subsequent motion, and we need to find a condition on their proper accelerations such that the distance between them in frame S remains constant.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   **Frame of Reference**: The ground frame S, which is an inertial frame with a spatial coordinate $x$ and time coordinate $t$.\n*   **Trains**: Two trains, designated A and B.\n*   **Proper Length**: Both trains have the same proper (or intrinsic) length, $L_0$.\n*   **Initial State (at $t=0$ in frame S)**:\n    *   Both trains are at rest, so their initial velocities are $v_A(0) = v_B(0) = 0$.\n    *   The left end of train A is at position $x_{l,A}(0) = 0$. Since the train is at rest, its length in S is its proper length, so its right end is at $x_{r,A}(0) = L_0$.\n    *   There is a gap of length $D$ between the trains. The left end of train B is at $x_{l,B}(0) = x_{r,A}(0) + D = L_0 + D$.\n    *   Clocks located at the left end of each train are synchronized to zero in frame S: $t_A=t_B=0$.\n*   **Motion (for $t>0$ in frame S)**:\n    *   The trains begin to move with constant proper accelerations. The phrase \"constant accelerations relative to themselves\" is interpreted as constant proper acceleration.\n    *   The proper acceleration of the left end of train A is $a_A$.\n    *   The proper acceleration of the left end of train B is $a_B$.\n*   **Constraint**: The distance between the right end of train A and the left end of train B, as measured in the ground frame S, remains constant for all time $t \\ge 0$. This distance is $D(t) = x_{l,B}(t) - x_{r,A}(t)$, so the condition is $D(t) = D$.\n*   **Objective**: Determine the value of the proper acceleration $a_B$ in terms of $L_0$, $a_A$, and the speed of light $c$.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n*   The motion is purely one-dimensional along the $x$-axis.\n*   For an extended object like a train to accelerate while maintaining its proper length $L_0$, it must behave as a Born-rigid body. This means the proper distance between any two points on the train remains constant throughout the motion.\n\n### Step 1: Equation of Motion for Constant Proper Acceleration\nWe first establish the equations for velocity $v(t)$ and position $x(t)$ in the ground frame S for a particle that starts from rest at $x_0$ and moves with a constant proper acceleration $a$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe definition of proper acceleration $a$ relates the velocity change $dv'$ in the instantaneous co-moving inertial frame to the proper time interval $d\\tau$:\n\\[\\boxed{\na = \\frac{dv'}{d\\tau}\n}\\]\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for collinear motion relates the velocity in the lab frame $v$, the infinitesimal relative velocity $dv'$, and the new velocity in the lab frame $v+dv$:\n\\[\\boxed{\nv+dv = \\frac{v + dv'}{1 + \\frac{v \\, dv'}{c^2}}\n}\\]\nThe time dilation formula relates the proper time interval $d\\tau$ to the coordinate time interval $dt$ in the lab frame:\n\\[\\boxed{\nd\\tau = \\frac{dt}{\\gamma(v)} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\, dt\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nFrom the velocity addition formula, for an infinitesimal velocity change $dv'$, we can perform a first-order Taylor expansion:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv+dv &\\approx (v + dv') \\left(1 - \\frac{v \\, dv'}{c^2}\\right) = v - \\frac{v^2 dv'}{c^2} + dv' - \\frac{v(dv')^2}{c^2} \\nonumber \\\\\ndv &\\approx \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) dv' \\quad (\\text{neglecting terms of order } (dv')^2) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{dv}{dv'} &= 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\label{eq:dv_dvprime}\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing the definition of proper acceleration, $dv' = a \\, d\\tau$. Substituting this into Eq. \\eqref{eq:dv_dvprime} gives:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dv}{d\\tau} = a\\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) \\label{eq:dv_dtau}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo find the rate of change of velocity with respect to the lab frame time $t$, we use the chain rule and the time dilation formula:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{dv}{d\\tau} \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = a\\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = a\\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\label{eq:dv_dt}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo find $v(t)$, we separate variables and integrate from the initial condition $v(0)=0$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^v \\frac{dV}{\\left(1 - V^2/c^2\\right)^{3/2}} &= \\int_0^t a \\, dt' \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left[ \\frac{V}{\\sqrt{1-V^2/c^2}} \\right]_0^v &= at \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{v(t)}{\\sqrt{1-v(t)^2/c^2}} &= at \\label{eq:v_integrated}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSolving for $v(t)$ yields the velocity as a function of time:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv(t) = \\frac{at}{\\sqrt{1 + (at/c)^2}} \\label{eq:v_t}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo find the position $x(t)$, we integrate $v(t) = dx/dt$ from the initial position $x(0)=x_0$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx(t) - x_0 &= \\int_0^t v(t') \\, dt' = \\int_0^t \\frac{at'}{\\sqrt{1 + (at'/c)^2}} \\, dt' \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left[ \\frac{c^2}{a} \\sqrt{1 + (at'/c)^2} \\right]_0^t \\nonumber \\\\\nx(t) &= x_0 + \\frac{c^2}{a} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{at}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) \\label{eq:x_t}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis equation describes the worldline of a particle undergoing hyperbolic motion.\n\n### Step 2: Worldline of a Born-Rigid Accelerating Train\nFor train A to maintain its proper length $L_0$, it must be Born-rigid. This imposes a specific structure on the worldlines of all points constituting the train.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\text{Born Rigidity: The proper distance between any two infinitesimally close points of an accelerating body remains constant in their co-moving frame.}\n}\\]\nFor a body undergoing constant proper acceleration, Born rigidity implies that all points on the body follow hyperbolic worldlines in spacetime that share a common center of asymptotes. The general form of such a family of hyperbolas in the $(x, ct)$ plane is:\n\\[\\boxed{\n(x - x_c)^2 - (ct)^2 = R^2\n}\\]\nwhere $x_c$ is the common center and $R$ is the \"radius\" of a specific hyperbola, which is different for each point on the body.\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe worldline of the left end of train A starts at $x_{l,A}(0)=0$ with proper acceleration $a_A$. Using Eq. \\eqref{eq:x_t}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_{l,A}(t) = \\frac{c^2}{a_A} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_A t}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) \\label{eq:xlA}\n\\end{align}\\]\nWe can rewrite this in the standard hyperbolic form to identify its geometric properties:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_{l,A}(t) + \\frac{c^2}{a_A} &= \\frac{c^2}{a_A} \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_A t}{c}\\right)^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(x_{l,A} + \\frac{c^2}{a_A}\\right)^2 &= \\left(\\frac{c^2}{a_A}\\right)^2 \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{a_A t}{c}\\right)^2\\right) = \\left(\\frac{c^2}{a_A}\\right)^2 + (ct)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left(x_{l,A} + \\frac{c^2}{a_A}\\right)^2 - (ct)^2 &= \\left(\\frac{c^2}{a_A}\\right)^2 \\label{eq:wl_lA}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis is a hyperbola with its center of asymptotes at $x_c = -c^2/a_A$. For Born rigidity, the worldline of the right end of train A, $x_{r,A}(t)$, must be a hyperbola with the same center $x_c$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left(x_{r,A} + \\frac{c^2}{a_A}\\right)^2 - (ct)^2 = R_{r,A}^2 \\label{eq:wl_rA_general}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo find the radius $R_{r,A}$ for the right end, we use its initial condition $x_{r,A}(0) = L_0$ at $t=0$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left(L_0 + \\frac{c^2}{a_A}\\right)^2 - (c \\cdot 0)^2 = R_{r,A}^2 \\implies R_{r,A} = L_0 + \\frac{c^2}{a_A} \\label{eq:R_val}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus, the worldline of the right end of train A is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left(x_{r,A} + \\frac{c^2}{a_A}\\right)^2 - (ct)^2 = \\left(L_0 + \\frac{c^2}{a_A}\\right)^2 \\label{eq:wl_rA}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Proper Acceleration of the Right End of Train A\nEach hyperbolic worldline corresponds to a motion with a constant proper acceleration. We can find the proper acceleration of the right end of train A, denoted $a_{r,A}$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe proper acceleration $a$ for a hyperbolic worldline of the form $(x - x_c)^2 - (ct)^2 = R^2$ is related to its radius $R$ by:\n\\[\\boxed{\na = \\frac{c^2}{R}\n}\\]\nThis relation is a direct consequence of comparing the general hyperbolic equation with the derived worldline equation Eq. \\eqref{eq:x_t}, as shown by rearranging it into the form of Eq. \\eqref{eq:wl_lA}.\n\n**Derivation**:\nFrom Eq. \\eqref{eq:wl_rA}, the radius of the hyperbola for the right end of train A is $R_{r,A} = L_0 + c^2/a_A$. Using the principle above, the proper acceleration of the right end of train A is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\na_{r,A} = \\frac{c^2}{R_{r,A}} = \\frac{c^2}{L_0 + c^2/a_A} \\label{eq:a_rA_calc}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\\[\\begin{align}\na_{r,A} = \\frac{c^2 a_A}{a_A L_0 + c^2} = \\frac{a_A}{1 + \\frac{a_A L_0}{c^2}} \\label{eq:a_rA}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis result shows that for a Born-rigid rod, the front end ($a_{r,A}$) must have a smaller proper acceleration than the rear end ($a_A$) to maintain its structure.\n\n### Step 4: Setting up the Constant Distance Condition\nWe now write the expressions for the positions of the right end of train A and the left end of train B and apply the condition that the distance between them is always $D$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe position of a particle undergoing hyperbolic motion is given by Eq. \\eqref{eq:x_t}:\n\\[\\boxed{\nx(t) = x_0 + \\frac{c^2}{a} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{at}{c}\\right)^{2}} - 1 \\right)\n}\\]\nThe problem states that the distance between the trains is constant:\n\\[\\boxed{\nx_{l,B}(t) - x_{r,A}(t) = D \\quad \\text{for all } t \\ge 0\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe right end of train A starts at $x_{r,A}(0) = L_0$ and has proper acceleration $a_{r,A}$. Its position at time $t$ is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_{r,A}(t) = L_0 + \\frac{c^2}{a_{r,A}} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_{r,A} t}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) \\label{eq:xrA_t}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe left end of train B starts at $x_{l,B}(0) = L_0 + D$ and has proper acceleration $a_B$. Its position at time $t$ is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_{l,B}(t) = (L_0 + D) + \\frac{c^2}{a_B} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_B t}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) \\label{eq:xlB_t}\n\\end{align}\\]\nApplying the constant distance condition:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_{l,B}(t) - x_{r,A}(t) &= D \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left[ (L_0 + D) + \\frac{c^2}{a_B} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_B t}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) \\right] - \\left[ L_0 + \\frac{c^2}{a_{r,A}} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_{r,A} t}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) \\right] &= D \\nonumber \\\\\nD + \\frac{c^2}{a_B} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_B t}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) - \\frac{c^2}{a_{r,A}} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_{r,A} t}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) &= D \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{c^2}{a_B} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_B t}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) &= \\frac{c^2}{a_{r,A}} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a_{r,A} t}{c}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right) \\label{eq:condition}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solving for $a_B$\nThe condition derived in the previous step must hold for all $t \\ge 0$. This powerful constraint allows us to determine $a_B$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\text{If a function } f(x) \\text{ is strictly monotonic over its domain, then the equality } f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\text{ implies that } x_1 = x_2.\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nThe equation derived in Step 4, Eq. \\eqref{eq:condition}, must hold for all $t \\ge 0$.

The condition is $f(a_B, t) = f(a_{r,A}, t)$.\nFor any fixed time $t > 0$, we can show that the function $f(a,t)$ is strictly increasing with respect to the acceleration $a$ (for $a>0$).

The rods are arranged symmetrically in a vertical plane, forming an A-frame structure. Their upper ends are connected by a short, flexible, massless string, which acts as a hinge. Their lower ends are free to slide without friction on a horizontal tabletop. The system is subject to a uniform gravitational field with acceleration $g$.\n\nInitially, the system is held stationary by a thin, massless string connecting the centers of the two rods. In this initial configuration, the rods form an angle $\\theta_0$ with the horizontal tabletop.\n\nThe process begins when the central string is cut, allowing the A-frame to collapse under gravity. The rods fall until they lie flat on the table. The phrase \"the rods fall vertically\" is interpreted to mean that the center of mass of the entire two-rod system moves purely in the vertical direction, which is consistent with the symmetry of the setup for any initial angle $\\theta_0$.\n\nThe question asks for the magnitude of the velocity $v$ of the rods just before they hit the table. The phrase \"velocity of the rods\" is ambiguous, as different points on the rods have different velocities. We will interpret this as the velocity of the top hinge, as it is a unique and important point in the system whose motion characterizes the collapse. The final moment is when the rods are horizontal, i.e., the angle they make with the table is $\\theta=0$.\n\nThe variables involved are:\n*   $m$: mass of each rod.\n*   $l$: length of each rod.\n*   $g$: acceleration due to gravity.\n*   $\\theta_0$: the initial angle each rod makes with the horizontal table.\n*   $\\theta$: the instantaneous angle a rod makes with the horizontal table.\n*   $v$: the magnitude of the velocity of the top hinge when the rods hit the table (i.e., when $\\theta=0$).\n\nWe assume the rods are rigid and uniform, the strings are massless, the hinge is ideal (frictionless), and the tabletop is frictionless.\n\n### Step 1: Kinematics of the System\nWe establish a Cartesian coordinate system to describe the motion. Let the horizontal tabletop be the x-axis and the vertical axis of symmetry be the y-axis. The origin $(0,0)$ is on the table, directly below the top hinge.\n\nThe velocity of a point is the time derivative of its position vector.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt}}\\]\nThe position of the top hinge, P, is always on the y-axis. Its height is determined by the rod's length $l$ and the angle $\\theta$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{r}_P = (0, l\\sin\\theta)\n\\label{eq:pos_P} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe center of mass (CM) of the right rod is at its geometric center. Its coordinates are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{r}_{CM} = \\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\cos\\theta, \\frac{l}{2}\\sin\\theta\\right)\n\\label{eq:pos_CM} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe velocity of the top hinge $\\vec{v}_P$ is found by differentiating its position with respect to time, using the chain rule where $\\dot{\\theta} = d\\theta/dt$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{v}_P = \\frac{d\\vec{r}_P}{dt} = (0, l\\cos\\theta \\dot{\\theta})\n\\label{eq:vel_P} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSimilarly, the velocity of the CM of the right rod is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{v}_{CM} = \\frac{d\\vec{r}_{CM}}{dt} = \\left(-\\frac{l}{2}\\sin\\theta \\dot{\\theta}, \\frac{l}{2}\\cos\\theta \\dot{\\theta}\\right)\n\\label{eq:vel_CM} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Mechanical Energy of the System\nThe system consists of the two rods. The forces acting on the system are gravity, the normal forces from the table, and internal forces at the hinge. Gravity is a conservative force. The normal forces act perpendicular to the horizontal motion of the lower ends of the rods, so they do no work. There is no friction. Therefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved.\n\\[\n\\boxed{E = K + U = \\text{constant}}\n\\]\nHere, $K$ is the total kinetic energy and $U$ is the total gravitational potential energy.\n\n**Potential Energy (U):**\nThe gravitational potential energy of a body is determined by the height of its center of mass. We set the potential energy reference $U=0$ at the tabletop ($y=0$).\n\\[\n\\boxed{U_g = mgy_{CM}}\n\\]\nThe height of the CM of each rod is $y_{CM} = \\frac{l}{2}\\sin\\theta$. Since there are two identical rods, the total potential energy is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU = 2 \\times \\left(mg y_{CM}\\right) = 2 \\left(mg \\frac{l}{2}\\sin\\theta\\right) = mgl\\sin\\theta\n\\label{eq:PE} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n**Kinetic Energy (K):**\nThe kinetic energy of a rigid body in planar motion is the sum of the translational kinetic energy of its center of mass and the rotational kinetic energy about its center of mass.\n\\[\n\\boxed{K_{\\text{rod}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{CM}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\\omega^2}\n\\]\nThe moment of inertia of a thin rod of mass $m$ and length $l$ about its center is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{I_{CM} = \\frac{1}{12}ml^2}\n\\]\nThe squared speed of the CM of one rod is found from Eq. \\eqref{eq:vel_CM}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_{CM}^2 = \\left(-\\frac{l}{2}\\sin\\theta \\dot{\\theta}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\cos\\theta \\dot{\\theta}\\right)^2 = \\frac{l^2\\dot{\\theta}^2}{4}(\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) = \\frac{l^2\\dot{\\theta}^2}{4}\n\\label{eq:v_CM_sq} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe angular speed of the rod is $\\omega = |\\dot{\\theta}|$, so $\\omega^2 = \\dot{\\theta}^2$. The kinetic energy of one rod is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nK_{\\text{one rod}} &= \\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{l^2\\dot{\\theta}^2}{4}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{12}ml^2\\right)\\dot{\\theta}^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{8}ml^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\frac{1}{24}ml^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{3+1}{24}\\right)ml^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 = \\frac{1}{6}ml^2\\dot{\\theta}^2\n\\label{eq:KE_one} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe total kinetic energy of the system of two identical rods is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nK = 2 \\times K_{\\text{one rod}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{6}ml^2\\dot{\\theta}^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}ml^2\\dot{\\theta}^2\n\\label{eq:KE_total} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Application of Energy Conservation\nThe total mechanical energy $E = K+U$ is conserved throughout the motion. We equate the total energy of the initial state to the total energy of the final state.\n\\[\n\\boxed{K_f + U_f = K_i + U_i}\n\\]\n**Initial State:** The rods are at rest at an angle $\\theta_i = \\theta_0$.\nThe initial kinetic energy is zero because the system is stationary.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nK_i = 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe initial potential energy is calculated using Eq. \\eqref{eq:PE} at $\\theta = \\theta_0$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU_i = mgl\\sin(\\theta_0)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo, the total initial energy is $E_i = K_i + U_i = mgl\\sin(\\theta_0)$.\n\n**Final State:** The rods have hit the table, so their final angle is $\\theta_f = 0$. Let the angular velocity at this instant be $\\dot{\\theta}_f$.\nThe final kinetic energy is given by Eq. \\eqref{eq:KE_total} at the final instant.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nK_f = \\frac{1}{3}ml^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe final potential energy is calculated using Eq. \\eqref{eq:PE} at $\\theta = 0$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU_f = mgl\\sin(0) = 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo, the total final energy is $E_f = K_f + U_f = \\frac{1}{3}ml^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2$.\n\nBy conservation of energy, $E_f = E_i$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{3}ml^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2 &= mgl\\sin(\\theta_0) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta}_f^2 &= \\frac{3mgl\\sin(\\theta_0)}{ml^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta}_f^2 &= \\frac{3g\\sin(\\theta_0)}{l}\n\\label{eq:theta_dot_final} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of the Final Velocity\nWe want to find the magnitude of the velocity of the top hinge, $v$, when the rods hit the table. This corresponds to the final state where $\\theta_f=0$. The magnitude of the hinge's velocity is given by $v_P = |l\\cos\\theta \\dot{\\theta}|$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:vel_P}.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv = v_P(\\theta=0) &= |l\\cos(0) \\dot{\\theta}_f| \\nonumber \\\\\n&= l |\\dot{\\theta}_f| \\nonumber \\\\\n&= l \\sqrt{\\dot{\\theta}_f^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= l \\sqrt{\\frac{3g\\sin(\\theta_0)}{l}} \\quad (\\text{using eq. \\ref{eq:theta_dot_final}}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{l^2 \\cdot \\frac{3g\\sin(\\theta_0)}{l}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{3gl\\sin(\\theta_0)}\n\\label{eq:final_v} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe magnitude of the velocity $v$ of the top hinge of the rods just before they touch the tabletop is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{v = \\sqrt{3gl\\sin(\\theta_0)}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The four vertices of the square serve as the terminals and are numbered sequentially in a clockwise manner as 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe electrical behavior of this network is described by a set of linear equations relating the potentials at terminals 1, 2, and 3 to the currents flowing into them. Terminal 0 is designated as the reference terminal, meaning its potential is held at zero, i.e., $V_0 = 0$. The potentials at the other terminals are denoted by $V_1, V_2, V_3$, and the currents flowing into the network at these terminals are $I_1, I_2, I_3$.\n\nThe relationship between the potentials and currents for terminals $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is given by the matrix equation:\n$V_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{ij} I_j$.\nThe coefficients $a_{ij}$ form the resistance matrix, which is symmetric ($a_{ij} = a_{ji}$) due to reciprocity.

The potentials at terminals $k$ and $l$ are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_k &= \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{kj} I_j = a_{kk}I_k + a_{kl}I_l + a_{km}I_m = a_{kk}I - a_{kl}I \\\\\nV_l &= \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{lj} I_j = a_{lk}I_k + a_{ll}I_l + a_{lm}I_m = a_{lk}I - a_{ll}I\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe potential difference between terminals $k$ and $l$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_k - V_l &= (a_{kk}I - a_{kl}I) - (a_{lk}I - a_{ll}I) \\\\\n&= (a_{kk} + a_{ll} - a_{kl} - a_{lk})I\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing the symmetry property $a_{kl} = a_{lk}$, this becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_k - V_l = (a_{kk} + a_{ll} - 2a_{kl})I\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, the equivalent resistance is $R_{kl} = \\frac{V_k - V_l}{I} = a_{kk} + a_{ll} - 2a_{kl}$. We can now solve for $a_{kl}$:\n*   **To find $a_{12}$**: Terminals 1 and 2 are adjacent, so $R_{12} = R_1$.\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    R_{12} &= a_{11} + a_{22} - 2a_{12} \\\\\n    R_1 &= R_1 + R_2 - 2a_{12} \\\\\n    0 &= R_2 - 2a_{12} \\implies a_{12} = \\frac{R_2}{2}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n*   **To find $a_{23}$**: Terminals 2 and 3 are adjacent, so $R_{23} = R_1$.\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    R_{23} &= a_{22} + a_{33} - 2a_{23} \\\\\n    R_1 &= R_2 + R_1 - 2a_{23} \\\\\n    0 &= R_2 - 2a_{23} \\implies a_{23} = \\frac{R_2}{2}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n*   **To find $a_{13}$**: Terminals 1 and 3 are opposite, so $R_{13} = R_2$.\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    R_{13} &= a_{11} + a_{33} - 2a_{13} \\\\\n    R_2 &= R_1 + R_1 - 2a_{13} \\\\\n    R_2 &= 2R_1 - 2a_{13} \\implies a_{13} = R_1 - \\frac{R_2}{2}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the circuit with the shorted terminals\nWe now analyze the circuit under the specified condition: terminals 0 and 3 are short-circuited. We want to find the equivalent resistance between terminals 1 and 2. To do this, we inject a current $I$ at terminal 1 and extract it at terminal 2.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nA short circuit between two terminals means they are at the same electric potential. Since $V_0=0$ is the reference potential, the short-circuit condition is:\n\\[\\boxed{\nV_3 = V_0 = 0\n}\\]\nThe relationship between terminal potentials and currents remains valid:\n\\[\\boxed{\nV_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{ij} I_j\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nThe experimental setup to measure the required resistance is as follows:\n*   Current $I$ is injected at terminal 1: $I_1 = I$.\n*   Current $I$ is extracted from terminal 2: $I_2 = -I$.\n*   Terminals 0 and 3 are short-circuited, which implies $V_3 = 0$. This condition will determine the current $I_3$ that flows into terminal 3.\n\nWe use the condition $V_3=0$ to find $I_3$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_3 &= a_{31}I_1 + a_{32}I_2 + a_{33}I_3 \\\\\n0 &= a_{31}(I) + a_{32}(-I) + a_{33}I_3 \\\\\n0 &= (a_{31} - a_{32})I + a_{33}I_3\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSolving for $I_3$ in terms of $I$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_3 = -\\frac{a_{31} - a_{32}}{a_{33}}I = \\frac{a_{32} - a_{31}}{a_{33}}I \\label{eq:I3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the coefficient values we found (using symmetry $a_{31}=a_{13}$ and $a_{32}=a_{23}$):\n$a_{13} = R_1 - R_2/2$, $a_{23} = R_2/2$, $a_{33} = R_1$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_3 = \\frac{R_2/2 - (R_1 - R_2/2)}{R_1}I = \\frac{R_2 - R_1}{R_1}I \\label{eq:I3_val}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the potential difference and equivalent resistance\nWith all currents ($I_1, I_2, I_3$) expressed in terms of $I$, we can calculate the potential difference $V_1 - V_2$ and subsequently the equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nThe definition of the required equivalent resistance is:\n\\[\\boxed{\nR_{eq} = \\frac{V_1 - V_2}{I}\n}\\]\nThe relationship between terminal potentials and currents is:\n\\[\\boxed{\nV_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{ij} I_j\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nWe express the potentials $V_1$ and $V_2$ using the known currents $I_1=I$, $I_2=-I$, and $I_3$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_1 &= a_{11}I_1 + a_{12}I_2 + a_{13}I_3 = a_{11}I - a_{12}I + a_{13}I_3 \\\\\nV_2 &= a_{21}I_1 + a_{22}I_2 + a_{23}I_3 = a_{21}I - a_{22}I + a_{23}I_3\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe potential difference is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_1 - V_2 &= (a_{11}I - a_{12}I + a_{13}I_3) - (a_{21}I - a_{22}I + a_{23}I_3) \\\\\n&= (a_{11} - a_{21})I - (a_{12} - a_{22})I + (a_{13} - a_{23})I_3 \\\\\n&= (a_{11} - 2a_{12} + a_{22})I + (a_{13} - a_{23})I_3 \\quad (\\text{using } a_{12}=a_{21}) \\label{eq:V1V2_general}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we substitute the values of the coefficients and the expression for $I_3$ from eq. \\eqref{eq:I3_val}:\n*   $a_{11} - 2a_{12} + a_{22} = R_1 - 2(R_2/2) + R_2 = R_1$.\n*   $a_{13} - a_{23} = (R_1 - R_2/2) - (R_2/2) = R_1 - R_2$.\n*   $I_3 = \\frac{R_2 - R_1}{R_1}I$.\n\nSubstituting these into eq. \\eqref{eq:V1V2_general}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_1 - V_2 &= (R_1)I + (R_1 - R_2)\\left(\\frac{R_2 - R_1}{R_1}\\right)I \\\\\n&= R_1 I - \\frac{(R_1 - R_2)^2}{R_1}I \\\\\n&= \\left( \\frac{R_1^2 - (R_1^2 - 2R_1R_2 + R_2^2)}{R_1} \\right)I \\\\\n&= \\left( \\frac{R_1^2 - R_1^2 + 2R_1R_2 - R_2^2}{R_1} \\right)I \\\\\n&= \\frac{2R_1R_2 - R_2^2}{R_1}I \\\\\n&= \\frac{R_2(2R_1 - R_2)}{R_1}I \\label{eq:V1V2_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$ is therefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nR_{eq} = \\frac{V_1 - V_2}{I} = \\frac{R_2(2R_1 - R_2)}{R_1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe equivalent resistance between the other two vertices (1 and 2) when a pair of adjacent vertices (0 and 3) is short-circuited is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{R_{eq} = \\frac{R_2(2R_1 - R_2)}{R_1}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

We are asked to determine the period of small vertical oscillations of the ring around a stable equilibrium position.\n\n**System Parameters and Geometry:**\n*   **Solenoid:** A semi-infinite solenoid with radius $R$ and $n$ turns per unit length. It is connected to a constant current source, carrying a current $I$.\n*   **Coordinate System:** A cylindrical coordinate system $(\\rho, \\theta, z)$ is used. The solenoid's axis of symmetry coincides with the $z$-axis, and the solenoid occupies the region $z \\le 0$. The current $I$ flows in the positive azimuthal direction ($+\\hat{\\theta}$), which is counter-clockwise when viewed from the positive $z$-axis.\n*   **Superconducting Ring:** A metal ring of mass $m$, radius $r$, and self-inductance $L$. It is constrained to move along the $z$-axis, with its center at position $z$. A key geometric assumption is that the ring's radius is much smaller than the solenoid's radius, i.e., $r \\ll R$.\n*   **Gravitational Field:** A uniform gravitational field is present, described by the gravitational acceleration vector $\\vec{g} = -g\\hat{z}$.\n\n**Initial and Boundary Conditions:**\n*   The ring is initially at a position very far from the solenoid ($z \\to \\infty$), where the magnetic field from the solenoid is negligible.\n*   At this distant location, the ring transitions into a superconducting state, carrying a persistent initial current $I_0$ which flows in the positive $\\hat{\\theta}$ direction.\n*   The ring remains in the superconducting state throughout its subsequent motion.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe problem asks for the period, $T$, of small oscillations of the ring around an equilibrium position $z_0 > 0$, given that this equilibrium is stable. For levitation at $z_0 > 0$, the magnetic force must be repulsive, pointing upwards to counteract the downward gravitational force. This imposes conditions on the direction of the current in the ring, which will be analyzed. The final expression for $T$ can be in terms of the given parameters: $n, I, I_0, r, R, L, m, g$, and the equilibrium position $z_0$.\n\n### Step 1: Magnetic Field of the Semi-Infinite Solenoid\nTo find the force on the ring, we first need the magnetic field produced by the solenoid. We calculate the magnetic field component along the axis of symmetry, $B_z(z)$, for any point $z>0$. We model the solenoid as a continuous distribution of circular current loops. The on-axis magnetic field of a single circular current loop of radius $R$ at an axial distance $d$ from its center, carrying current $I_{\\text{loop}}$, is given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B_z = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_{\\text{loop}} R^2}{2(d^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}}\n\\]\nA differential segment of the solenoid of length $dz'$ at position $z' \\le 0$ acts as a current loop with an effective current $I_{\\text{loop}} = nI dz'$. The axial distance from this loop to a point $z>0$ on the axis is $d = z-z'$. To find the total field at $z$, we integrate the contributions from all such loops from $z'=-\\infty$ to $z'=0$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nB_z(z) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\frac{\\mu_0 (nI dz') R^2}{2((z-z')^2 + R^2)^{3/2}} \\label{eq:B_integral} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mu_0 n I R^2}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\frac{dz'}{((z-z')^2 + R^2)^{3/2}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{Let } u = z' - z, \\text{ so } du = dz'. \\text{ The integration limits for } u \\text{ are } -\\infty \\text{ and } -z. \\nonumber \\\\\nB_z(z) &= \\frac{\\mu_0 n I R^2}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{-z} \\frac{du}{(u^2 + R^2)^{3/2}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mu_0 n I R^2}{2} \\left[ \\frac{u}{R^2 \\sqrt{u^2 + R^2}} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{-z} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2} \\left( \\frac{-z}{\\sqrt{(-z)^2 + R^2}} - \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{u^2 + R^2}} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2} \\left( \\frac{-z}{\\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}} - (-1) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}} \\right) \\label{eq:B_field}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is the magnetic field component along the $z$-axis at a position $z>0$. Since $I>0$, $B_z(z)$ is positive for all $z>0$.\n\n### Step 2: Current in the Superconducting Ring\nA fundamental property of a perfect superconductor is that the total magnetic flux passing through it remains constant over time.\n\\[\\boxed{\\Phi_{\\text{total}} = \\Phi_{\\text{ext}}(z) + \\Phi_{\\text{self}}(z) = \\text{constant}}\\]\nThe total flux is the sum of the flux from the external magnetic field (from the solenoid), $\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}(z)$, and the flux from the ring's own current (self-flux), $\\Phi_{\\text{self}}(z)$. The self-flux is defined by the ring's self-inductance $L$ and its current $I_{\\text{ring}}(z)$.\n\\[\\boxed{\\Phi_{\\text{self}}(z) = L I_{\\text{ring}}(z)}\\]\nThe external flux is the integral of the solenoid's magnetic field over the area of the ring.\n\\[\\boxed{\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}(z) = \\int_{\\text{ring}} \\vec{B}_{\\text{solenoid}} \\cdot d\\vec{A}}\\]\nGiven the condition $r \\ll R$, the magnetic field $B_z(z)$ from the solenoid can be considered uniform over the ring's area $A = \\pi r^2$. The area vector is $d\\vec{A} = dA \\hat{z}$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}(z) \\approx B_z(z) A = \\pi r^2 B_z(z) \\label{eq:flux_ext}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe constant total flux is determined by the initial conditions. At $z \\to \\infty$, the solenoid's field $B_z(\\infty) = \\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2}(1-1) = 0$, so the external flux $\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}(\\infty) = 0$. The initial current in the ring is given as $I_{\\text{ring}}(\\infty) = I_0$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Phi_{\\text{total}} &= \\Phi_{\\text{ext}}(\\infty) + \\Phi_{\\text{self}}(\\infty) = 0 + L I_0 = L I_0 \\label{eq:flux_const}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBy flux conservation, for any position $z$, we have $\\pi r^2 B_z(z) + L I_{\\text{ring}}(z) = L I_0$. We can solve for the current in the ring at any position $z$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_{\\text{ring}}(z) &= \\frac{L I_0 - \\pi r^2 B_z(z)}{L} = I_0 - \\frac{\\pi r^2}{L} B_z(z) \\label{eq:I_ring}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe term $-\\frac{\\pi r^2}{L} B_z(z)$ represents the induced current. According to Lenz's law, as the ring approaches the solenoid, the external flux (in the $+\\hat{z}$ direction) increases, so an opposing current is induced to create a flux in the $-\\hat{z}$ direction. This corresponds to a current in the $-\\hat{\\theta}$ direction.\n\n### Step 3: Magnetic Force on the Ring\nThe magnetic force on the current-carrying ring is given by the integral of the Lorentz force over the closed loop of the ring.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{\\text{mag}} = \\oint I_{\\text{ring}} d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{B}_{\\text{solenoid}}}\\]\nTo evaluate this, we need the magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{\\text{solenoid}}$ at the location of the ring wire $(\\rho=r)$. For an axisymmetric field, Gauss's law for magnetism, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$, provides a relationship between the radial and axial components of the field.\n\\[\\boxed{\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial(\\rho B_\\rho)}{\\partial \\rho} + \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z} = 0}\\]\nFor small $\\rho$ near the axis, we can approximate $\\frac{\\partial B_z(\\rho,z)}{\\partial z} \\approx \\frac{dB_z(0,z)}{dz} \\equiv \\frac{dB_z}{dz}$. Integrating with respect to $\\rho$ gives $\\rho B_\\rho \\approx -\\int_0^\\rho \\rho' \\frac{dB_z}{dz} d\\rho' = -\\frac{\\rho^2}{2}\\frac{dB_z}{dz}$. Thus, the radial component is approximately:\n\\[\\boxed{B_\\rho(\\rho, z) \\approx -\\frac{\\rho}{2} \\frac{dB_z(z)}{dz}}\\]\nThe current element on the ring is $d\\vec{l} = r d\\theta \\hat{\\theta}$. The magnetic field at the ring is $\\vec{B}(r,z) \\approx B_z(z)\\hat{z} + B_\\rho(r,z)\\hat{\\rho}$. Substituting into the Lorentz force integral:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{F}_{\\text{mag}} &= \\int_0^{2\\pi} I_{\\text{ring}}(z) (r d\\theta \\hat{\\theta}) \\times \\left( B_z(z) \\hat{z} + B_\\rho(r, z) \\hat{\\rho} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= I_{\\text{ring}}(z) r \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( B_z(z) (\\hat{\\theta} \\times \\hat{z}) + B_\\rho(r, z) (\\hat{\\theta} \\times \\hat{\\rho}) \\right) d\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= I_{\\text{ring}}(z) r \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( B_z(z) \\hat{\\rho} - B_\\rho(r, z) \\hat{z} \\right) d\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{The radial unit vector } \\hat{\\rho} = \\cos\\theta\\hat{x} + \\sin\\theta\\hat{y} \\text{ integrates to zero over } [0, 2\\pi]. \\nonumber \\\\\n\\vec{F}_{\\text{mag}} &= -I_{\\text{ring}}(z) r \\hat{z} \\int_0^{2\\pi} B_\\rho(r, z) d\\theta = -I_{\\text{ring}}(z) r \\hat{z} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left(-\\frac{r}{2} \\frac{dB_z(z)}{dz}\\right) d\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= I_{\\text{ring}}(z) \\frac{r^2}{2} \\frac{dB_z}{dz} \\hat{z} (2\\pi) = I_{\\text{ring}}(z) (\\pi r^2) \\frac{dB_z}{dz} \\hat{z} \\label{eq:Force_formula}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe force is purely in the $z$-direction, $F_z(z) = I_{\\text{ring}}(z) (\\pi r^2) \\frac{dB_z}{dz}$. We need the derivative of $B_z(z)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dB_z}{dz} &= \\frac{d}{dz} \\left[ \\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}} \\right) \\right] = -\\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2} \\frac{d}{dz} \\left( \\frac{z}{(z^2+R^2)^{1/2}} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2} \\left( \\frac{(z^2+R^2)^{1/2}(1) - z \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(z^2+R^2)^{-1/2}(2z)}{z^2+R^2} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2} \\left( \\frac{(z^2+R^2) - z^2}{(z^2+R^2)^{3/2}} \\right) = -\\frac{\\mu_0 n I R^2}{2(z^2+R^2)^{3/2}} \\label{eq:dB_dz}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince all parameters are positive, $\\frac{dB_z}{dz} < 0$. For the magnetic force $F_z$ to be positive (repulsive, pointing upwards), we must have $I_{\\text{ring}}(z) < 0$. This means the current in the ring must flow in the direction opposite to the solenoid current, which is consistent with a repulsive force.\n\n### Step 4: Equilibrium and Stability Analysis\nThe total vertical force on the ring is the sum of the magnetic force $F_z(z)$ and the gravitational force $F_g = -mg$.\n\\[\\boxed{F_{\\text{net}}(z) = F_z(z) + F_g = F_z(z) - mg}\\]\nAt an equilibrium position $z_0$, the net force is zero. The upward magnetic force must balance the downward gravitational force.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF_{\\text{net}}(z_0) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad F_z(z_0) = mg \\label{eq:Equilibrium}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor the equilibrium to be stable, any small displacement from $z_0$ must result in a restoring force. This corresponds to a local minimum of the potential energy, which requires the derivative of the net force with respect to position to be negative at the equilibrium point.\n\\[\\boxed{\\left.\\frac{dF_{\\text{net}}}{dz}\\right|_{z_0} < 0}\\]\nSince the gravitational force is constant, this condition simplifies to $\\left.\\frac{dF_z}{dz}\\right|_{z_0} < 0$. As shown in Step 3, equilibrium requires $I_{ring}(z_0) < 0$. The second derivative of the magnetic field is $\\frac{d^2B_z}{dz^2} = \\frac{3\\mu_0 n I R^2 z}{2(z^2+R^2)^{5/2}} > 0$ for $z>0$. Differentiating the force gives $\\frac{dF_z}{dz} = \\frac{dI_{ring}}{dz}(\\pi r^2 \\frac{dB_z}{dz}) + I_{ring}(\\pi r^2 \\frac{d^2B_z}{dz^2}) = -\\frac{(\\pi r^2)^2}{L}(\\frac{dB_z}{dz})^2 + I_{ring}(\\pi r^2 \\frac{d^2B_z}{dz^2})$. At $z_0$, the first term is negative. The second term is a product of $I_{ring}(z_0)<0$ and other positive terms, so it is also negative. Thus, $\\left.\\frac{dF_z}{dz}\\right|_{z_0}$ is always negative, and any equilibrium point is stable.\n\n### Step 5: Period of Small Oscillations\nFor small oscillations around the stable equilibrium position $z_0$, we consider a small displacement $\\delta z$, such that $z = z_0 + \\delta z$. The net force can be approximated by a first-order Taylor expansion.\n\\[\\boxed{F_{\\text{net}}(z_0+\\delta z) \\approx F_{\\text{net}}(z_0) + \\left.\\frac{dF_{\\text{net}}}{dz}\\right|_{z_0} \\delta z}\\]\nUsing Newton's second law, $m\\ddot{\\delta z} = F_{\\text{net}}$, and the equilibrium condition $F_{\\text{net}}(z_0)=0$, the equation of motion for the displacement becomes that of a simple harmonic oscillator:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm\\ddot{\\delta z} = \\left(\\left.\\frac{dF_z}{dz}\\right|_{z_0}\\right) \\delta z = -k \\delta z\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe effective spring constant is $k = -\\left.\\frac{dF_z}{dz}\\right|_{z_0}$. The period of oscillation $T$ is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}}\\]\nTo calculate $k$, we differentiate $F_z(z) = \\left(I_0 - \\frac{\\pi r^2}{L}B_z(z)\\right) \\left(\\pi r^2 \\frac{dB_z}{dz}\\right)$. For convenience, let's define two functions based on the structure of the force expression:\n$H(z) = \\frac{\\pi r^2 B_z(z)}{L} - I_0$ and $G(z) = -\\pi r^2 \\frac{dB_z}{dz}$.\nWith these definitions, the force is $F_z(z) = -I_{ring}(z) G(z) = -(-H(z)) G(z) = H(z)G(z)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dF_z}{dz} &= \\frac{d}{dz}(H(z)G(z)) = \\frac{dH}{dz}G(z) + H(z)\\frac{dG}{dz} \\label{eq:dFdz_rule}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe find the derivatives of $H(z)$ and $G(z)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dH}{dz} &= \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{\\pi r^2}{L} B_z(z) - I_0\\right) = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{L} \\frac{dB_z}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{L} \\left(-\\frac{G(z)}{\\pi r^2}\\right) = -\\frac{G(z)}{L} \\label{eq:dHdz_clean} \\\\\n\\frac{dG}{dz} &= \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(-\\pi r^2 \\frac{dB_z}{dz}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_0 n I \\pi r^2 R^2}{2}(z^2+R^2)^{-3/2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mu_0 n I \\pi r^2 R^2}{2} \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}(z^2+R^2)^{-5/2}(2z)\\right) = -\\frac{3z}{z^2+R^2} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0 n I \\pi r^2 R^2}{2(z^2+R^2)^{3/2}}\\right) = -\\frac{3z}{z^2+R^2} G(z) \\label{eq:dGdz_clean}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow substitute these derivatives into the expression for $\\left.\\frac{dF_z}{dz}\\right|_{z_0}$. At equilibrium, $F_z(z_0) = H(z_0)G(z_0) = mg$, so $H(z_0) = mg/G(z_0)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left.\\frac{dF_z}{dz}\\right|_{z_0} &= \\left.\\frac{dH}{dz}\\right|_{z_0} G(z_0) + H(z_0)\\left.\\frac{dG}{dz}\\right|_{z_0} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left(-\\frac{G(z_0)}{L}\\right) G(z_0) + \\frac{mg}{G(z_0)} \\left(-\\frac{3z_0}{z_0^2+R^2} G(z_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{G(z_0)^2}{L} - \\frac{3mg z_0}{z_0^2+R^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{where } G(z_0) &= -\\pi r^2 \\left.\\frac{dB_z}{dz}\\right|_{z_0} = \\frac{\\mu_0 n I \\pi r^2 R^2}{2(z_0^2+R^2)^{3/2}}. \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left.\\frac{dF_z}{dz}\\right|_{z_0} &= -\\frac{1}{L}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_0 n I \\pi r^2 R^2}{2(z_0^2+R^2)^{3/2}}\\right)^2 - \\frac{3mg z_0}{z_0^2+R^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\left( \\frac{(\\mu_0 n I \\pi r^2)^2 R^4}{4L(z_0^2+R^2)^3} + \\frac{3mg z_0}{z_0^2+R^2} \\right) \\label{eq:dF_dz_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe spring constant $k$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk = -\\left.\\frac{dF_z}{dz}\\right|_{z_0} = \\frac{3mg z_0}{z_0^2+R^2} + \\frac{(\\mu_0 n I \\pi r^2)^2 R^4}{4L(z_0^2+R^2)^3} \\label{eq:k_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFinally, the period of oscillation is $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{m/k}$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe period of small oscillations $T$ near the stable equilibrium position $z_0$ is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\frac{3mg z_0}{z_0^2+R^2} + \\frac{(\\mu_0 n I \\pi r^2)^2 R^4}{4L(z_0^2+R^2)^3}}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The capacitor is constructed from two parallel, highly conductive plates, each with area $A$. The plates are separated by a total distance of $(h_1 + h_2)$. The space between the plates is filled by two different dielectric materials stacked in series.\n\nThe properties of the two dielectric materials are:\n*   **Material 1**: Thickness $h_1$, dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_1$, and conductivity $\\sigma_1$.\n*   **Material 2**: Thickness $h_2$, dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_2$, and conductivity $\\sigma_2$.\n\nThe capacitor is connected in a circuit with a power source providing a constant electromotive force (EMF) $U_0$. At time $t=0$, a switch is closed, connecting the power source to the capacitor, which is initially uncharged. The goal is to determine the total current $I(t)$ flowing through the circuit for all times $t > 0$.\n\nWe will use the following variables in our analysis:\n*   $E_1(t)$, $E_2(t)$: The magnitudes of the electric fields in material 1 and 2, respectively.\n*   $j_1(t)$, $j_2(t)$: The magnitudes of the conduction current densities in material 1 and 2.\n*   $\\sigma_f(t)$: The free surface charge density that accumulates at the interface between the two dielectrics.\n*   $I(t)$: The total current flowing through the switch.\n\nWe make the following assumptions:\n1.  The electric field and current density are uniform within each dielectric layer and are directed perpendicular to the capacitor plates.\n2.  The conductivity of the plates is infinite, so there is no potential drop across them.\n3.  Fringing effects at the edges of the capacitor are negligible.\n\nThis physical system can be modeled as an equivalent electrical circuit. Each dielectric layer acts as a resistor ($R_i = h_i / (\\sigma_i A)$) in parallel with a capacitor ($C_i = \\varepsilon_i A / h_i$). The two resulting R-C parallel blocks are connected in series across the voltage source $U_0$. While we will solve the problem using fundamental electromagnetic field equations, this circuit model provides a useful physical intuition for the initial and final states of the system.\n\n### Step 1: Fundamental Physical Laws\nWe establish the fundamental equations governing the electromagnetic fields and charges within the capacitor. These equations are derived from Maxwell's equations and material relations.\n\n1.  **Voltage Relation**: The total potential drop across the two dielectrics is equal to the applied voltage $U_0$. This is an application of Kirchhoff's voltage law for a closed loop including the source.\n    \\[\\boxed{U_0 = \\int_0^{h_1+h_2} \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{l}}\\]\n    Given our assumption of uniform fields, this simplifies to:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    E_1(t) h_1 + E_2(t) h_2 = U_0 \\label{eq:volt} \\tag{1}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n2.  **Gauss's Law at the Interface**: The discontinuity in the electric displacement field ($\\vec{D} = \\varepsilon \\vec{E}$) at the interface is equal to the free surface charge density $\\sigma_f$.\n    \\[\\boxed{\\hat{n} \\cdot (\\vec{D}_2 - \\vec{D}_1) = \\sigma_f}\\]\n    With fields perpendicular to the interface (let the direction from material 1 to 2 be positive), this becomes:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\varepsilon_2 E_2(t) - \\varepsilon_1 E_1(t) = \\sigma_f(t) \\label{eq:gauss} \\tag{2}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n3.  **Charge Conservation at the Interface**: The rate of accumulation of charge at the interface equals the net conduction current flowing into it. This is derived from the continuity equation.\n    \\[\\boxed{\\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dt} = \\hat{n} \\cdot (\\vec{j}_1 - \\vec{j}_2)}\\]\n    For our one-dimensional case, this is:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\frac{d\\sigma_f(t)}{dt} = j_1(t) - j_2(t) \\label{eq:continuity} \\tag{3}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n4.  **Ohm's Law**: The conduction current density in each material is proportional to the electric field.\n    \\[\\boxed{\\vec{j} = \\sigma \\vec{E}}\\]\n    This gives us the relations for each material:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    j_1(t) = \\sigma_1 E_1(t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad j_2(t) = \\sigma_2 E_2(t) \\label{eq:ohm} \\tag{4}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the Differential Equation for Interface Charge\nWe combine the equations from Step 1 to obtain a single differential equation for the interface charge density $\\sigma_f(t)$. First, we express the electric fields $E_1$ and $E_2$ in terms of $\\sigma_f$ and $U_0$ by solving the linear system formed by Eq. \\eqref{eq:volt} and \\eqref{eq:gauss}.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\text{From \\eqref{eq:volt}:} \\quad E_2 &= \\frac{U_0 - E_1 h_1}{h_2} \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\text{Substitute into \\eqref{eq:gauss}:} \\quad \\varepsilon_2 \\left(\\frac{U_0 - E_1 h_1}{h_2}\\right) - \\varepsilon_1 E_1 &= \\sigma_f \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\varepsilon_2 U_0 - \\varepsilon_2 h_1 E_1 - \\varepsilon_1 h_2 E_1 &= h_2 \\sigma_f \\nonumber \\\\\n    (\\varepsilon_1 h_2 + \\varepsilon_2 h_1) E_1 &= \\varepsilon_2 U_0 - h_2 \\sigma_f \\nonumber \\\\\n    E_1(t) &= \\frac{\\varepsilon_2 U_0 - h_2 \\sigma_f(t)}{h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1} \\label{eq:E1} \\tag{5} \\\\\n    \\text{Similarly, solving for } E_2(t): \\quad E_2(t) &= \\frac{\\varepsilon_1 U_0 + h_1 \\sigma_f(t)}{h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1} \\label{eq:E2} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we substitute these expressions for $E_1$ and $E_2$ into the charge conservation equation \\eqref{eq:continuity}, using Ohm's law \\eqref{eq:ohm}.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dt} &= \\sigma_1 E_1 - \\sigma_2 E_2 \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= \\sigma_1 \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_2 U_0 - h_2 \\sigma_f}{h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1}\\right) - \\sigma_2 \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_1 U_0 + h_1 \\sigma_f}{h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= \\frac{(\\sigma_1 \\varepsilon_2 - \\sigma_2 \\varepsilon_1)U_0 - (\\sigma_1 h_2 + \\sigma_2 h_1)\\sigma_f}{h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1} \\label{eq:pre_de} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nRearranging this expression yields a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $\\sigma_f(t)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dt} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_1 h_2 + \\sigma_2 h_1}{h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1}\\right) \\sigma_f = \\frac{\\sigma_1 \\varepsilon_2 - \\sigma_2 \\varepsilon_1}{h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1} U_0 \\label{eq:de_sigma} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving for the Interface Charge Density $\\sigma_f(t)$\nThe differential equation \\eqref{eq:de_sigma} is of the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + P y = Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are constants.\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{For } \\frac{dy}{dt} + Py = Q, \\text{ the general solution is } y(t) = \\frac{Q}{P} + C e^{-Pt}}\\]\nThe initial condition is that the capacitor is uncharged at $t=0$, which implies there is no initial charge at the interface.\n\\[\\boxed{\\sigma_f(t=0) = 0}\\]\nFrom Eq. \\eqref{eq:de_sigma}, we identify the relaxation time constant $\\tau = 1/P$ and the steady-state charge density $\\sigma_{f,\\infty} = Q/P$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\tau &= \\frac{h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1}{\\sigma_1 h_2 + \\sigma_2 h_1} \\label{eq:tau} \\tag{9} \\\\\n    \\sigma_{f,\\infty} &= \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\sigma_f(t) = \\frac{(\\sigma_1 \\varepsilon_2 - \\sigma_2 \\varepsilon_1)U_0 / (h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1)}{(\\sigma_1 h_2 + \\sigma_2 h_1) / (h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1)} = \\frac{(\\sigma_1 \\varepsilon_2 - \\sigma_2 \\varepsilon_1)U_0}{\\sigma_1 h_2 + \\sigma_2 h_1} \\label{eq:sigma_inf} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe general solution for the interface charge density is $\\sigma_f(t) = \\sigma_{f,\\infty} + C e^{-t/\\tau}$. We apply the initial condition $\\sigma_f(0)=0$ to find the integration constant $C$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\sigma_f(0) = \\sigma_{f,\\infty} + C e^{0} = 0 \\implies C = -\\sigma_{f,\\infty} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTherefore, the time-dependent interface charge density is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\sigma_f(t) = \\sigma_{f,\\infty} (1 - e^{-t/\\tau}) = \\frac{(\\sigma_1 \\varepsilon_2 - \\sigma_2 \\varepsilon_1)U_0}{\\sigma_1 h_2 + \\sigma_2 h_1} \\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau}\\right) \\label{eq:sigma_t} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Derivation of the Total Current I(t)\nThe total current density, $\\vec{j}_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the conduction current density and the displacement current density. It must be uniform throughout the device due to charge conservation.\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{j}_{\\text{total}} = \\vec{j}_{\\text{cond}} + \\frac{\\partial \\vec{D}}{\\partial t} = \\sigma \\vec{E} + \\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}}\\]\nThe total current $I(t)$ is the total current density multiplied by the area $A$. We can calculate it using the fields in either material. Let's use material 1.\n\\[\\boxed{I(t) = A j_{\\text{total},1} = A \\left(\\sigma_1 E_1(t) + \\varepsilon_1 \\frac{dE_1(t)}{dt}\\right)}\\]\nSince $\\sigma_f(t)$ relaxes to its final value exponentially with time constant $\\tau$, so does $E_1(t)$. We can write $E_1(t) = E_{1,\\infty} + (E_{1,0} - E_{1,\\infty})e^{-t/\\tau}$. Substituting this into the current equation gives $I(t) = I_\\infty + I_{\\text{transient}}(t)$, where $I_\\infty$ is the steady-state current and $I_{\\text{transient}}(t)$ decays with time constant $\\tau$.\n\nFirst, we find the steady-state current $I_\\infty$. As $t \\to \\infty$, all time derivatives vanish, so $I_\\infty = A \\sigma_1 E_{1,\\infty}$.

The cube starts from rest and accumulates snow as it moves.\n\nThe physical situation is defined by the following elements:\n*   **The Cube:** An object of mass `M` and side length `r`.\n*   **The Valley:** A cycloidal path, with the y-axis pointing downwards. The path of the cube's center of mass is described by the parametric equations:\n    $$\n    \\left\\{{\\begin{array}{l}{x=R(\\theta-\\sin\\theta)}\\\\ {y=R(1-\\cos\\theta)}\\end{array}}\\right.\n    $$\n    *   `R` is the radius of the generating circle of the cycloid.\n    *   `\\theta` is the parameter describing the position along the path.\n    *   `y` represents the vertical drop from the starting height. The initial position is at `\\theta=0`, corresponding to `(x,y)=(0,0)`.\n*   **The Snow:** A layer of snow with a uniform surface density `\\sigma` (mass per unit area) covers the valley. As the cube slides, it collects a strip of snow of width `r`.\n*   **The Process:** The cube is released from rest at `\\theta=0`. It slides down into the valley and up the other side, continuously accumulating mass through perfectly inelastic collisions with the stationary snow. We need to find the final vertical position `y_f` where the cube momentarily stops.\n*   **Assumptions and Approximations:**\n    1.  The cube slides without rolling.\n    2.  The accumulated snow adheres to the cube but does not alter its effective shape or size `r` for the purpose of collecting more snow.\n    3.  The total mass of the collected snow is much smaller than the cube's mass. This is formally stated by the condition `\\sigma r R \\ll M`, which implies that `\\epsilon = (\\sigma r R)/M` is a small dimensionless parameter. All results will be calculated to the first order in this parameter.\n    4.  The cube's size is much smaller than the valley's characteristic dimension, `r \\ll R`. This justifies treating the cube as a point mass for its trajectory and kinematics.\n    5.  The gravitational acceleration `g` is constant.\n\n### Step 1: Arc Length of the Cycloidal Path\nTo determine the mass of snow collected, we need the arc length `s` of the path. The differential arc length `ds` for a curve defined by parametric equations `x(\\theta)` and `y(\\theta)` is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{ds = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{d\\theta}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{d\\theta}\\right)^2} d\\theta}\n\\]\n**Derivation:**\nFirst, we compute the derivatives of the parametric coordinates with respect to `\\theta`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dx}{d\\theta} &= \\frac{d}{d\\theta} [R(\\theta - \\sin\\theta)] = R(1 - \\cos\\theta) \\label{eq:dxdtheta} \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{d\\theta} &= \\frac{d}{d\\theta} [R(1 - \\cos\\theta)] = R\\sin\\theta \\label{eq:dydtheta}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting these into the arc length formula:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nds &= \\sqrt{[R(1 - \\cos\\theta)]^2 + [R\\sin\\theta]^2} \\, d\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= R \\sqrt{(1 - 2\\cos\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) + \\sin^2\\theta} \\, d\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= R \\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\theta} \\, d\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing the half-angle trigonometric identity `1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nds &= R \\sqrt{4\\sin^2(\\theta/2)} \\, d\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2R\\sin(\\theta/2) \\, d\\theta \\quad (\\text{since } \\sin(\\theta/2) \\ge 0 \\text{ for } \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi])\n\\label{eq:ds}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Zeroth-Order Velocity Approximation\nWe perform a first-order perturbation analysis based on the small parameter `(\\sigma r R)/M`. As a first step, we find the velocity of the cube in the absence of snow (the zeroth-order solution). In this idealized case, mechanical energy is conserved.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Delta E_k + \\Delta U_g = 0}\n\\]\n**Derivation:**\nThe cube starts from rest (`E_{k,i}=0`) at `y=0`. We define the initial potential energy as `U_{g,i}=0`. At a vertical drop `y`, the kinetic energy is `E_k = \\frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2` and the potential energy is `U_g = -Mgy` (since the y-axis points downwards).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2 - 0) + (-Mgy - 0) &= 0 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2 &= Mgy \\nonumber \\\\\nv_0^2 &= 2gy\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expression for `y` from the problem statement, `y = R(1-\\cos\\theta)`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_0^2 = 2gR(1-\\cos\\theta) \\label{eq:v0_sq}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis unperturbed velocity `v_0` will be used to approximate the true velocity `v` when calculating first-order energy loss terms.\n\n### Step 3: Overall Energy Balance for the System\nWe consider the system to be the cube plus all the snow it collects along its entire path. This choice is advantageous because the non-conservative forces associated with the inelastic collisions (the adhesion of snow) are internal to the system. We can then apply the generalized work-energy theorem, which relates the work done by external forces to the change in the total energy of the system.\n\\[\n\\boxed{W_{\\text{ext}} = \\Delta E_k + \\Delta E_p + \\Delta E_{\\text{th}}}\n\\]\n**Derivation:**\nIn this problem:\n*   The external forces are gravity and the normal force. The work done by gravity is accounted for by the change in potential energy `\\Delta E_p`. The normal force is always perpendicular to the displacement, so it does no work. Thus, `W_{\\text{ext}} = 0`.\n*   The system starts from rest and ends at rest, so the net change in kinetic energy is `\\Delta E_k = 0`.\n*   `\\Delta E_p` is the total change in gravitational potential energy of the cube and all the collected snow.\n*   `\\Delta E_{\\text{th}}` is the thermal energy generated due to the perfectly inelastic collisions between the cube and the snow.\n\nThe energy balance equation for the entire process from the initial state (rest at `y=0`) to the final state (rest at `y=y_f`) simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n0 = 0 + \\Delta E_p + \\Delta E_{\\text{th}} \\implies \\Delta E_p + \\Delta E_{\\text{th}} = 0 \\label{eq:energy_balance}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Change in Gravitational Potential Energy (`\\Delta E_p`)\nThe total change in potential energy is the sum of the changes for the cube and for the snow. The gravitational potential energy of a mass `m` at a vertical position `y` (with the y-axis pointing downwards) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{U_g = -mgy}\n\\]\n**Derivation:**\nThe total change in potential energy is `\\Delta E_p = \\Delta E_{p, \\text{cube}} + \\Delta E_{p, \\text{snow}}`.\nFor the cube:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta E_{p, \\text{cube}} &= U_{g, \\text{cube, final}} - U_{g, \\text{cube, initial}} = -Mgy_f - (-Mg \\cdot 0) = -Mgy_f \\label{eq:dEp_cube}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor the snow, an infinitesimal mass element `dm = \\sigma r ds` is initially at rest at position `y(s)`. At the end of the process, this mass is part of the cube-snow conglomerate at the final height `y_f`. The change in its potential energy is `d(\\Delta E_{p, \\text{snow}}) = -gy_f dm - (-gy(s) dm)`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta E_{p, \\text{snow}} &= \\int_0^{s_f} g(y(s) - y_f) dm = g\\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds - g y_f \\int_0^{s_f} \\sigma r ds \\nonumber \\\\\n&= g\\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds - g y_f m_{\\text{snow, total}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe are solving for `y_f` to first order in the small parameter `\\epsilon = (\\sigma r R)/M`. The term `g\\sigma r \\int y ds` is of order `g \\sigma r R^2`. The term `g y_f m_{\\text{snow, total}}` is of order `g y_f (\\sigma r R)`. Since the energy loss is a first-order effect, `y_f` will be proportional to `\\epsilon`. Thus, the term `g y_f m_{\\text{snow, total}}` is of order `g ((\\sigma r R^2)/M) (\\sigma r R) = g(\\sigma r)^2 R^3/M`. This is smaller than the `g \\sigma r R^2` term by a factor of `\\epsilon`, making it a second-order correction. We can therefore neglect it.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta E_{p, \\text{snow}} \\approx g\\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds \\label{eq:dEp_snow}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nCombining the terms for the cube and snow:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta E_p \\approx -Mgy_f + g\\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds \\label{eq:dEp_total}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Dissipated Thermal Energy (`\\Delta E_{\\text{th}}`)\nThermal energy is generated during the continuous series of perfectly inelastic collisions. The energy dissipated in a perfectly inelastic collision between a moving mass `m_1` and a stationary mass `m_2` is equal to the loss of kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame, which is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{dE_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v_{\\text{rel}}^2}\n\\]\nwhere `\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2}` is the reduced mass and `v_{\\text{rel}}` is the relative velocity.\n**Derivation:**\nHere, `m_1 = m(s)` is the current mass of the cube plus snow, `m_2 = dm = \\sigma r ds` is the infinitesimal mass of the snow element being collected, and `v_{\\text{rel}} = v(s)` is the velocity of the cube relative to the stationary snow.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ndE_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m(s) \\cdot dm}{m(s)+dm}v(s)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} dm \\, v(s)^2 \\left( \\frac{m(s)}{m(s)+dm} \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince `dm \\ll m(s) \\approx M`, the correction factor `\\frac{m(s)}{m(s)+dm} = \\frac{1}{1+dm/m(s)} \\approx 1 - \\frac{dm}{m(s)}`. The error introduced by approximating this factor as 1 is of order `dm/M`. This leads to a second-order correction in the total dissipated energy, which can be neglected in a first-order calculation.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ndE_{\\text{th}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} dm \\, v(s)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma r ds) v(s)^2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe total thermal energy dissipated over the entire path from the start to the final position `s_f` is the integral of this expression.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta E_{\\text{th}} = \\int_0^{s_f} dE_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} v(s)^2 ds \\label{eq:dEth_total}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Combining Terms and Solving for the Final Height\nWe now substitute the expressions for `\\Delta E_p` (Eq. \\ref{eq:dEp_total}) and `\\Delta E_{\\text{th}}` (Eq. \\ref{eq:dEth_total}) into the energy balance equation from Step 3.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Delta E_p + \\Delta E_{\\text{th}} = 0}\n\\]\n**Derivation:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(-Mgy_f + g\\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} v(s)^2 ds\\right) \\approx 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSolving for `Mgy_f`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nMgy_f \\approx g\\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} v(s)^2 ds \\label{eq:mgyf_s}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe integrals are already multiplied by the small quantity `\\sigma r`, so to obtain a first-order result for `y_f`, we can use the zeroth-order approximation for the integrands. The true velocity squared `v(s)^2` can be replaced by the unperturbed velocity squared `v_0(s)^2 = 2gy(s)`. The error introduced, `v_0^2 - v^2`, is of first order in `\\sigma r`, so its contribution to the integral results in a second-order error in `y_f`, which is negligible.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nMgy_f &\\approx g\\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} (2gy(s)) ds \\nonumber \\\\\n&= g\\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds + g\\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2 g \\sigma r \\int_0^{s_f} y(s) ds\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince the energy loss is small, the cube almost reaches the same height on the other side, so the final parameter `\\theta_f` is close to `2\\pi`. We can approximate the upper limit of the integral `s_f` by the path length of a full arch, `s(2\\pi)`. This is valid because the integrand is already of first order in `\\sigma r`, so corrections to the integration limit only introduce second-order errors to `y_f`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nMgy_f &\\approx 2 g \\sigma r \\int_0^{2\\pi} y(\\theta) \\frac{ds}{d\\theta} d\\theta\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFinally, solving for `y_f`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ny_f \\approx \\frac{2 \\sigma r}{M} \\int_0^{2\\pi} y(\\theta) \\frac{ds}{d\\theta} d\\theta \\label{eq:yf_integral_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Evaluating the Path Integral\nThe final step is to compute the definite integral `\\int_0^{2\\pi} y(\\theta) \\frac{ds}{d\\theta} d\\theta`.\n**Derivation:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} y(\\theta) \\frac{ds}{d\\theta} d\\theta &= \\int_0^{2\\pi} [R(1-\\cos\\theta)] [2R\\sin(\\theta/2)] d\\theta \\quad (\\text{using Eq. \\ref{eq:ds}}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2R^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} (1-\\cos\\theta)\\sin(\\theta/2) d\\theta \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2R^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} [2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)]\\sin(\\theta/2) d\\theta \\quad (\\text{using } 1-\\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 4R^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^3(\\theta/2) d\\theta\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLet `u = \\theta/2`, so `d\\theta = 2du`.

This symmetry implies that the refractive index $n$ is a function only of the radial distance $r$ from the origin. We are given that a light ray propagating in this medium follows a specific trajectory described in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ by the equation $r = a\\cos(q\\theta)$. This trajectory is defined for the region where the radial distance $r$ is less than or equal to a constant $a$. The problem asks for the functional form of $n(r)$.\n\nThe variables and constants involved are:\n*   $r, \\theta$: The polar coordinates describing the position of the light ray.\n*   $n(r)$: The refractive index of the medium, which is a function of $r$.\n*   $a$: A positive constant with dimensions of length, representing the maximum radial extent of the trajectory.\n*   $q$: A dimensionless constant that characterizes the shape of the trajectory.\n\nWe are also informed that scaling the refractive index by a constant factor does not alter the light's path. Consequently, the solution for $n(r)$ is unique only up to a multiplicative constant. This ambiguity should be resolved by including a dimensionless coefficient, denoted as $n_0$, in the final expression. The problem statement anticipates that the resulting $n(r)$ might exhibit non-physical behavior, such as a divergence at the origin ($r=0$), which is acceptable for this theoretical problem.\n\n### Step 1: The Optical-Mechanical Analogy\nTo determine the refractive index from the given trajectory, we utilize the optical-mechanical analogy. This analogy stems from the formal equivalence between the principle governing light propagation (Fermat's Principle) and a principle of classical mechanics (Maupertuis' Principle). This allows us to translate the optical problem of finding a refractive index for a given light path into the mechanical problem of finding a potential field for a particle following an equivalent trajectory.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nThe path of a light ray is determined by Fermat's Principle, which states that the optical path length between two points is an extremum.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\delta \\int n \\, ds = 0}\n\\]\nHere, $n$ is the refractive index and $ds$ is an element of arc length along the path.\n\nThe trajectory of a classical particle with a fixed total energy is governed by Maupertuis' Principle (a form of the Principle of Least Action), which states that the abbreviated action is an extremum.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\delta \\int p \\, ds = 0}\n\\]\nHere, $p$ is the magnitude of the particle's momentum.\n\n**Derivation**\nComparing the mathematical forms of Fermat's Principle and Maupertuis' Principle reveals a direct analogy. The two variational principles become identical if we identify the refractive index $n(r)$ as being proportional to the momentum $p(r)$ of an analogous particle. For a non-relativistic particle of mass $m$ and total energy $E$ moving in a potential $V(r)$, the momentum is given by $p = \\sqrt{2m(E - V(r))}$. This leads to the central relationship of the optical-mechanical analogy:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn(r) = C \\sqrt{E - V(r)} \\label{eq:analogy} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality. Our strategy is to first find the potential energy function $V(r)$ that would cause a classical particle to follow the given trajectory $r = a\\cos(q\\theta)$, and then use Eq. \\eqref{eq:analogy} to determine the refractive index $n(r)$.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the Equivalent Potential Energy\nWe now determine the potential energy function $V(r)$ for a particle of mass $m$ that results in the trajectory $r(\\theta) = a\\cos(q\\theta)$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nFor a particle moving in a central potential $V(r)$, its total energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$ are conserved quantities.\nThe total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies, expressed in polar coordinates as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{E = T + V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\theta}^2) + V(r)}\n\\]\nThe magnitude of the angular momentum is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{L = mr^2\\dot{\\theta}}\n\\]\n\n**Derivation**\nFirst, we express the kinetic energy $T$ as a function of the radial coordinate $r$. From the conservation of angular momentum, we have $\\dot{\\theta} = L/(mr^2)$. Using the chain rule, the radial velocity is $\\dot{r} = \\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\frac{L}{mr^2}$. Substituting these into the expression for kinetic energy:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nT &= \\frac{1}{2}m\\left[ \\left(\\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\frac{L}{mr^2}\\right)^2 + r^2\\left(\\frac{L}{mr^2}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}m \\frac{L^2}{m^2r^4} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\right)^2 + r^2 \\right] = \\frac{L^2}{2mr^4} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\right)^2 + r^2 \\right] \\label{eq:T_polar} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor the given trajectory $r(\\theta) = a\\cos(q\\theta)$, the derivative with respect to $\\theta$ is $\\frac{dr}{d\\theta} = -aq\\sin(q\\theta)$. We can express this purely in terms of $r$ by using $\\cos(q\\theta) = r/a$ and the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(q\\theta) = 1 - \\cos^2(q\\theta) = 1 - (r/a)^2$.\nSubstituting these into Eq. \\eqref{eq:T_polar}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nT(r) &= \\frac{L^2}{2mr^4} \\left[ (-aq\\sin(q\\theta))^2 + r^2 \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{L^2}{2mr^4} \\left[ a^2q^2\\sin^2(q\\theta) + r^2 \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{L^2}{2mr^4} \\left[ a^2q^2\\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right) + r^2 \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{L^2}{2mr^4} \\left[ a^2q^2 - q^2r^2 + r^2 \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{L^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{a^2q^2}{r^4} - \\frac{q^2-1}{r^2} \\right) \\label{eq:T_r} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom the optical-mechanical analogy, $n(r) \\propto \\sqrt{E-V(r)}$. Since $T(r) = E-V(r)$, it follows that $n(r) \\propto \\sqrt{T(r)}$. This shows that the refractive index profile is determined by the kinetic energy function $T(r)$, which in turn is uniquely determined by the trajectory. The total energy $E$ of the analogous mechanical system is an arbitrary constant, as its value only shifts the potential $V(r)$ by a constant amount but does not change the physics. For algebraic simplicity, we can set $E=0$. This choice defines the potential energy to be $V(r) = -T(r)$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV(r) = -T(r) = - \\frac{L^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{a^2q^2}{r^4} - \\frac{q^2-1}{r^2} \\right) = \\frac{L^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{q^2-1}{r^2} - \\frac{a^2q^2}{r^4} \\right) \\label{eq:V_r} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Refractive Index\nHaving found the kinetic energy function $T(r)$ corresponding to the trajectory, we can now determine the refractive index profile $n(r)$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**\nWe use the relationship from the optical-mechanical analogy, which states that the refractive index is proportional to the square root of the kinetic energy of the analogous particle.\n\\[\n\\boxed{n(r) \\propto \\sqrt{T(r)}}\n\\]\nThis is equivalent to $n(r) = C \\sqrt{E - V(r)}$ from Step 1, with $E-V(r)=T(r)$.\n\n**Derivation**\nLet the proportionality constant be $K'$, so $n(r) = K' \\sqrt{T(r)}$. Substituting the expression for $T(r)$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:T_r}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn(r) &= K' \\sqrt{\\frac{L^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{a^2q^2}{r^4} - \\frac{q^2-1}{r^2} \\right)} = \\left(K' \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2m}}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2q^2}{r^4} - \\frac{q^2-1}{r^2}} \\label{eq:n_intermediate} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe constants $K'$, $L$, and $m$ are parameters of the analogous mechanical system. We can combine them into a single constant $K = K' \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2m}}$. The term under the square root has dimensions of $[L]^{-2}$, so its square root has dimensions of $[L]^{-1}$. Since $n(r)$ must be dimensionless, the constant $K$ must have dimensions of length, $[L]$.\n\nTo satisfy the problem's requirement for a dimensionless constant $n_0$, we define $K$ in terms of the characteristic length $a$ and $n_0$ by setting $K = n_0 a$. This definition allows us to give $n_0$ a clear physical interpretation. Let's evaluate $n(r)$ at the boundary $r=a$:\n$n(a) = n_0 a \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2q^2}{a^4} - \\frac{q^2-1}{a^2}} = n_0 a \\sqrt{\\frac{q^2 - (q^2-1)}{a^2}} = n_0 a \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a^2}} = n_0$.\nThus, our choice of constant implies that $n_0$ is the refractive index at the radial distance $r=a$. Substituting $K = n_0 a$ into our expression for $n(r)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn(r) = n_0 a \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2q^2}{r^4} - \\frac{q^2-1}{r^2}} \\label{eq:n_final_derivation} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor the refractive index $n(r)$ to be a real number, the argument of the square root (the radicand) must be non-negative for all $r$ on the trajectory ($0 < r \\le a$). The radicand is $\\frac{a^2q^2 - (q^2-1)r^2}{r^4}$. We must check if $a^2q^2 - (q^2-1)r^2 \\ge 0$.\n*   **Case 1: $q^2 - 1 \\ge 0$ (i.e., $|q| \\ge 1$)**. In this case, $q^2-1$ is non-negative. Since $r^2 \\le a^2$, we have $(q^2-1)r^2 \\le (q^2-1)a^2$. Therefore, $a^2q^2 - (q^2-1)r^2 \\ge a^2q^2 - (q^2-1)a^2 = a^2(q^2 - q^2 + 1) = a^2$. Since $a^2 > 0$, the radicand is always positive.\n*   **Case 2: $q^2 - 1 < 0$ (i.e., $|q| < 1$)**. In this case, $q^2-1$ is negative. Let $q^2-1 = -k$ where $k>0$. The expression becomes $a^2q^2 - (-k)r^2 = a^2q^2 + kr^2$. Since $a^2q^2 \\ge 0$ and $kr^2 > 0$ for $r>0$, their sum is positive.\nIn both cases, the condition is satisfied, so the expression for $n(r)$ is real-valued for all points on the trajectory where $r>0$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe refractive index distribution $n(r)$ that produces the light trajectory $r=a\\cos(q\\theta)$ in the region $r \\le a$ is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{n(r) = n_0 a \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2q^2}{r^4} - \\frac{q^2-1}{r^2}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere $n_0$ is a dimensionless constant representing the refractive index at the boundary $r=a$."}

The stone is modeled as a solid homogeneous cylinder with mass $m$, height $h$, and a bottom radius $r$. It moves on a horizontal ice surface with a coefficient of kinetic friction $\\mu$.\n\nThe key physical parameters and conditions are:\n*   **Object Geometry**: A solid homogeneous cylinder. Its center of mass (CM) is located at a height $h/2$ from the base.\n*   **Contact with Ice**: The stone is supported only by the thin outer circular edge (rim) of its bottom surface, which has a radius $r$.\n*   **Coordinate System**: We establish a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system $(x, y, z)$. The origin $(0,0,0)$ is at the center of the stone's bottom circular rim. The xy-plane represents the ice surface, and the z-axis points vertically upwards. A polar coordinate $\\theta$ is used to denote position on the rim, measured from the positive x-axis.\n*   **Motion**:\n    *   The stone's center of mass has a translational velocity $\\vec{v} = v \\hat{i}$ along the positive x-axis.\n    *   The stone rotates with an angular velocity $\\vec{\\omega} = -\\omega \\hat{k}$, corresponding to a clockwise rotation when viewed from above.\n*   **Forces**:\n    *   **Gravitational Force**: $\\vec{F}_g = -mg\\hat{k}$, acting downwards through the CM.\n    *   **Normal Force**: The ice exerts an upward support force on the bottom rim. This force is distributed along the rim and is described by a linear density $n(\\theta)$ (force per unit angle). The total normal force is $N = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} n(\\theta) d\\theta$.\n    *   **Frictional Force**: A kinetic friction force acts on each point of the rim, opposing the local velocity of the rim relative to the ice.\n*   **Given Distribution Form**: The problem states that the normal force distribution takes the form $n(\\theta) = n_0 + n_1\\cos(\\theta - \\theta_0)$. This non-uniform distribution arises from the slight tilting of the stone due to the torque from friction, which causes a non-uniform elastic deformation of the rim. The parameters $n_0$, $n_1$, and $\\theta_0$ are determined by the dynamics of the motion.\n*   **Objective**: Find the expression for the stone's lateral acceleration, $a_y$, in the y-direction.\n*   **Limiting Condition**: The calculation is to be performed in the limit where the translational speed is much greater than the rotational speed at the rim, i.e., $v \\gg \\omega r$.\n*   **Assumption**: The stone slides without tumbling. This implies that the net torque about the center of mass in the horizontal (x and y) directions is zero, which maintains the stone's orientation in a quasi-static equilibrium.\n\n### Step 1: Kinematics of a Point on the Rim\nTo calculate the friction force, we first need the velocity of any point on the rim relative to the stationary ice. The velocity of a point on a rigid body is the sum of the translational velocity of a reference point and the velocity due to rotation about that reference point. We choose the center of the bottom rim (the origin) as our reference point.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{v}_{P} = \\vec{v}_{\\text{ref}} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{P/\\text{ref}}}\n\\]\nHere, $\\vec{v}_{P}$ is the velocity of a point $P$ on the rim, $\\vec{v}_{\\text{ref}}$ is the velocity of our reference point (the origin), which is the translational velocity of the stone, $\\vec{v} = v\\hat{i}$. The vector $\\vec{p} = \\vec{r}_{P/\\text{ref}}$ is the position vector of point $P$ relative to the origin. The velocity of point $P$ relative to the ice is $\\vec{v}_{rel} = \\vec{v}_P$.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{p} &= r\\cos\\theta \\hat{i} + r\\sin\\theta \\hat{j} \\label{eq:pos_p} \\\\\n\\vec{v}_{rel}(\\theta) &= \\vec{v} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{p} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= v\\hat{i} + (-\\omega\\hat{k}) \\times (r\\cos\\theta \\hat{i} + r\\sin\\theta \\hat{j}) \\label{eq:v_rel_start} \\\\\n&= v\\hat{i} - \\omega r \\cos\\theta (\\hat{k} \\times \\hat{i}) - \\omega r \\sin\\theta (\\hat{k} \\times \\hat{j}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= v\\hat{i} - \\omega r \\cos\\theta (\\hat{j}) - \\omega r \\sin\\theta (-\\hat{i}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (v + \\omega r \\sin\\theta)\\hat{i} - (\\omega r \\cos\\theta)\\hat{j} \\label{eq:v_rel_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Frictional Force Analysis\nThe kinetic friction force $d\\vec{f}$ on a small segment of the rim of angular width $d\\theta$ opposes the relative velocity $\\vec{v}_{rel}$ and its magnitude is proportional to the elemental normal force $dN = n(\\theta)d\\theta$.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{d\\vec{f} = -\\mu \\, dN \\, \\frac{\\vec{v}_{rel}}{|\\vec{v}_{rel}|} = -\\mu n(\\theta) d\\theta \\, \\frac{\\vec{v}_{rel}}{|\\vec{v}_{rel}|}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{(1+x)^k \\approx 1+kx \\text{ for } |x| \\ll 1 \\quad (\\text{Binomial Approximation})}\n\\]\nFirst, we find the magnitude of the relative velocity and approximate it for the limit $v \\gg \\omega r$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|\\vec{v}_{rel}| &= \\sqrt{(v + \\omega r \\sin\\theta)^2 + (-\\omega r \\cos\\theta)^2} = \\sqrt{v^2 + 2v\\omega r \\sin\\theta + \\omega^2 r^2 \\sin^2\\theta + \\omega^2 r^2 \\cos^2\\theta} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{v^2 + 2v\\omega r \\sin\\theta + \\omega^2 r^2} \\label{eq:v_rel_mag} \\\\\n&= v \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\omega r}{v}\\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\omega r}{v}\\right)^2} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn the limit $v \\gg \\omega r$, the term $\\epsilon = \\frac{\\omega r}{v}$ is small. Using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^{1/2} \\approx 1+x/2$ and keeping only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|\\vec{v}_{rel}| \\approx v \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2\\omega r}{v}\\sin\\theta\\right)\\right) = v + \\omega r \\sin\\theta \\label{eq:v_rel_mag_approx}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we find the components of the friction force per unit angle, $\\vec{f}(\\theta) = d\\vec{f}/d\\theta$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_x(\\theta) &= -\\mu n(\\theta) \\frac{v_{rel,x}}{|\\vec{v}_{rel}|} \\approx -\\mu n(\\theta) \\frac{v + \\omega r \\sin\\theta}{v + \\omega r \\sin\\theta} = -\\mu n(\\theta) \\label{eq:fx_approx} \\\\\nf_y(\\theta) &= -\\mu n(\\theta) \\frac{v_{rel,y}}{|\\vec{v}_{rel}|} \\approx -\\mu n(\\theta) \\frac{-\\omega r \\cos\\theta}{v + \\omega r \\sin\\theta} = \\frac{\\mu \\omega r \\cos\\theta \\, n(\\theta)}{v(1 + \\frac{\\omega r}{v}\\sin\\theta)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{\\mu \\omega r \\cos\\theta \\, n(\\theta)}{v} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega r}{v}\\sin\\theta\\right) \\quad (\\text{using } (1+x)^{-1} \\approx 1-x) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mu \\omega r}{v} n(\\theta) \\cos\\theta - \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\omega r}{v}\\right)^2\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{\\mu \\omega r}{v} n(\\theta) \\cos\\theta \\label{eq:fy_approx}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn the last step for $f_y(\\theta)$, we kept only the leading term, which is of order $\\omega r/v$.\n\n### Step 3: Torque Balance about the Center of Mass\nThe assumption of no tumbling means the net torque about the stone's center of mass (CM), located at $(0, 0, h/2)$, must be zero in the horizontal directions. The forces creating torques are the distributed normal force and the distributed friction force, both acting on the bottom rim ($z=0$).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\vec{\\tau}_{net, CM} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\vec{r}_{app} \\times d\\vec{N} + \\vec{r}_{app} \\times d\\vec{f}) = \\vec{0}}\n\\]\nThe lever arm from the CM to a point $P$ on the rim is $\\vec{r}_{app} = \\vec{p} - (h/2)\\hat{k} = r\\cos\\theta\\hat{i} + r\\sin\\theta\\hat{j} - (h/2)\\hat{k}$.\nThe torque from the normal force element $d\\vec{N} = n(\\theta)d\\theta \\hat{k}$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nd\\vec{\\tau}_N &= \\vec{r}_{app} \\times d\\vec{N} = (r\\cos\\theta\\hat{i} + r\\sin\\theta\\hat{j} - \\frac{h}{2}\\hat{k}) \\times (n(\\theta)d\\theta \\hat{k}) \\\\\n&= (r n(\\theta) \\sin\\theta d\\theta) \\hat{i} - (r n(\\theta) \\cos\\theta d\\theta) \\hat{j}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe torque from the friction force element $d\\vec{f} = (f_x(\\theta)\\hat{i} + f_y(\\theta)\\hat{j})d\\theta$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nd\\vec{\\tau}_f &= \\vec{r}_{app} \\times d\\vec{f} = (r\\cos\\theta\\hat{i} + r\\sin\\theta\\hat{j} - \\frac{h}{2}\\hat{k}) \\times (f_x(\\theta)\\hat{i} + f_y(\\theta)\\hat{j})d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{h}{2}f_y(\\theta)d\\theta\\right)\\hat{i} - \\left(\\frac{h}{2}f_x(\\theta)d\\theta\\right)\\hat{j} + (r\\cos\\theta f_y(\\theta) - r\\sin\\theta f_x(\\theta))d\\theta \\hat{k}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSetting the x and y components of the total torque to zero gives two balance equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_x &= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left(r n(\\theta) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{h}{2}f_y(\\theta)\\right) d\\theta = 0 \\label{eq:torque_x} \\\\\n\\tau_y &= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left(-r n(\\theta) \\cos\\theta - \\frac{h}{2}f_x(\\theta)\\right) d\\theta = 0 \\label{eq:torque_y}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Normal Force Distribution\nWe use the given form $n(\\theta) = n_0 + n_1\\cos(\\theta-\\theta_0)$. For easier integration, we expand it as $n(\\theta) = n_0 + a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta$, where $a=n_1\\cos\\theta_0$ and $b=n_1\\sin\\theta_0$.

The analysis will be conducted by balancing the forces in the spaceship's own inertial reference frame.\n\nWe are given two inertial reference frames:\n1.  The Earth's frame, which we will denote as $\\Sigma$.\n2.  The spaceship's rest frame, which we will denote as $\\Sigma'$.\n\nThe physical quantities, constants, and variables are defined as follows:\n*   **In the Earth frame ($\\Sigma$):**\n    *   The spaceship moves at a constant velocity $v_1$.\n    *   The cosmic dust particles move in the same direction as the spaceship with a velocity $v_2$.\n    *   The number density of dust particles (number of particles per unit volume) is $n$.\n*   **In the spaceship frame ($\\Sigma'$):**\n    *   The spaceship is stationary.\n    *   Photons are emitted backward with a frequency $u_0$.\n    *   The collision between a dust particle and the spaceship is described as \"perfectly elastic\". Since the spaceship's velocity is maintained by the photon drive, it acts as a fixed object of infinite effective mass in the collision. In a one-dimensional collision, this means the dust particle's kinetic energy and speed are conserved, and its velocity is reversed.\n    *   The number of photons emitted backward per unit time is $N'$, which is the quantity we need to determine.\n*   **Properties of the spaceship and dust:**\n    *   Rest mass of the spaceship: $M$. (This information is not required for the final calculation as we are maintaining constant velocity, not accelerating).\n    *   Rest mass of a dust particle: $m$.\n    *   Area of the spaceship's front surface: $S$.\n*   **Physical constants:**\n    *   Planck's constant: $h$.\n    *   Speed of light in vacuum: $c$.\n\nWe will use the standard relativistic notation:\n*   $\\beta_1 = v_1/c$ and the corresponding Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = (1 - \\beta_1^2)^{-1/2}$.\n*   $\\beta_2 = v_2/c$ and the corresponding Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = (1 - \\beta_2^2)^{-1/2}$.\n*   Quantities measured in the spaceship frame $\\Sigma'$ are denoted with a prime (e.g., $v_2'$, $n'$).\n\nThe problem will be solved by calculating the drag force exerted by the dust on the spaceship and equating it to the thrust provided by the photon emission, thereby ensuring the net force on the spaceship is zero in its own frame.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Dust Properties in the Spaceship's Frame\nTo analyze the collisions in the spaceship's frame $\\Sigma'$, we must first determine the velocity ($v_2'$) and number density ($n'$) of the cosmic dust as measured by an observer on the spaceship.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nFor two frames $\\Sigma$ and $\\Sigma'$ where $\\Sigma'$ moves with velocity $u$ relative to $\\Sigma$ along a common x-axis, the velocity $v$ of an object in $\\Sigma$ transforms to $v'$ in $\\Sigma'$ according to the relativistic velocity transformation formula:\n\\[\\boxed{\nv' = \\frac{v-u}{1 - \\frac{vu}{c^2}}\n}\\]\nThe number density $n$ of a group of particles moving with velocity $v$ is related to their proper number density $n_0$ (the density in their own rest frame) by the Lorentz contraction effect:\n\\[\\boxed{\nn = \\gamma n_0 \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nFirst, we find the velocity of a dust particle, $v_2'$, in the spaceship's frame $\\Sigma'$. The spaceship frame $\\Sigma'$ moves with velocity $u=v_1$ relative to the Earth frame $\\Sigma$. The dust particles have velocity $v=v_2$ in $\\Sigma$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_2' = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}\n\\label{eq:v2_prime} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNext, we find the number density $n'$ of the dust in the $\\Sigma'$ frame. Let $n_0$ be the proper number density of the dust particles. In the Earth frame $\\Sigma$, the dust moves at velocity $v_2$, so its observed density is related to its proper density by:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn = \\gamma_2 n_0 \\implies n_0 = \\frac{n}{\\gamma_2}\n\\label{eq:n_earth} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn the spaceship frame $\\Sigma'$, the dust moves at velocity $v_2'$, so its density is given by:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn' = \\gamma_2' n_0\n\\label{eq:n_ship_proper} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere $\\gamma_2' = (1 - (v_2'/c)^2)^{-1/2}$. Substituting eq. \\eqref{eq:n_earth} into eq. \\eqref{eq:n_ship_proper}, we relate the density in the spaceship frame to the density in the Earth frame:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn' = \\frac{\\gamma_2'}{\\gamma_2} n\n\\label{eq:n_prime} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Resistive Force from Cosmic Dust\nThe resistive force (drag) on the spaceship is the total momentum transferred from the colliding dust particles per unit time, as measured in the spaceship's frame $\\Sigma'$.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe relativistic momentum of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is:\n\\[\\boxed{\np = \\gamma m v\n}\\]\nThe force exerted by a stream of particles is the rate of momentum they transfer, which can be calculated as the product of the particle flux and the momentum change per particle:\n\\[\\boxed{\nF = \\frac{dP}{dt} = (\\text{Number of particles colliding per unit time}) \\times (\\text{Momentum change per particle})\n}\\]\nFor a perfectly elastic collision with a stationary object of effectively infinite mass, the incoming particle's kinetic energy is conserved. For a 1D collision, this means its speed is unchanged, and its velocity is reversed.\n\n**Derivation**:\nIn frame $\\Sigma'$, the number of dust particles colliding with the spaceship's front surface $S$ per unit time is the particle flux multiplied by the area:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dN_{\\text{coll}}}{dt'} = n' |v_2'| S\n\\label{eq:flux} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe momentum of a single dust particle before collision in $\\Sigma'$ is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\np_{2, \\text{before}}' = m \\gamma_2' v_2'\n\\label{eq:p_before} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\\]\nAs the collision is perfectly elastic in $\\Sigma'$ and the spaceship is held stationary, the particle's kinetic energy is conserved. This implies its speed $|v_2'|$ is unchanged. The particle's velocity is reversed: $v_{2, \\text{after}}' = -v_2'$. The momentum after collision is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\np_{2, \\text{after}}' = m \\gamma_2' (-v_2') = -p_{2, \\text{before}}'\n\\label{eq:p_after} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe change in momentum of one particle is $\\Delta p_2' = p_{2, \\text{after}}' - p_{2, \\text{before}}' = -2p_{2, \\text{before}}'$. By Newton's third law, the momentum transferred to the spaceship is the negative of this, $\\Delta p_{\\text{ship}}' = -\\Delta p_2' = 2p_{2, \\text{before}}'$. The magnitude of momentum transferred to the ship per collision is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n|\\Delta p_{\\text{ship}}'| = |2p_{2, \\text{before}}'| = 2 m \\gamma_2' |v_2'|\n\\label{eq:dp_ship} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe total resistive force $F'_{\\text{drag}}$ is the product of the particle collision rate and the magnitude of momentum transferred per particle. This force acts as a drag, opposing the spaceship's motion.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF'_{\\text{drag}} &= \\left(\\frac{dN_{\\text{coll}}}{dt'}\\right) |\\Delta p_{\\text{ship}}'| = (n' |v_2'| S) (2 m \\gamma_2' |v_2'|) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2 n' S m \\gamma_2' (v_2')^2\n\\label{eq:F_drag_prime} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Express the Resistive Force in Terms of Earth Frame Quantities\nThe final answer should be in terms of the initial given quantities ($n, v_1, v_2$, etc.), which are defined in the Earth frame $\\Sigma$. We now substitute the expressions for $n'$ and $v_2'$ into the force equation and simplify.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nFrom the relativistic velocity transformation, one can derive the following identity for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma'$ corresponding to the relative velocity $v'$ between an object (velocity $v$) and a frame (velocity $u$):\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\gamma' = \\gamma_u \\gamma_v (1 - \\beta_u \\beta_v)\n}\\]\nHere, $\\gamma'$ corresponds to $v'$, $\\gamma_u$ to the frame velocity $u$, and $\\gamma_v$ to the object velocity $v$.\n\n**Derivation**:\nWe start with the expression for the drag force from eq. \\eqref{eq:F_drag_prime} and substitute $n'$ from eq. \\eqref{eq:n_prime}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF'_{\\text{drag}} = 2 \\left(n \\frac{\\gamma_2'}{\\gamma_2}\\right) S m \\gamma_2' (v_2')^2 = \\frac{2nSm}{\\gamma_2} (\\gamma_2')^2 (v_2')^2\n\\label{eq:F_drag_sub} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow we express the term $(\\gamma_2')^2 (v_2')^2$ using Earth frame quantities. The Lorentz factor for the relative velocity $v_2'$ is $\\gamma_2' = \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 (1 - \\beta_1 \\beta_2)$.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\gamma_2')^2 (v_2')^2 &= \\left( \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 (1 - \\beta_1 \\beta_2) \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} \\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left( \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 (1 - \\beta_1 \\beta_2) \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{c(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)}{1 - \\beta_1 \\beta_2} \\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2^2 (1 - \\beta_1 \\beta_2)^2 \\frac{c^2(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)^2}{(1 - \\beta_1 \\beta_2)^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2^2 c^2 (\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2^2 (v_2 - v_1)^2\n\\label{eq:gamma_v_sq} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting eq. \\eqref{eq:gamma_v_sq} into eq. \\eqref{eq:F_drag_sub}:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF'_{\\text{drag}} &= \\frac{2nSm}{\\gamma_2} \\left( \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2^2 (v_2 - v_1)^2 \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2nSm \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2)^2\n\\label{eq:F_drag_final} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\\]\nNote that we used $(v_2 - v_1)^2 = (v_1 - v_2)^2$ in the final expression.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Propulsive Force and Find N'\nTo maintain a constant velocity, the net force on the spaceship in its own frame $\\Sigma'$ must be zero. The forward propulsive thrust from the emitted photons must exactly balance the backward drag force from the dust.\n\n**Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**:\nThe energy of a photon with frequency $\\nu$ is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\\[\\boxed{\nE = h \\nu\n}\\]\nThe energy-momentum relation for a massless particle (like a photon) is:\n\\[\\boxed{\nE = pc\n}\\]\nFor an object to maintain a constant velocity, the net force acting on it must be zero (Newton's First Law):\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = 0\n}\\]\n\n**Derivation**:\nIn the spaceship frame $\\Sigma'$, each photon is emitted with frequency $u_0$. The energy of one photon is $E' = h u_0$. From the energy-momentum relation, its momentum is $p'_{\\text{photon}} = E'/c = h u_0 / c$.\nThe photons are emitted backward. By conservation of momentum, each photon provides a forward thrust of magnitude $p'_{\\text{photon}}$ to the spaceship. If $N'$ photons are emitted per unit time, the total propulsive force (thrust) is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF'_{\\text{thrust}} = N' p'_{\\text{photon}} = N' \\frac{h u_0}{c}\n\\label{eq:F_thrust} \\tag{13}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo maintain a constant velocity, the magnitude of the thrust must equal the magnitude of the drag force:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF'_{\\text{thrust}} &= F'_{\\text{drag}} \\nonumber \\\\\nN' \\frac{h u_0}{c} &= 2nSm \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2)^2\n\\label{eq:force_balance} \\tag{14}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSolving for the photon emission rate $N'$:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nN' = \\frac{2nSmc \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2)^2}{h u_0}\n\\label{eq:N_final} \\tag{15}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number $N'$ of photons that need to be emitted backward per unit time in the reference frame of the spaceship to maintain its constant speed is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{N' = \\frac{2n S m c\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\gamma_{2}(v_{1}-v_{2})^{2}}{h u_{0}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

We assume the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium and that the principles of thermodynamics are applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Derive an expression for the difference in heat capacities $C_p - C_V$\nWe begin with the general thermodynamic relation for the difference between the heat capacities, which is valid for any simple compressible system.\n\\[\\boxed{C_p - C_V = T \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial T}\\right)_V \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_p}\\]\nTo use this formula, we must compute the two partial derivatives from the given equation of state.\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial T}\\right)_V &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left(k V^{-4/5}T^{3/2}\\right)_V \\nonumber \\\\\n&= k V^{-4/5} \\left(\\frac{3}{2}T^{1/2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{p}{T^{3/2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{2}T^{1/2}\\right) \\quad \\left(\\text{using } k V^{-4/5} = \\frac{p}{T^{3/2}}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{p}{T}\n\\label{eq:dpdT} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, to calculate $\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_p$, we first express $V$ as a function of $p$ and $T$ from the equation of state:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np = k V^{-4/5}T^{3/2} \\implies V^{-4/5} = p k^{-1} T^{-3/2} \\implies V = \\left(p k^{-1} T^{-3/2}\\right)^{-5/4} = p^{-5/4} k^{5/4} T^{15/8}\n\\label{eq:V_of_pT} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we compute the partial derivative of $V$ with respect to $T$ at constant $p$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_p &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left(p^{-5/4} k^{5/4} T^{15/8}\\right)_p \\nonumber \\\\\n&= p^{-5/4} k^{5/4} \\left(\\frac{15}{8}T^{7/8}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{V}{T^{15/8}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{15}{8}T^{7/8}\\right) \\quad \\left(\\text{using eq. \\ref{eq:V_of_pT}}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{15}{8} \\frac{V}{T}\n\\label{eq:dVdT} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expressions for the partial derivatives from eq. \\eqref{eq:dpdT} and eq. \\eqref{eq:dVdT} into the formula for $C_p - C_V$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nC_p - C_V &= T \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{p}{T}\\right) \\left(\\frac{15}{8}\\frac{V}{T}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{45}{16} \\frac{pV}{T}\n\\label{eq:CpCv_final} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Express $C_V$ in terms of V, T, and $\\gamma$\nWe use the definition of the specific heat ratio, $\\gamma$, which is given as a constant.\n\\[\\boxed{\\gamma = \\frac{C_p}{C_V}}\\]\nFrom this definition, we can write $C_p = \\gamma C_V$. Substituting this into our result for the difference in heat capacities (eq. \\eqref{eq:CpCv_final}) allows us to solve for $C_V$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nC_p - C_V &= \\gamma C_V - C_V = (\\gamma - 1)C_V \\label{eq:CpCv_gamma} \\tag{5} \\\\\n\\text{Equating with eq. \\ref{eq:CpCv_final}: } \\quad (\\gamma - 1)C_V &= \\frac{45}{16} \\frac{pV}{T} \\nonumber \\\\\nC_V &= \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1} \\frac{45}{16} \\frac{pV}{T} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{Substituting } p = k V^{-4/5}T^{3/2}: \\quad C_V &= \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1} \\frac{45}{16} \\frac{(k V^{-4/5}T^{3/2})V}{T} \\nonumber \\\\\nC_V &= \\frac{45k}{16(\\gamma-1)} V^{1/5}T^{1/2}\n\\label{eq:Cv_expr1} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis expression gives $C_V$ as a function of $V$ and $T$, with $\\gamma$ as a parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Derive a second thermodynamic relation involving $C_V$\nTo determine the value of $\\gamma$, we need a second, independent constraint on the thermodynamic properties of the gas. Such a constraint is provided by the following thermodynamic identity, which follows from the fact that entropy is a state function (i.e., from Maxwell relations):\n\\[\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_V}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = T \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial T^2}\\right)_V}\\]\nWe first compute the second partial derivative of $p$ with respect to $T$ at constant $V$. From Step 1, we have $\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = \\frac{3}{2} k V^{-4/5}T^{1/2}$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial T^2}\\right)_V &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} k V^{-4/5}T^{1/2}\\right)_V \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{2} k V^{-4/5} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}T^{-1/2}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{4} k V^{-4/5}T^{-1/2}\n\\label{eq:d2pdT2} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting this result into the thermodynamic identity:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_V}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = T \\left(\\frac{3}{4} k V^{-4/5}T^{-1/2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{4} k V^{-4/5}T^{1/2}\n\\label{eq:dCvDV_expr2} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the value of $\\gamma$\nWe now have two independent ways to determine the partial derivative $\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_V}{\\partial V}\\right)_T$. The first is from the general thermodynamic identity (eq. \\eqref{eq:dCvDV_expr2}). The second is by directly differentiating our derived expression for $C_V$ (eq. \\eqref{eq:Cv_expr1}). The consistency between these two results will determine the value of $\\gamma$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\gamma$ is a constant, which is a crucial assumption for the following step.\n\\[\\boxed{\\gamma = \\text{constant}}\\]\nWe differentiate the expression for $C_V$ from eq. \\eqref{eq:Cv_expr1} with respect to $V$ at constant $T$, treating $\\gamma$ as a constant.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_V}{\\partial V}\\right)_T &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V} \\left(\\frac{45k}{16(\\gamma-1)} V^{1/5}T^{1/2}\\right)_T \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{45k T^{1/2}}{16(\\gamma-1)} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V}(V^{1/5}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{45k T^{1/2}}{16(\\gamma-1)} \\left(\\frac{1}{5}V^{-4/5}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{9k}{16(\\gamma-1)} V^{-4/5}T^{1/2}\n\\label{eq:dCvDV_expr1} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor the thermodynamic model to be consistent, the two expressions for $\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_V}{\\partial V}\\right)_T$, eq. \\eqref{eq:dCvDV_expr2} and eq. \\eqref{eq:dCvDV_expr1}, must be equal.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{9k}{16(\\gamma-1)} V^{-4/5}T^{1/2} &= \\frac{3}{4} k V^{-4/5}T^{1/2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe terms $k V^{-4/5}T^{1/2}$ are non-zero, so they can be cancelled from both sides, leaving an equation solely for $\\gamma$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{9}{16(\\gamma-1)} &= \\frac{3}{4} \\nonumber \\\\\n9 \\times 4 &= 3 \\times 16(\\gamma-1) \\nonumber \\\\\n36 &= 48(\\gamma-1) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\gamma-1 &= \\frac{36}{48} = \\frac{3}{4} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\gamma &= 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\n\\label{eq:gamma_final} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe value of the specific heat ratio $\\gamma$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\gamma = \\frac{7}{4}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}

The particle is subject to a static, non-uniform magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane.\n\nThe given information is organized as follows:\n*   **Particle Properties**:\n    *   Let the particle's mass be $m_p$ and its charge be $q_p$.\n    *   The charge-to-mass ratio is given as $\\frac{q_p}{m_p} = \\frac{3q}{2\\sqrt{2}m}$, where $q$ and $m$ are positive constants.\n\n*   **Magnetic Field**:\n    *   The magnetic field is directed vertically upwards, perpendicular to the plane of motion. We can write it as $\\vec{B} = B(r)\\hat{z}$, where $\\hat{z}$ is the unit vector normal to the plane.\n    *   The magnitude of the field depends on the radial distance $r$ from the origin: $B(r) = \\frac{mv}{q\\sqrt{ar}}$. Here, $a$, $m$, $q$, and $v$ are positive constants.\n\n*   **Initial Conditions**:\n    *   At time $t=0$, the particle is at the origin, so its initial position is $r(0)=0$.\n    *   It is projected with an initial speed $v_0$ along the polar axis, which is the direction $\\theta=0$.\n    *   This means the initial velocity vector is $\\vec{v}(0) = v_0 \\hat{r}$. In terms of polar velocity components, this implies the initial radial velocity is $\\dot{r}(0) = v_0$ and the initial tangential velocity is $v_\\theta(0) = r(0)\\dot{\\theta}(0) = 0$.\n\n*   **Assumptions**:\n    *   The magnetic force is the only force acting on the particle. Other forces like gravity are considered negligible.\n    *   The Lorentz force does no work, so the particle's kinetic energy and speed are constant. We assume that the parameter $v$ in the magnetic field's definition is equal to this constant speed, i.e., $v = v_0$. This is a common convention in such problems to ensure a self-consistent formulation. Thus, the magnetic field magnitude is $B(r) = \\frac{mv_0}{q\\sqrt{ar}}$.\n\n*   **Objective**:\n    *   To find the function $r(\\theta)$ that describes the particle's path.\n\n### Step 1: Equations of Motion in Polar Coordinates\nThe motion of the particle is governed by Newton's Second Law, where the net force is the Lorentz force due to the magnetic field.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m_p \\vec{a}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{\\text{Lorentz}} = q_p (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})}\\]\nIn polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, the velocity and acceleration vectors are expressed as:\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{v} = \\dot{r}\\hat{r} + r\\dot{\\theta}\\hat{\\theta}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\vec{a} = (\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2)\\hat{r} + (r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta})\\hat{\\theta}}\\]\nThe magnetic field is $\\vec{B} = B(r)\\hat{z}$. The Lorentz force is calculated by taking the cross product with the velocity vector. We use a right-handed coordinate system where $\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{\\theta} = \\hat{z}$, which implies $\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{z} = -\\hat{\\theta}$ and $\\hat{\\theta} \\times \\hat{z} = \\hat{r}$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{F} &= q_p ((\\dot{r}\\hat{r} + r\\dot{\\theta}\\hat{\\theta}) \\times B(r)\\hat{z}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= q_p B(r) (\\dot{r}(\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{z}) + r\\dot{\\theta}(\\hat{\\theta} \\times \\hat{z})) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= q_p B(r) (-\\dot{r}\\hat{\\theta} + r\\dot{\\theta}\\hat{r}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= q_p B(r) r\\dot{\\theta} \\hat{r} - q_p B(r) \\dot{r} \\hat{\\theta}\n\\label{eq:force} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBy equating the components of $m_p\\vec{a} = \\vec{F}$, we obtain the equations of motion:\n*   **Radial component ($\\hat{r}$)**:\n    \\[\\begin{align} m_p(\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2) = q_p B(r) r\\dot{\\theta} \\label{eq:radial_eom} \\tag{2} \\end{align}\\]\n*   **Tangential component ($\\hat{\\theta}$)**:\n    \\[\\begin{align} m_p(r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta}) = -q_p B(r) \\dot{r} \\label{eq:tangential_eom} \\tag{3} \\end{align}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Angular Velocity\nWe use the tangential equation of motion (Eq. \\ref{eq:tangential_eom}) to find the angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$. The left side of the equation is related to the time derivative of the specific angular momentum.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{d}{dt}(r^2\\dot{\\theta}) = 2r\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} + r^2\\ddot{\\theta} = r(2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} + r\\ddot{\\theta})}\\]\nUsing this identity, we can rewrite Eq. \\ref{eq:tangential_eom} as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{m_p}{r} \\frac{d(r^2\\dot{\\theta})}{dt} &= -q_p B(r) \\frac{dr}{dt} \\nonumber \\\\\nm_p \\, d(r^2\\dot{\\theta}) &= -q_p B(r) r \\, dr \\nonumber \\\\\nd(r^2\\dot{\\theta}) &= -\\frac{q_p}{m_p} B(r) r \\, dr \\label{eq:diff_ang_mom} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the given expressions for the charge-to-mass ratio $\\frac{q_p}{m_p} = \\frac{3q}{2\\sqrt{2}m}$ and the magnetic field $B(r) = \\frac{mv_0}{q\\sqrt{ar}}$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nd(r^2\\dot{\\theta}) &= -\\left(\\frac{3q}{2\\sqrt{2}m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{mv_0}{q\\sqrt{ar}}\\right) r \\, dr \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{3v_0}{2\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{a}} \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{r}} \\, dr \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{3v_0}{2\\sqrt{2a}} r^{1/2} \\, dr \\label{eq:diff_explicit} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state ($t=0$, where $r=0$ and the angular momentum $m_p r^2\\dot{\\theta}=0$) to a general state $(r, \\dot{\\theta})$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^{r^2\\dot{\\theta}} d(r'^2\\dot{\\theta}') &= \\int_{0}^{r} -\\frac{3v_0}{2\\sqrt{2a}} r'^{1/2} dr' \\nonumber \\\\\nr^2\\dot{\\theta} - 0 &= -\\frac{3v_0}{2\\sqrt{2a}} \\left[\\frac{r'^{3/2}}{3/2}\\right]_0^r \\nonumber \\\\\nr^2\\dot{\\theta} &= -\\frac{3v_0}{2\\sqrt{2a}} \\frac{2}{3} r^{3/2} = -\\frac{v_0}{\\sqrt{2a}} r^{3/2} \\label{eq:integrated_ang_mom} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSolving for the angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$ yields:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{\\theta} = -\\frac{v_0}{\\sqrt{2a}} \\frac{r^{3/2}}{r^2} = -\\frac{v_0}{\\sqrt{2ar}} \\label{eq:theta_dot} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Radial Velocity\nThe Lorentz force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle, so it does no work. According to the work-energy theorem, the kinetic energy of the particle must be conserved.\n\n\\[\\boxed{W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta E_k}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{W_{\\text{Lorentz}} = \\int \\vec{F}_{\\text{Lorentz}} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\int q_p(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot \\vec{v} dt = 0}\\]\nSince the net work is zero, the kinetic energy is constant. This implies the particle's speed remains constant and equal to its initial value, $v_0$.\n\\[\\boxed{v^2 = v_0^2}\\]\nThe speed squared in polar coordinates is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{v^2 = \\dot{r}^2 + (r\\dot{\\theta})^2}\\]\nCombining these principles, we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{r}^2 + (r\\dot{\\theta})^2 = v_0^2 \\label{eq:energy_cons} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\dot{\\theta}$ from Eq. \\ref{eq:theta_dot}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{r}^2 + \\left(r \\left(-\\frac{v_0}{\\sqrt{2ar}}\\right)\\right)^2 &= v_0^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{r}^2 + \\left(-\\frac{v_0\\sqrt{r}}{\\sqrt{2a}}\\right)^2 &= v_0^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{v_0^2 r}{2a} &= v_0^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{r}^2 &= v_0^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{r}{2a}\\right) \\label{eq:r_dot_sq} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTaking the square root gives the radial velocity. We choose the positive root because the particle is projected outwards from the origin, so its radial velocity must be initially positive ($\\dot{r}(0)=v_0$).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{r} = v_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r}{2a}} \\label{eq:r_dot} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Derivation and Solution of the Trajectory Equation\nTo find the trajectory $r(\\theta)$, we eliminate the time variable by relating $dr$ and $d\\theta$ using the chain rule.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{dr}{d\\theta} = \\frac{dr/dt}{d\\theta/dt} = \\frac{\\dot{r}}{\\dot{\\theta}}}\\]\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\dot{r}$ (Eq. \\ref{eq:r_dot}) and $\\dot{\\theta}$ (Eq. \\ref{eq:theta_dot}):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dr}{d\\theta} &= \\frac{v_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r}{2a}}}{-v_0 / \\sqrt{2ar}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\sqrt{2ar} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r}{2a}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\sqrt{2ar \\left(\\frac{2a-r}{2a}\\right)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\sqrt{r(2a-r)} = -\\sqrt{2ar - r^2} \\label{eq:traj_de} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation.

The beam has a rectangular cross-section, rests on two supports, and deflects under the weight of the mass.\n\nThe given physical quantities are:\n*   `a`: width of the beam's cross-section.\n*   `h`: thickness of the beam's cross-section.\n*   `E`: Young's modulus of the beam's material.\n*   `l`: distance between the two supports.\n*   `m`: mass of the weight placed on the beam.\n*   `g`: acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe goal is to find the angular frequency `ω` of the horizontal vibration when the mass is given a small perturbation from its central equilibrium position.\n\nWe establish a coordinate system where the origin `(0,0)` is at the center of the span on the axis of the undeflected beam. The x-axis is horizontal along the beam's length, and the y-axis is vertical, pointing downwards. The supports are located at `x = -l/2` and `x = l/2`.\n\nThe following assumptions are made based on the problem statement:\n1.  The beam is treated as \"simply supported\" at the two ends of the span `l`.\n2.  The deflection of the beam is small, allowing the use of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.\n3.  The weight of the beam itself is negligible compared to the weight of the mass `m`.\n4.  Friction and air resistance are negligible.\n\nThe physical approach is to determine the total potential energy of the system (gravitational and elastic) as a function of the mass's horizontal position `x`. The system will oscillate around the position of minimum potential energy. By approximating the potential energy function as a parabola near this minimum, we can find an effective spring constant for the horizontal motion and subsequently the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\n### Step 1: Vertical Deflection of the Beam\nFirst, we determine the vertical deflection of the beam, `y_m(x)`, at the point where the mass `m` is located, as a function of its horizontal position `x`. We use standard formulas from Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.\n\nFor a simply supported beam of length `l` subjected to a point load `F` at distances `b` and `c` from the two supports, the vertical deflection under the load is given by:\n\\[\\boxed{ y_{\\text{load}} = \\frac{F b^2 c^2}{3EIl} }\\]\nThe term `I` is the second moment of area of the beam's cross-section. For a rectangular cross-section of width `a` and thickness `h`, it is:\n\\[\\boxed{ I = \\frac{ah^3}{12} }\\]\nIn our case, the load is the weight of the mass, `F = mg`. The mass is at a horizontal position `x` measured from the center. The distances to the supports at `x = -l/2` and `x = l/2` are `c = x - (-l/2) = l/2 + x` and `b = l/2 - x`, respectively.\nSubstituting these into the deflection formula:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ny_m(x) &= \\frac{mg \\left(\\frac{l}{2} - x\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{l}{2} + x\\right)^2}{3EIl} \\\\\n&= \\frac{mg \\left[\\left(\\frac{l}{2} - x\\right)\\left(\\frac{l}{2} + x\\right)\\right]^2}{3EIl} = \\frac{mg \\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right)^2}{3EIl} \\label{eq:deflection_I} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we substitute the expression for `I`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ny_m(x) &= \\frac{mg \\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right)^2}{3E\\left(\\frac{ah^3}{12}\\right)l} = \\frac{12mg \\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right)^2}{3Eah^3l} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4mg}{Eah^3l} \\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right)^2 \\label{eq:deflection_x} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Potential Energy of the System\nThe total potential energy `U` of the system is the sum of the mass's gravitational potential energy `U_g` and the beam's elastic potential energy `U_e`.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy of the mass `m` at a vertical displacement `y` (downwards) is:\n\\[\\boxed{ U_g = -mgy }\\]\nThe elastic potential energy stored in a linearly elastic beam due to a gradually applied point load `F` that causes a deflection `y` is:\n\\[\\boxed{ U_e = \\frac{1}{2} F y }\\]\nThe total potential energy `U(x)` as a function of the mass's horizontal position `x` is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(x) &= U_g(x) + U_e(x) \\\\\n&= -mg y_m(x) + \\frac{1}{2} (mg) y_m(x) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2} mg y_m(x) \\label{eq:U_total_1} \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expression for `y_m(x)` from Eq. \\eqref{eq:deflection_x}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(x) = -\\frac{1}{2} mg \\left[ \\frac{4mg}{Eah^3l} \\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right)^2 \\right] = -\\frac{2m^2g^2}{Eah^3l} \\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right)^2 \\label{eq:U_total_2} \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Effective Spring Constant for Small Horizontal Oscillations\nFor small horizontal oscillations, the mass moves about its stable equilibrium position. The potential energy function `U(x)` can be approximated by a quadratic function near this point. The effective spring constant `k` of this harmonic potential determines the restoring force.\n\nThe potential energy of a system oscillating about a stable equilibrium point `x_0` can be approximated using a Taylor series expansion:\n\\[\\boxed{ U(x) \\approx U(x_0) + \\left.\\frac{dU}{dx}\\right|_{x=x_0}(x-x_0) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left.\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}\\right|_{x=x_0}(x-x_0)^2 }\\]\nFor a simple harmonic oscillator, this simplifies to `U_{osc} = \\frac{1}{2}k(x-x_0)^2`, where the effective spring constant is `k = \\left.\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}\\right|_{x=x_0}`.\n\nFirst, we find the equilibrium position `x_0` by finding where the force `F_x = -dU/dx` is zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dU}{dx} &= -\\frac{2m^2g^2}{Eah^3l} \\cdot 2\\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right) \\cdot (-2x) = \\frac{8m^2g^2x}{Eah^3l} \\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right) \\label{eq:dUdx} \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSetting `dU/dx = 0` gives `x=0` as the equilibrium position (the center of the beam). Next, we find the second derivative to determine the effective spring constant `k`.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} &= \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{8m^2g^2}{Eah^3l} \\left(\\frac{l^2x}{4} - x^3\\right) \\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{8m^2g^2}{Eah^3l} \\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - 3x^2\\right) \\label{eq:d2Udx2} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEvaluating the second derivative at the equilibrium position `x=0`:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nk = \\left.\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}\\right|_{x=0} = \\frac{8m^2g^2}{Eah^3l} \\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - 0\\right) = \\frac{2m^2g^2l}{Eah^3} \\label{eq:k_eff} \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Angular Frequency of Oscillation\nThe system can be modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator with mass `m` and the effective spring constant `k` found in Step 3.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the oscillating mass is:\n\\[\\boxed{ E_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 }\\]\nFor small horizontal oscillations, the path of the mass is nearly horizontal. The vertical component of velocity `v_y` is much smaller than the horizontal component `v_x = \\dot{x}`. Thus, we can approximate the kinetic energy by considering only the horizontal motion: `E_k \\approx \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2`.\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by the relation:\n\\[\\boxed{ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} }\\]\nUsing the mass `m` and the effective spring constant `k` from Eq. \\eqref{eq:k_eff}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega^2 &= \\frac{k}{m} = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\frac{2m^2g^2l}{Eah^3} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{2mg^2l}{Eah^3} \\label{eq:omega_sq} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTaking the square root gives the angular frequency of the small horizontal vibrations.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mg^2l}{Eah^3}} \\label{eq:omega} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angular frequency of the small horizontal vibration of the system is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mg^2l}{Eah^3}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"}
{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "tag": "ELECTRICITY", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$.

We assume a state of full ionization, where all $N$ initial atoms have separated into $N$ positive ions (mass $m_N$, charge $+e$) and $N$ free electrons (mass $m_e$, charge $-e$). The neutral particles are ignored in the density calculation.\n*   **Particle Distribution Assumptions:**\n    *   The spatial distribution of ions and electrons is determined by thermal equilibrium in the rotating frame, following a Boltzmann distribution under an effective potential from the centrifugal force.\n    *   Electrostatic interactions between charged particles are ignored when calculating their number densities, but the resulting macroscopic electric field is calculated from these densities.\n    *   All charged particles are confined within the cylindrical volume.\n*   **Constants and Parameters:**\n    *   $k_B$: Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $\\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space.\n    *   $k = \\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_B T_0}$: A given parameter for simplification.\n\n**UAV Model:**\n*   **Physical Properties:** The UAV has mass $m$, a small volume $V$ (such that $V^{1/3} \\ll R$), and carries an electric charge $q_0$.\n*   **Initial State:** It is initially in a stable circular orbit at a radius $r_0$, co-rotating with the typhoon at the same angular velocity $\\omega$.\n*   **Dynamics:** The UAV can only generate vertical thrust, which is irrelevant for the radial motion. At time $t=0$, it receives a small radial velocity perturbation $\\vec{v}_{0}$ ($v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$), causing it to undergo small radial oscillations.\n\n**Objective:**\nCalculate the angular frequency $\\Omega$ of the UAV's periodic radial oscillations.\n\n### Step 1: Particle Density Distributions in the Rotating Frame\nIn the reference frame rotating with the typhoon at angular velocity $\\omega$, a particle of mass $m_{\\text{particle}}$ experiences a centrifugal force, which can be described by an effective potential energy. The particles are in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T_0$, so their number density $n(r)$ follows the Boltzmann distribution.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ V_{\\text{eff}}(r) = -\\frac{1}{2} m_{\\text{particle}} \\omega^2 r^2 }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ n(r) = n_0 e^{-\\frac{V_{\\text{eff}}(r)}{k_B T_0}} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\int_{\\text{Volume}} n(r) dV = N_{\\text{total}} }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe number density $n(r)$ for a particle species at a radial distance $r$ is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn(r) &= n_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}m_{\\text{particle}}\\omega^2r^2}{k_B T_0}\\right) = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{m_{\\text{particle}}\\omega^2r^2}{2k_B T_0}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= n_0 e^{m_{\\text{particle}}kr^2} \\label{eq:density_form}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $n_0$ is a normalization constant and $k = \\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_B T_0}$. The total number of positive ions and free electrons is each $N$. We find $n_0$ for each species by integrating its number density over the cylindrical volume and setting it equal to $N$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nN &= \\int_0^H dz \\int_0^R (2\\pi r dr) \\, n(r) = 2\\pi H \\int_0^R n_0 e^{m_{\\text{particle}}kr^2} r dr \\label{eq:norm_integral}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution $u = m_{\\text{particle}}kr^2$, which gives $du = 2m_{\\text{particle}}kr dr$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^R r e^{m_{\\text{particle}}kr^2} dr = \\frac{1}{2m_{\\text{particle}}k} \\int_0^{m_{\\text{particle}}kR^2} e^u du = \\frac{1}{2m_{\\text{particle}}k} \\left(e^{m_{\\text{particle}}kR^2} - 1\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting this back into Eq. \\eqref{eq:norm_integral} and solving for the normalization constant $n_0$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nN &= 2\\pi H n_0 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2m_{\\text{particle}}k} (e^{m_{\\text{particle}}kR^2} - 1) \\right] \\implies n_0 = \\frac{N m_{\\text{particle}}k}{\\pi H (e^{m_{\\text{particle}}kR^2} - 1)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nApplying this general result to the positive ions (mass $m_N$) and electrons (mass $m_e$), we obtain their respective number densities:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn_+(r) &= \\frac{N m_N k}{\\pi H (e^{m_N k R^2} - 1)} e^{m_N kr^2} \\label{eq:n_plus} \\\\\nn_-(r) &= \\frac{N m_e k}{\\pi H (e^{m_e k R^2} - 1)} e^{m_e kr^2} \\label{eq:n_minus}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Charge Density and Electric Field\nThe difference in mass between ions and electrons ($m_N \\gg m_e$) causes a radial separation of charge. The heavier positive ions are pushed further outwards by the centrifugal force than the lighter electrons. This creates a net charge density $\\rho_q(r)$ and a radial electric field $E(r)$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\rho_q(r) = e(n_+(r) - n_-(r)) }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\oint_S \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{enc}}}{\\varepsilon_0} \\quad (\\text{Gauss's Law}) }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe net charge density at radius $r$ is the difference between the positive and negative charge densities.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_q(r) = e n_+(r) - e n_-(r) = e(n_+(r) - n_-(r))\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nDue to cylindrical symmetry, the electric field must be purely radial, $\\vec{E}(r) = E(r)\\hat{r}$. We apply Gauss's Law to a cylindrical surface of radius $r$ and height $H$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE(r) \\cdot (2\\pi r H) &= \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0} Q_{\\text{enc}} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0} \\int_0^H dz \\int_0^r (2\\pi r' dr') \\, \\rho_q(r') \\\\\nE(r) &= \\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0 r} \\int_0^r (n_+(r') - n_-(r')) r' dr'\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe integral of $n_{\\text{particle}}(r')r'$ was effectively solved in Step 1. The total number of particles of a species inside radius $r$ is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^H dz \\int_0^r (2\\pi r' dr') n_{\\text{particle}}(r') = 2\\pi H \\int_0^r n_0 e^{m_{\\text{particle}}kr'^2} r' dr' = N \\frac{e^{m_{\\text{particle}} kr^2} - 1}{e^{m_{\\text{particle}} k R^2} - 1}\n\\end{align}\nThus, the integral $\\int_0^r n_{\\text{particle}}(r') r' dr'$ is $\\frac{N}{2\\pi H} \\frac{e^{m_{\\text{particle}} kr^2} - 1}{e^{m_{\\text{particle}} k R^2} - 1}$. Substituting this into the expression for $E(r)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE(r) = \\frac{Ne}{2\\pi \\varepsilon_0 H r} \\left[ \\frac{e^{m_N kr^2} - 1}{e^{m_N k R^2} - 1} - \\frac{e^{m_e kr^2} - 1}{e^{m_e k R^2} - 1} \\right] \\label{eq:Efield}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Fluid Hydrostatic Equilibrium\nIn the rotating frame, the plasma is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The outward pressure gradient force is balanced by the inward body forces acting on the fluid.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\nabla P = \\vec{f}_{\\text{body}} }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe body forces per unit volume acting on the plasma are the centrifugal force density, $\\vec{f}_{cf} = \\rho_m(r) \\omega^2 r \\hat{r}$, and the electric force density, $\\vec{f}_{E} = \\rho_q(r) \\vec{E}(r)$. The total mass density of the plasma is $\\rho_m(r) = m_N n_+(r) + m_e n_-(r)$. The equilibrium condition in the radial direction is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dP}{dr} = f_{cf} + f_E = \\rho_m(r) \\omega^2 r + \\rho_q(r) E(r) \\label{eq:pressure_gradient}\n\\end{align}\nThis equation gives the pressure gradient required to maintain the solid-body rotation of the plasma.\n\n### Step 4: Forces on the UAV\nThe UAV is subject to physical forces from the surrounding plasma and the electric field. We analyze these forces in the inertial (lab) frame.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\vec{F}_{\\text{buoyancy}} = -\\int_V \\nabla P \\, dV' }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\vec{F}_{\\text{electric}} = q_0 \\vec{E} }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe total physical radial force, $F_{r, \\text{phys}}$, on the UAV is the sum of the electric force and the buoyancy force.\n1.  **Electric Force:** The force on the UAV's charge $q_0$ is $F_{E, UAV}(r) = q_0 E(r)$.\n2.  **Buoyancy Force:** Since the UAV has a small volume $V$ ($V^{1/3} \\ll R$), the pressure gradient $\\nabla P$ is approximately constant over its volume. The buoyancy force is $\\vec{F}_B \\approx -V \\nabla P$. The radial component is:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    F_B(r) = -V \\frac{dP}{dr}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\n    Using the pressure gradient from Eq. \\eqref{eq:pressure_gradient}:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    F_B(r) = -V \\left( \\rho_m(r) \\omega^2 r + \\rho_q(r) E(r) \\right) \\label{eq:buoyancy}\n    \\end{align}\n    \\]\nThe total physical radial force on the UAV is the sum of these two forces:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF_{r, \\text{phys}}(r) &= F_{E, UAV}(r) + F_B(r) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= q_0 E(r) - V \\left( \\rho_m(r) \\omega^2 r + \\rho_q(r) E(r) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (q_0 - V\\rho_q(r))E(r) - V\\rho_m(r)\\omega^2 r \\label{eq:radial_force}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Equilibrium Condition for UAV Orbit\nFor the UAV to maintain a stable circular orbit at radius $r_0$ with angular velocity $\\omega$, the net physical radial force must provide the necessary centripetal force.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a} }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nIn the inertial frame, the acceleration for a circular orbit of radius $r_0$ at angular velocity $\\omega$ is the centripetal acceleration, $a_r = -\\omega^2 r_0$. Applying Newton's second law in the radial direction:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF_{r, \\text{phys}}(r_0) = m a_r = -m \\omega^2 r_0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting the force expression from Eq. \\eqref{eq:radial_force} gives the equilibrium condition that determines the stable radius $r_0$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(q_0 - V\\rho_q(r_0))E(r_0) - V\\rho_m(r_0)\\omega^2 r_0 = -m \\omega^2 r_0 \\label{eq:equilibrium}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Perturbation Analysis and Oscillation Frequency\nWe analyze small radial oscillations around the equilibrium radius $r_0$. The motion is governed by the radial equation of motion in the inertial frame, accounting for the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ m\\ddot{r} = F_r(r) + \\frac{L_z^2}{mr^3} }\\]\n\\[\\boxed{ \\Omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}}{m_{\\text{object}}}} \\quad (\\text{for SHM } m\\ddot{x} = -k_{\\text{eff}}x) }\\]\n\n**Derivation:**\nThe radial equation of motion for the UAV is $m(\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2) = F_{r, \\text{phys}}(r)$. Since there are no tangential forces on the UAV, its angular momentum $L_z = mr^2\\dot{\\theta}$ is conserved. From the initial condition ($r=r_0, \\dot{\\theta}=\\omega$), we have $L_z = mr_0^2\\omega$. Thus, $\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{r_0^2\\omega}{r^2}$. The equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm\\ddot{r} = F_{r, \\text{phys}}(r) + mr\\left(\\frac{r_0^2\\omega}{r^2}\\right)^2 = F_{r, \\text{phys}}(r) + \\frac{m r_0^4 \\omega^2}{r^3}\n\\end{align}\nLet $G(r) = F_{r, \\text{phys}}(r) + \\frac{m r_0^4 \\omega^2}{r^3}$ be the total effective radial force. For a small perturbation $r(t) = r_0 + \\delta r(t)$, we expand $G(r)$ in a Taylor series around $r_0$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm\\ddot{\\delta r} \\approx G(r_0) + \\left.\\frac{dG}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_0} \\delta r\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAt the equilibrium radius $r_0$, $G(r_0) = F_{r, \\text{phys}}(r_0) + \\frac{m r_0^4 \\omega^2}{r_0^3} = F_{r, \\text{phys}}(r_0) + m r_0 \\omega^2$. Using the equilibrium condition from Eq. \\eqref{eq:equilibrium}, $F_{r, \\text{phys}}(r_0) = -m r_0 \\omega^2$, we find that $G(r_0) = 0$. The equation for the perturbation simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nm\\ddot{\\delta r} = \\left(\\left.\\frac{dG}{dr}\\right|_{r_0}\\right) \\delta r\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is the equation for simple harmonic motion, $m\\ddot{\\delta r} = -k_{\\text{eff}}\\delta r$, with an effective spring constant $k_{\\text{eff}} = -\\left.\\frac{dG}{dr}\\right|_{r_0}$. The angular frequency of this oscillation is $\\Omega = \\sqrt{k_{\\text{eff}}/m}$.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Omega^2 = \\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}}{m} = -\\frac{1}{m}\\left.\\frac{dG}{dr}\\right|_{r_0}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe now compute the derivative of $G(r)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dG}{dr} = \\frac{dF_{r, \\text{phys}}}{dr} + m r_0^4 \\omega^2 \\left(-\\frac{3}{r^4}\\right) \\implies \\left.\\frac{dG}{dr}\\right|_{r_0} = \\left.\\frac{dF_{r, \\text{phys}}}{dr}\\right|_{r_0} - 3m\\omega^2\n\\end{align}\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Omega^2$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Omega^2 = -\\frac{1}{m}\\left( \\left.\\frac{dF_{r, \\text{phys}}}{dr}\\right|_{r_0} - 3m\\omega^2 \\right) = 3\\omega^2 - \\frac{1}{m}\\left.\\frac{dF_{r, \\text{phys}}}{dr}\\right|_{r_0}\n\\end{align}\nDifferentiating the physical force from Eq. \\eqref{eq:radial_force}:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dF_{r, \\text{phys}}}{dr} &= \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[ (q_0 - V\\rho_q(r))E(r) - V\\rho_m(r)\\omega^2 r \\right] \\\\\n&= (q_0 - V\\rho_q(r))\\frac{dE}{dr} - V E(r) \\frac{d\\rho_q}{dr} - V\\omega^2 \\frac{d}{dr}(r\\rho_m(r))\n\\end{align}\nEvaluating at $r=r_0$ and substituting into the expression for $\\Omega^2$ gives the final result.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Omega^2 = 3\\omega^2 - \\frac{1}{m} \\left[ (q_0 - V\\rho_q(r_0))\\left.\\frac{dE}{dr}\\right|_{r_0} - V E(r_0)\\left.\\frac{d\\rho_q}{dr}\\right|_{r_0} - V\\omega^2 \\left.\\frac{d(r\\rho_m)}{dr}\\right|_{r_0} \\right] \\label{eq:omega_sq_final}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe precession angular frequency $\\Omega$ of the UAV's radial oscillations is given by the square root of the following expression. The expression depends on the UAV's properties ($m, V, q_0$), the typhoon's parameters ($\\omega, T_0, N, R, H$), and the equilibrium radius $r_0$.
