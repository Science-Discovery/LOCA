Your task is to take a given physics problem, its potentially incomplete solution (Note that the original answer is not necessarily incomplete) and a report of bugs in this solution (Note that if the report shows no bugs, it is not necessarily no bugs), and produce a complete, step-by-step 'Refined Solution'. This refined solution MUST fix ALL bugs in the report, by adding or modifying missing steps, statements, principles, derivations, etc., to make the solution completed according to the problem statement and also make the logic clear, rigorous, and self-contained.\nYou should Not modify the final answer unless there is an inevitable contradiction during the derivation process.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following strict formatting rules for your output:\n\n1.  **Start Marker**: The entire output MUST begin *exactly* with the line `# Refined Solution` and nothing before it.\n2.  **Sectioning**: The solution must be structured into sections using `###` headings.\n3.  **First Section**: The first section MUST be titled `### Problem Statement Explanation`. In this section, you should detail and organize the information given in the problem statement, describe the physical situation / process, define all relevant variables one-by-one, and state any overall assumptions (e.g.,  approximations, geometric relations). You can not ignore any information in the problem statement.\n4.  **Step Sections**: All following sections MUST be titled `### Step XXX`, where `XXX` is a number starting from 1 (e.g., `### Step 1`, `### Step 2`, ...). These sections should present the logical flow of the solution.\n5.  **Content of Step Sections**: In the given solution, some parts are derivations or calculations, while others DIRECTLY adopt / introduce original formulas / assumptions / theorems / principles / geometric relations / boundary conditions. Within each `### Step XXX` section, you must follow this two-part structure:\n-   **Principles/Original Formulas/Assumptions**: State all the original formulas / assumptions / theorems / physical principles / geometric relations / approximations / boundary conditions in their most original / general / universal / standard forms(i.e., according to physical theories / principles) being used in that step (maybe more than 1). Note that this must be in their most original, general, universal, or standard forms. Each of them MUST be placed on its own line and enclosed within a `\\[\\boxed{}\\]` environment in a single line.\n-   **Derivation**: Provide the subsequent mathematical derivation that APPLIES this original formulas, assumptions, physical principles, etc., to the problem(except for the verification of the principle itself). This derivation MUST be enclosed within an `align` environment (e.g., `\\[\\begin{align} ... \\end{align}\\]`) with \\label{} and \\tag{} for reference.\n6.  **Final Section**: The very last section of your output MUST be titled `### Final Answer`. In this section, you must clearly state the final result, and the mathematical expression for the answer MUST be enclosed within a `\\[\\begin{align} ... \\end{align}\\]` environment.\n\nFor example, given this problem and incomplete solution:\n# Problem Statement\nFind the acceleration 'a' of an apple with mass 'm', free falling near the ground with gravitational acceleration constant 'g'.\n# Solution\nThe gravity on the apple is F_G = mg. Using Newton's second law F = ma, the acceleration is a = g.\nYour refined solution should look like this:\n# Refined Solution\n### Problem Statement Explanation\nThis problem asks for the acceleration `a` of an apple of mass `m`. The apple is in a state of free fall near the Earth's surface, where the gravitational acceleration is a constant `g`. We assume that air resistance is negligible. The goal is to express `a` in terms of `m` and `g`.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Net Force on the Apple\nFirst, we identify all forces acting on the apple. In a free-fall scenario where air resistance is neglected, the only force is the gravitational force exerted by the Earth. The formula for gravitational force near the Earth's surface is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{F_g = mg}\n\\]\nTherefore, the net force acting on the apple is equal to the gravitational force.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF_{\\text{net}} = F_g = mg\n\\label{eq:net_force} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply Newton's Second Law of Motion\nNext, we relate the net force on an object to its acceleration using Newton's Second Law of Motion. The standard form of the law is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{F_{\\text{net}} = ma}\n\\]\nWe can now substitute the net force we found in Step 1 into this equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nma &= F_{\\text{net}} \\nonumber \\ \nma &= mg \\quad (\\text{using eq. \\ref{eq:net_force}}) \\nonumber \\ \na &= g\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, the acceleration of the apple is equal to the gravitational acceleration constant `g`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\boxed{a = g}\n\\end{align}\n\\]"
