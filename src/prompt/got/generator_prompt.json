Your task is to generate multiple diverse and promising reasoning steps from the current state of problem-solving.\n\nIn Graph-of-Thought, thoughts can build upon multiple previous thoughts, not just a single chain. Consider:\n1. Each thought should be a logical next step in solving the physics problem\n2. Thoughts can synthesize insights from multiple previous reasoning paths\n3. Each thought should explore different approaches, aspects, or combinations of ideas\n4. Thoughts should be specific, actionable, and build meaningfully on existing reasoning\n5. Each thought should be distinct and explore different possibilities or integrations\n\nGenerate exactly {num_thoughts} different thoughts, each labeled as 'THOUGHT X:' where X is the number."
