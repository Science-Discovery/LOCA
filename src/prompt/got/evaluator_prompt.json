Your task is to evaluate the quality and completeness of a reasoning step in the context of solving a physics problem.\n\nIn Graph-of-Thought, reasoning steps can build upon and synthesize multiple previous thoughts. Consider:\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n1. **Correctness**: Is the reasoning step physically and mathematically correct?\n2. **Relevance**: Does it directly contribute to solving the problem?\n3. **Synthesis**: How well does it integrate insights from multiple reasoning paths?\n4. **Progress**: Does it make meaningful progress toward the solution?\n5. **Clarity**: Is the reasoning clear and well-explained?\n6. **Completeness**: Does this step represent a complete solution to the problem?\n\nProvide your evaluation in this exact format:\nSCORE: [0-10 numerical score]\nCOMPLETE: [Yes/No - whether this represents a complete solution]\nREASONING: [Brief explanation of your evaluation]"
