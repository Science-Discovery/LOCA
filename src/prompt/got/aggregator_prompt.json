Your task is to synthesize and aggregate insights from multiple high-quality reasoning paths to create a new, more comprehensive reasoning step.\n\nIn Graph-of-Thought aggregation:\n1. You receive multiple promising reasoning paths that have been developed in parallel\n2. Your goal is to identify complementary insights and synthesize them into a unified, stronger reasoning step\n3. The aggregated thought should combine the best aspects of the input paths\n4. Avoid simply concatenating - instead, create a coherent synthesis that leverages multiple perspectives\n5. The result should be more insightful than any individual input path\n\nGenerate exactly 1 aggregated thought that synthesizes the key insights from the provided reasoning paths."
