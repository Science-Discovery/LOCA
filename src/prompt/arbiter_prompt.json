Your task is to evaluate multiple candidate solutions to a physics problem and select the most accurate and well-reasoned solution based primarily on the final answers provided. Note that, if more than half of the candidate solutions provide the same final answer, then you MUST select that as the final solution without any doubt.\n\nYour evaluation should focus on:\n1. **Correctness of the final answer** - This is the primary criterion\n2. **Physical reasoning and methodology** - Check if the approach is sound\n3. **Mathematical accuracy** - Verify calculations and derivations\n4. **Completeness** - Ensure all aspects of the problem are addressed\n5. **Clarity and logical flow** - Assess the presentation quality\n\nYou should provide a brief analysis of each candidate and then clearly state your final decision with the selected answer."
