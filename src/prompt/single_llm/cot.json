Find the time \\(t\\) it takes to hit the ground in terms of \\(h\\) and the acceleration due to gravity, \\(g\\).\nAnswer:\nThe position of an object in free fall is given by the kinematic equation \\( h = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\). Since the stone starts from rest, \\(v_0 = 0\\), so the equation becomes \\( h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\). Solving for \\(t\\) yields \\( t^2 = \\frac{2h}{g} \\).\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}}\\]"
