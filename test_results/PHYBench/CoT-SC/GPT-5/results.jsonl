{"id": "OPTICS/495", "questions": "In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate.

The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

It satisfies total energy balance and shows near-contact divergence. However, the resulting local “factor” can exceed 1 for finite gaps (easily verified with sample numbers), which is unphysical for the local fraction of hemispherical emission/irradiation between diffuse black surfaces.

Thus, despite elegant math, the result is not physically consistent.\n\n- Candidate 2: Proposes p(θ) ∝ σ (T1^4 − T2^4) r/d(θ). This simple “sin γ = r/d” result comes from an oversimplified projected-solid-angle argument for an infinite cylinder and generally does not satisfy the exact integral identities (it would lead to elliptic-integral dependence in total energy, yet must reduce to a constant total).

As such, the conclusion A_φ = θ0 is not supported.\n\n- Candidate 3: Sets up a similar kinetic energy structure but omits the translational kinetic energy associated with the moving shoulder point for the arms, effectively using only (1/2) I_shoulder ω^2 and missing the (1/2) m v_shoulder^2 term. This leads to an incorrect inertia balance and an erroneous ratio A_φ = (10/17) θ0.\n\n- Candidate 4: Concludes zero amplitude by arguing that with no hip couple, the leg’s angular momentum about the hip implies no motion. This applies an angular momentum balance about a moving point (the hip) incorrectly; in a moving/accelerating pivot scenario, that simplification is invalid. The leg’s absolute angular momentum about the hip is conserved (with no hip couple), but this does not imply zero relative motion; instead, it constrains ψ̇ + φ̇, leading to a nonzero relative amplitude.\n\n- Candidate 5: Introduces gravity and treats the leg as a driven physical pendulum with a gravitational restoring torque, contradicting the free-fall condition.

Analysis of Candidate 1\n- Positives: Uses a clear statics-based lever-arm argument for load sharing between two parallel supports; derives a simple condition RL = 0 ⇒ xb = d and uses the bead’s energy to bound xb.\n- Issues: Neglects the strings’ direction (tension vs vertical component), all inertial effects, and the arc’s own mass distribution in dynamics. Most critically, it predicts d_max independent of L and capped by R, which is physically dubious given the dynamic nature and the presence of rotational and bifilar (two-string) effects. The assumption RL + RR = 2mg at the critical moment is generally invalid during oscillations.\n- Conclusion: Oversimplified; likely incorrect.\n\n2. Analysis of Candidate 2\n- Positives: Attempts a systematic small-oscillation linearization including string geometry (L), arc COM, and coupled coordinates; keeps careful bookkeeping of parameters.\n- Issues: The final condition is extremely complicated and implicit, with questionable scaling. In the near-2R limit it predicts growth of d_max with sqrt(L) without a clear physical cap, and the structure suggests possible internal inconsistencies. The approach seems over-engineered for the question and likely contains modeling missteps (e.g., treatment of bifilar geometry and effective stiffness).\n- Conclusion: Not reliable; unlikely correct.\n\n3. Analysis of Candidate 3\n- Positives: Identifies the antisymmetric (rocking/bifilar) mode as most effective for unloading one side and explicitly includes dynamics through ΔT and kφ, leading to a clean, closed-form criterion. Uses the turning-point (zero velocity) condition to maximize tension difference and derives a transparent threshold condition and a simple expression for d_max with clear parameter dependence.\n- Issues: Assumes the bead follows δ = 0 to eliminate its φ-stiffness (which is favorable for maximizing ΔT); small-oscillation approximations and neglect of small corrections to S = T1 + T2 ≈ Mg are made. However, these are reasonable in the stated regime.\n- Conclusion: Physically well-motivated, mathematically consistent to leading order; the most convincing solution.\n\n4. Analysis of Candidate 4\n- Positives: Uses d’Alembert and a parallel-force picture; attempts to include geometry with chord separation d = 2R sin φ and derives an explicit formula.\n- Issues: Predicts d_max scaling like R sqrt(E0/(mgL)), which decreases with increasing L, contrary to physical expectations for the bifilar contribution. The chain of approximations appears inconsistent (dominant gravity moments asserted while invoking dynamics), and the final formula’s scaling is suspect.\n- Conclusion: Likely incorrect.\n\n5. Analysis of Candidate 5\n- Positives: Simple model focusing on COM swing; produces an implicit equation easy to evaluate numerically.\n- Issues: Reduces the entire system to a single COM pendulum and equates slack with the COM passing under a support, which is not the correct criterion for a bifilar suspension with internal degrees of freedom.

It reproduces the correct small-angle limit and the heavy-sphere limit, and uses the proper rod inertia about the axis (Ir = (m/3)R^2 sin^2θ via the geometry identity R sinθ = L sinθrod). The final expression has the expected φ-dependence through both sinφ and (1 − cosφ) terms. This is the most complete and consistent solution.\n- Candidate 2: Finds T correctly from the shared angular acceleration, but computes N from a balance that effectively neglects the ω2 term. The result μ ∝ tanφ for all φ misses the dynamic reduction of N as ω grows and is only valid in the infinitesimal-angle (ω ≈ 0) limit. It matches the small-φ behavior but is not generally correct.\n- Candidate 3: Similar in spirit to Candidate 2, yielding μ = const × tanφ. It explicitly assumes the “turning-point” (ω ≈ 0) limit to get N, so it agrees with the small-φ expansion but omits the ω2 contribution needed for general φ. Hence it is incomplete for the posed dynamic scenario.\n- Candidate 4: Also attempts a full dynamic treatment, but its normal force reduces at small φ to N ≈ (mg/2) cosφ, independent of geometry, which conflicts with the correct static-limit moment balance (which gives a geometry-dependent N). Its small-angle limit for μ lacks the expected geometry factor, so the result is inconsistent.\n- Candidate 5: Predicts μ ∝ |cotφ|, which diverges as φ → 0, contradicting the correct small-angle behavior where μ → 0.

The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. Next, we utilize the following property: the infinitesimal displacement caused by an increase in $\\mu$ between equipotential surfaces is the derivative of the coordinates with respect to $\\mu$:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x=a\\mathrm{sh}\\mu\\cos\\nu\\mathrm{d}\\mu\\quad,\\quad\\mathrm{d}z=a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\\sin\\nu\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\n\nWe proceed to calculate the length of this displacement:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}s={\\sqrt{\\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\\mathrm{d}z^{2}}}=a{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{ch}^{2}\\mu-\\cos^{2}\\nu}}\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the electric potential difference caused by displacements between one ellipse and another. This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2). We obtain the following equation:\n\n$$\n{\\frac{E_{0}a^{2}}{a^{2}+a^{2}\\mathrm{{sh}}^{2}\\mu\\sin^{2}{90^{\\circ}}}}\\cdot a\\mathrm{{ch}}\\mu\\mathrm{{d}}\\mu=E\\cdot a{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{{ch}}^{2}\\mu-\\cos^{2}\\nu}}\\mathrm{{d}}\\mu\n$$\n\nThis gives the distribution of electric field strength. To determine the direction of electric field lines, we only need to locate the bisector of the angle formed by lines connecting the two foci:\n\n$$\n\\theta={\\frac{\\theta_{+}+\\theta_{-}}{2}}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\tan\\theta_{\\pm}={\\frac{z}{x\\pm a}}\n$$\n\nWe organize the result:\n\n$$\nf(x,z)={\\frac{2a^{2}}{\\left[{\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}}+{\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right]^{2}}}\\left[\\left[{\\frac{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{4}}+\\left[{\\frac{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\right]~.\n$$\n\nWith $z=0$, $x=r$, we obtain:\n\n$$\nf(r)=\\frac{2a^{2}}{(r+a+|r-a|)\\sqrt{|r^{2}-a^{2}|}}\n$$\n\nFor the electric field, a charged circular disk with radius $a$ is required to generate it.

{"id": "MECHANICS/716", "questions": "The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q. A lightweight, smooth-walled insulating thin tube can rotate around a vertical axis through point O in the horizontal plane. At a distance L from point O inside the tube, there is a photoelectric trigger control switch A. A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q.

To find the canonical angular momentum, we list the corresponding rate of change equation:  $$ \\frac{d L}{d t} = q v_{r} B_{0} \\Big(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\Big)^{n} r $$  Rearranging terms and integrating yields:  $$ d L - \\frac{q B_{0}}{r_{0}^{n}} r^{n+1} d r = 0 \\to L - \\frac{q B_{0}}{(n+2) r_{0}^{n}} r^{n+2} = C = \\frac{n+1}{n+2} q B_{0} r_{0}^{2} $$  (Conservation quantity 6 points)  Thus, we obtain the function of angular momentum and $r$:  $$ L = L(r) = \\frac{q B_{0}}{n+2} \\biggl(\\frac{r^{n+2}}{r_{0}^{n}} + (n+1) r_{0}^{2}\\biggr) $$  The energy conservation of the charged particle gives:  $$ \\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{r}^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\theta}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{r}^{2} + \\frac{L(r)^{2}}{2m r^{2}} = E $$  (Energy conservation 6 points)  Give the particle a radial perturbation, let $r = r_{0} + \\delta r$, $\\dot{r} = (\\dot{\\delta r})$, resulting in:  $$ \\frac{1}{2} m (\\dot{\\delta r})^{2} + \\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2}}{2m(n+2)^{2}} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(r_{0}+\\delta r)^{n+2}}{r_{0}^{n}} + (n+1) r_{0}^{2}\\right)^{2}}{(r_{0}+\\delta r)^{2}} = E $$  To analyze the oscillation, we need to expand the potential energy and retain terms up to the second order, so we first look at the denominator:  $$ \\begin{array}{r l} &\\left(\\frac{(r_{0}+\\delta r)^{n+2}}{r_{0}^{n}} + (n+1) r_{0}^{2}\\right)^{2} = \\left(r_{0}^{2}\\Bigl(1+\\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}}\\Bigr)^{n+2} + (n+1) r_{0}^{2}\\right)^{2} \\\\ &\\qquad = r_{0}^{4} \\Biggl(1 + (n+2) \\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}} + \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2} \\Bigl(\\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}}\\Bigr)^{2} + (n+1) \\Biggr)^{2} \\\\ &\\qquad = r_{0}^{4} (n+2)^{2} \\Biggl(1 + \\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}} + \\frac{n+1}{2} \\Bigl(\\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}}\\Bigr)^{2} \\Biggr)^{2} = r_{0}^{4} (n+2)^{2} \\left(1 + 2 \\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}} + (n+2) \\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{2} \\end{array} $$  In the above equation, we repeatedly used the small quantity approximation formula $\\begin{array}{r} (1+x)^{n} = 1 + n x + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{2} + \\ldots, \\end{array}$ so the potential energy term can be written as:  $$ \\frac{\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{(r_{0}+\\delta r)^{n+2}}{r_{0}^{n}} + (n+1) r_{0}^{2}\\right)^{2}}{(r_{0}+\\delta r)^{2}} = r_{0}^{2} (n+2)^{2} \\left(1 + 2 \\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}} + (n+2) \\Big(\\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}}\\Big)^{2}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{-2} $$  $$ = r_{0}^{2} (n+2)^{2} \\left(1 + 2 \\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}} + (n+2) \\Big(\\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}}\\Big)^{2}\\right) \\left(1 - 2 \\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}} + 3 \\Big(\\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}}\\Big)^{2}\\right) $$  Thus the second-order terms of potential energy are:  $$ \\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2}}{2m(n+2)^{2}} r_{0}^{2} (n+2)^{2} (n+1) \\bigg(\\frac{\\delta r}{r_{0}}\\bigg)^{2} = \\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2}}{2m} (n+1) \\delta r^{2} $$  (Correctly expanding small terms 12 points)  Thus, the energy conservation equation is:  $$ \\frac{1}{2} m (\\dot{\\delta r})^{2} + \\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2}}{2m} (n+1) \\delta r^{2} = C $$  According to the formula for simple harmonic oscillation, we know this represents an oscillation period of:  $$ T = \\frac{2 \\pi m}{q B_{0} \\sqrt{n+1}} $$", "final_answers": "$$T = \\frac{2\\pi m}{q B_0 \\sqrt{n+1}}$$", "improved_solutions": "1) Brief analysis of each candidate:\n- Candidate 1: Correctly sets up the Lorentz-force equations in polar coordinates, finds the unperturbed circular solution Ω0 = −qB0/m, linearizes, and derives ẍ + (1 + n)Ω0^2 x = 0.

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

These wires are connected at the intersection point. The sphere is placed on the ground so that the circular surface formed by one of the wires is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. It is known that the sphere's center has acquired a velocity \\( v_0 \\) in the horizontal plane, and its initial angular velocity is such that it is in a pure rolling state.

Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical.

Thus the final sign is likely incorrect.\n\n- Candidate 2: Works in the inertial frame, showing the ±m traveling waves have frequencies ω0 ± mΩ due to rotational advection, giving a frequency splitting Δω = 2mΩ. The superposition yields a standing-wave envelope rotating at Ω, hence δω = +Ω. The reasoning is clear and matches the usual rotational Doppler/gyroscopic splitting picture, with the correct magnitude and sign.\n\n- Candidate 3: Similar to Candidate 2 with careful frame discussion and noting independence from material/geometric parameters. Derives ω± = ω0 ∓ mΩ in the rotating frame and shows the standing-wave pattern precesses at δω = Ω. The approach and conclusion are sound.\n\n- Candidate 4: Presents a rigorous modal (2D subspace) gyroscopic formulation with the Coriolis term, yielding ω± = ω0 ± mΩ and a splitting Δ = 2mΩ. From the beat of the counter-propagating waves, the standing-wave antinode orientation evolves with φ̇ = Δ/(2m) = Ω. This is a robust and standard derivation; clear and correct.\n\n- Candidate 5: Uses the advective shift (ω − mΩ)^2 = ω0^2 to get ω± = ω0 ± mΩ and then the beat result δω = Ω. The derivation is concise, physically consistent, and the final answer is correct.\n\n2. Final decision with justification:\nFour out of five candidates (2, 3, 4, and 5) independently arrive at δω = Ω using consistent gyroscopic/rotational Doppler reasoning. This matches the standard mode-splitting result for rotating axisymmetric structures. By the stated rule (majority agreement) and supported by correct physical reasoning, the correct precession rate is δω = Ω in the positive (same) sense as Ω.\n\n3.

{"id": "MECHANICS/654", "questions": "The forty-second batch of Trisolarian immigrants arrived on Earth aboard a spaceship propelled by photons. The spaceship has a rest mass of $M$, and it uses the method of annihilating matter and antimatter to produce photons, which are then emitted directly backward to provide thrust. In the reference frame of the spaceship, the frequency of the photons emitted backward is $ u _{0}$. For simplicity, we assume that the \\\"windward side\\\" of the Trisolarian spaceship is a flat surface with an area $S$. During flight, dust floating in the universe may collide with it. We assume that the cosmic dust is composed of particles with rest mass $m$. For an observer on Earth: the spaceship moves at a constant speed of $v _1$, the particles in the cosmic dust have a speed of $v_2$ and move in the same direction as the spaceship, and the particles in the dust are uniformly distributed with a density of $n$. If, according to the Trisolarian beings on the spaceship, the cosmic dust undergoes a \\\"perfectly elastic collision\\\" upon impact with the spaceship, what is the number $N^{'}$ of photons that need to be emitted backward per unit time in the reference frame of the spaceship to maintain its constant speed?

Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession. Solve for its precession angular frequency $\\Omega$ (the answer can be expressed in terms of $q_{0}$ and $r_{0}$).", "solutions": "According to the problem statement, a single ideal gas under the isothermal model can satisfy the Boltzmann distribution in any continuous potential energy field distribution.

Brief analysis of each candidate:\n- Candidate 1: Derives the plasma charge distribution and the radial electric field correctly and linearizes the UAV dynamics about the circular orbit. Obtains a solid general result for the radial (epicyclic) frequency, Ω^2 = 2ω^2 − (q0/(mε0))ρ(r0). While physically sound and mathematically consistent, the final expression is not solely in terms of q0 and r0 and the final box is truncated.\n\n- Candidate 2: Repeats the correct linearization and field relations but interprets “precession” as the apsidal precession rate, giving Ω = ω − ½√(2ω^2 − …). This is a different quantity than the radial oscillation frequency most others compute; likely a misinterpretation of what the problem asks. Although internally consistent, it does not match the majority interpretation.\n\n- Candidate 3: Derives a general and correct expression in terms of the enclosed line charge q(r) and its derivative, consistent with cylindrical Gauss’s law. However, the boxed final answer simplifies to the special case Ω = √2 ω, which assumes the enclosed charge is locally constant (q′ ≈ 0), making it an approximation rather than the general result.\n\n- Candidate 4: Provides a clear and general expression in terms of q0(r) (enclosed charge per unit height) and r0: Ω^2 = ω^2[2 + (r0/q0)(dq0/dr0)], which is fully consistent with earlier derivations and satisfies the “expressed in terms of q0 and r0” guidance. The final boxed line, however, reduces to the approximate Ω ≈ √2 ω, which is a special case.\n\n- Candidate 5: Offers a concise derivation leading to the epicyclic frequency Ω = √2 ω and an equivalent form Ω = √[−(qU q0)/(π ε0 m r0^2)], assuming the enclosed charge is approximately constant over the small radial excursion. While this involves an approximation, the result matches the majority of the candidates’ final answers and is presented clearly.\n\n2. Final decision and justification:\nMore than half of the candidate solutions (3 out of 5: Candidates 3, 4, and 5) present the same final answer Ω = √2 ω (equivalently Ω = √[−(qU q0)/(π ε0 m r0^2)]). Per the instruction, when a majority agrees, I must select that result. Among these, Candidate 5’s final expression is stated cleanly and directly in terms of q0 and r0 (along with known constants), so I select Candidate 5’s final answer.\n\n3. The selected final answer:\nΩ = √2 ω = √[−(qU q0)/(π ε0 m r0^2)]\n\nSelected Final Answer: Ω = √2 ω = √[−(qU q0)/(π ε0 m r0^2)]"}
