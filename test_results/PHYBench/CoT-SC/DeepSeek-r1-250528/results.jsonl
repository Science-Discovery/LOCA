{"id": "OPTICS/495", "questions": "In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate. This was the first time humanity recognized the relationship between electromagnetic phenomena and light phenomena. The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

The problem's geometry requires the strings to attach to the arc's endpoints (separated by \\(2R\\)), and exceeding this would prevent symmetric oscillation. While energy and tension dynamics are underdeveloped in these solutions, the majority agreement and alignment with the semicircle's physical constraints make \\(2R\\) the most consistent answer."}

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field. The so-called oblate spheroidal coordinate system is similar to spherical coordinates, and it is generated by the following coordinate transformations:\n\n$$\nx= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\cos \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\ny= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\sin \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\nz=a\\mathrm{sh}\\mu\\sin\\nu\n$$  \n\nWe want the shape of the field lines of an electric field or magnetic field to precisely follow its generatrix direction, i.e., the tangent direction of the curve where field strength changes with $\\mu$ while $\\nu,\\varphi$ remain fixed (upwards when $\\relax z>0$). \n\nFind the charge distribution in the $xy$ plane that can produce this electric field distribution. Assume the field strength near the origin is $E_0$. The dielectric constant is $\\varepsilon_{0}$.", "solutions": "First, we determine the equation of the constant-$\\mu$ line. Now, using the trigonometric identity $\\sin^{2}\\nu+\\cos^{2}\\nu=1$, we eliminate the parameter $\\nu$:\n\n$$\n{\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}{\\mathrm{ch}}^{2}\\mu}}+{\\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2}{\\mathrm{sh}}^{2}\\mu}}=1\n$$\n\nIts physical significance is that, for an electric field, it forms a surface of equal potential. This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2).

A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined.

{"id": "OPTICS/498", "questions": "The interference phenomenon in variable refractive index systems is a new issue of concern in the field of optics in recent years.

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

These wires are connected at the intersection point. The sphere is placed on the ground so that the circular surface formed by one of the wires is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field.

What is the subsequent change in velocity?", "solutions": "By noticing that the cutting of the magnetic field by the wire induces an electromotive force, which in turn generates Ampere force and torque, the motion state of the sphere changes. Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution.

Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical. This results in no current through the cross-shaped wires in the center.   \n\nOnly the circular arcs perpendicular to the ${\\pmb x}$ direction have current, with the electromotive force given by:\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-\\pi R^{2}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nThus, the current is:\n\n$$\nI={\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2\\pi R\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nThe $\\pmb{\\mathscr{x}}$ component of the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{x}=I S=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{\\vec{B}}\n$$  \n\nIn the rest frame, the magnetic field rotates at an angular velocity of $-\\alpha$ (referring to the angular velocity of the sphere's rotation).

In the ground frame, we arrive at a remarkably elegant result:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=\\frac{\\pi\\mathcal{R}^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\vec{\\omega}\\times\\vec{B}\n$$  \n\nThis result is remarkably coincidental and symmetric, allowing us to utilize a simple vector method for mechanical analysis.

According to conic section knowledge, the trajectory of the hyperbola to focus $O$ is: $$ r = \\frac{p}{e\\cos\\theta^{\\prime}-1} $$ where $\\theta^{\\prime}$ is the angle between the trajectory of the ball and its polar axis.

To minimize the launch speed $ u_{0}$, and thus minimize energy $E$, $2a$ should be maximized, making $AC$ minimal, satisfying the condition when focus $C$ is at the extended line $OA$ and intersects the asymptote of the hyperbola at point $D$.
