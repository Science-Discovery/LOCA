{"id": "OPTICS/495", "questions": "In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate. This was the first time humanity recognized the relationship between electromagnetic phenomena and light phenomena. The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\). Assume that the medium does not absorb the incident light and its refractive index near the angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) is \\(n\\).", "solutions": "Solution: The propagation of light waves in a medium under an applied magnetic field involves the motion of electrons:\n\\[m\\ddot{\\vec{r}} = -k\\vec{r} - g\\vec{v} - e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\]\n\\(\\vec{E}\\) is the electric field intensity of the incident light wave; \\(\\vec{B}\\) is the magnetic induction intensity applied to the medium; \\(g\\) is the damping term, and since the medium does not absorb the incident light, it exhibits weak damping and low loss, thus neglecting the damping term:\n\\[m\\ddot{\\vec{r}} = -k\\vec{r} - e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\]\nLet \\(\\vec{B}\\) be along the positive \\(z\\)-axis, which is also the propagation direction of the light wave, thus:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nm\\ddot{x} + e\\dot{y}B + kx = -eE_x \\\\\nm\\ddot{y} - e\\dot{x}B + ky = -eE_y\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAssuming the incident wave is a steady-state wave, the relationship between the electric field and time: \\(e^{-i\\omega t}\\)\nThe relationship between the perturbation term of the forced vibration of the outer electrons and time: \\(e^{-i\\omega t}\\)\nThus: \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\equiv -i\\omega\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\equiv -\\omega^2\\), therefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)r_x - i\\omega\\Omega r_y = -\\frac{e}{m}E_x \\\\\n(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)r_y + i\\omega\\Omega r_x = -\\frac{e}{m}E_y\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\\(\\Omega = \\frac{eB}{m}\\), \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\)\n\nFor left-hand circularly polarized light, \\(E_+ = E_x + iE_y\\), then: \\(r_+ = r_x + ir_y\\)\n\\[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega)r_+ = -\\frac{e}{m}E_+\\]\nSolving this, we get:\n\\[r_+ = -\\frac{e}{m(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega)}E_+\\]\nThe polarization vector: The atomic number density of the medium is \\(N(1/m^3)\\), with each atom providing \\(Z\\) electrons weakly bound in the outer layer;\n\\[\\vec{P}_+ = NZ(-e)\\vec{r}_+ = \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega}E_+\\]\nSince \\(P = \\varepsilon_0\\chi E\\), thus:\n\\[\\chi_+ = \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega}\\]\nThe refractive index for left-hand circularly polarized light is:\n\\[n_+^2 = \\varepsilon_+ = (1 + \\chi_+) = 1 + \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega}\\]\n\nFor right-hand circularly polarized light \\(E_- = E_x - iE_y\\), then: \\(r_- = r_x - ir_y\\)\n\\[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega)r_- = -\\frac{e}{m}E_-\\]\nSolving this, we get:\n\\[r_- = -\\frac{e}{m(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega)}E_-\\]\n\\[\\vec{P}_- = NZ(-e)\\vec{r}_- = \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega}E_-\\]\nThus:\n\\[\\chi_- = \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega}\\]\nThe refractive index for right-hand circularly polarized light is:\n\\[n_-^2 = \\varepsilon_- = (1 + \\chi_-) = 1 + \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega}\\]\nThat is, the refractive indices for left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized light are different:\n\\[n_{\\pm}^2 = \\varepsilon_{\\pm} = (1 + \\chi_{\\pm}) = 1 + \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 \\mp \\omega\\Omega}\\]\n\nAny linearly polarized light can be decomposed into two circularly polarized lights with the same frequency, equal amplitude, and a stable phase relationship.

The proportionality coefficient is denoted as $\\alpha$.\n\nNext, we will estimate the coefficient $\\alpha$ based on the classical oscillator model of atoms. In this model, the atomic nucleus can be considered stationary, while the electron, when in motion, is bound by the nucleus. This binding force can be approximated as a linear restoring force: $-m\\omega_{0}^{2}x$.

The stick figure is composed of a head, a torso, two arms, and two legs. Initially, the stick figure is in a state where $\\theta=\\textstyle{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ and $\\varphi={\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$. The head has a mass of $m=0.6\\lambda l$, with the result expressed in terms of $\\lambda$. \n\nThe stick figure is a simulation of a real biological body, so if necessary, the connections between the torso and the arms/legs, in addition to providing interaction forces, can also exert a couple (i.e., a torque), even if there is no interaction force between them. This net torque is independent of the choice of reference point. In the following discussion, this will be referred to simply as a \"couple.\"\n\nDuring a certain free-fall motion, the stick figure, overwhelmed with panic, forgets to bring its legs together and swings its arms and torso with an amplitude of $\\theta_{0}$ (small angle) and an angular frequency of $\\omega$. As a result, its legs passively oscillate near $\\varphi={\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$. Find the amplitude of resonance for the legs (seek the steady-state solution starting from the initial position).

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution.

Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity.

For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. Next, we utilize the following property: the infinitesimal displacement caused by an increase in $\\mu$ between equipotential surfaces is the derivative of the coordinates with respect to $\\mu$:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x=a\\mathrm{sh}\\mu\\cos\\nu\\mathrm{d}\\mu\\quad,\\quad\\mathrm{d}z=a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\\sin\\nu\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\n\nWe proceed to calculate the length of this displacement:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}s={\\sqrt{\\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\\mathrm{d}z^{2}}}=a{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{ch}^{2}\\mu-\\cos^{2}\\nu}}\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the electric potential difference caused by displacements between one ellipse and another. This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2). We obtain the following equation:\n\n$$\n{\\frac{E_{0}a^{2}}{a^{2}+a^{2}\\mathrm{{sh}}^{2}\\mu\\sin^{2}{90^{\\circ}}}}\\cdot a\\mathrm{{ch}}\\mu\\mathrm{{d}}\\mu=E\\cdot a{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{{ch}}^{2}\\mu-\\cos^{2}\\nu}}\\mathrm{{d}}\\mu\n$$\n\nThis gives the distribution of electric field strength.

When the atom is in the ground state, its rest mass is $m_{0}$; when it is in the excited state, due to its intrinsic instability, it will transition to the ground state while emitting photons externally.

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/71", "questions": "Given a particle with charge $q$ and mass $m$ moving in an electric field $\\pmb{E}=E_{x}\\pmb{x}+E_{z}\\pmb{z}$ and a magnetic field $\\pmb{B}=B\\pmb{z}$. The initial conditions are: position $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ and velocity $(v_{\\perp}\\cos\\delta,v_{\\perp}\\sin\\delta,v_{z})$.\n\nWe know that a particle in a uniform magnetic field undergoes circular Larmor gyration, and the center of this rotation is called the guiding center. The drift velocity of this guiding center due to the electric field can be expressed using $\\pmb{E},\\pmb{B}$ and their magnitudes.\n\nProblem: We discuss the case where the magnetic field is uniform, but the electric field is non-uniform. For simplicity, we assume $\\pmb{E}$ is in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction and varies sinusoidally in the $\\pmb{y}$ direction.\n\n$$\n\\pmb{E} \\equiv E_{0}\\cos(k y)\\hat{\\pmb{x}}\n$$\n\nIn reality, such a charge distribution can occur in a plasma during wave propagation. Find the corresponding guiding center drift velocity. It is known that the electric field is very weak, and the particle's initial position is $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$. Approximate to the lowest order that can distinguish from the uniform electric field case.", "solutions": "This problem has been modified; the original problem had four questions.\n\nIf there is an electric field present, we find that the motion of the particle will be a combination of two movements: the normal circular Larmor gyration and a drift towards the center of guidance. We can choose the $\\pmb{x}$ axis along the direction of $\\pmb{E}$, so $\\pmb{E}_{y}=0$, and the velocity components related to transverse components can be treated separately. The equation of motion is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d v}{d t}}=q({\\pmb{E}}+v\\times{\\pmb{B}})\n$$  \n\nIts $\\pmb{z}$ component is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{z}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{z}\n$$  \n\nIntegrating yields  \n\n$$\nv_{\\tau}=\\frac{q E_{z}}{m}t+v_{z0}\n$$  \n\nThis is a simple motion along the direction of $\\pmb{B}$. The transverse components of the previous equation are  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\upsilon_{x}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\upsilon_{y}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\upsilon_{y}}{d t}=0\\pm\\omega_{c}\\upsilon_{x}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{c}\\equiv{\\frac{|g|B}{m}}$ is the Larmor gyration angular frequency. Differentiating these two equations gives  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{x}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})\n$$  \n\nWe can rewrite the above equations as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})=-\\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})\n$$  \n\nTherefore, if we use $\\begin{array}{r}{v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B}}\\end{array}$ instead of ${\\pmb v_{\\pmb y}}$, the equation simplifies to the situation when the electric field is zero. Thus, the two equations can be replaced by  \n\n$$\nv_{x}=v_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{\\mathrm{e}}t+\\delta)}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\upsilon_{y}=-i\\upsilon_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the angle between the component of the particle's initial velocity in the $_{xy}$ plane ${\\pmb v}_{\\bot}$ and the $\\pmb{x}$ axis (counter-clockwise direction). Further integration and taking the real part yields the equations of motion  \n\n$$\nx=x_{0}+\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{\\omega_{c}}\\sin(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)\n$$  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}t+\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{\\omega_{c}}[1-\\cos(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)]\n$$  \n\n$$\nz=\\frac{q E_{z}}{2m}t^{2}+v_{z0}t+z_{0}\n$$  \n\nFrom the equations of motion, it is observed that the Larmor motion of the particle is identical to the case without an electric field, but there is a drift superimposed in the $-y$ direction towards the center of guidance ${\\pmb v}_{{\\pmb g}{\\pmb c}}$ (for $E_{z}>0)$.\n\nTo obtain the general formula for ${\\pmb v}_{{\\pmb g}{\\pmb c}}$, we can solve the equation (1) using vector form. Since we already know that the term $\\textstyle m{\\frac{d v}{d t}}$ only gives rise to circular motion with frequency $\\omega_{c}$, this term can be ignored in equation (1). Thus, equation (1) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{{ E}}+\\pmb{{\\upsilon}}\\times\\pmb{{ B}}=0\n$$  \n\nBy taking the cross product of $\\pmb{B}$ with the above expression, we get  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{E}\\times\\pmb{B}=\\pmb{B}\\times(\\pmb{v}\\times\\pmb{B})=\\pmb{v}\\pmb{B}^{2}-\\pmb{B}(\\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{B})\n$$  \n\nThe transverse component of this equation is  \n\n$$\nv_{\\perp q c}=E\\times B/B^{2}\\equiv v_{E}\n$$  \n\nWe define this transverse component as $\\pmb{v}_{E}$, which is the electric field drift towards the center of guidance.\n\nThe equation of motion for the particle is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d{\\boldsymbol{v}}}{d t}}=q[{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{y}})+{\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times{\\boldsymbol{B}}]\n$$  \n\nDecomposing into scalar form, we have  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{x}=\\frac{q B}{m}v_{y}+\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}(y)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{y}=-\\frac{q B}{m}v_{x}\n$$  \n\nSimplifying yields  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{\\upsilon}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\upsilon_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\frac{\\dot{E}_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\pmb{E_{x}}(\\pmb{y})$ is the electric field at the particle's location. To compute this value, we need to know the particle's trajectory, which is precisely what we attempt to solve initially. If the electric field is weak, as a first approximation, we can estimate $E_{x}(y)$ using the undisturbed trajectory.\n\nThe trajectory in the absence of an electric field is given by  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{r_{L}=\\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{|q|B}}\\end{array}$ is the Larmor gyration radius, and we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)\n$$  \n\nWe seek a solution that is the sum of the gyration at $\\omega_{c}$ and a stationary drift $_{v_{E}}$. Since we are interested in expressing $v_{E}$, we can average over one cycle to eliminate the gyration motion. Thus, the equation yields  \n\n$$\n\\bar{v}_{x}=0\n$$  \n\nIn the above equation, the average of the oscillating term $\\ddot{v}_{y}$ is clearly zero, giving us  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\ddot{v}}}_{y}=0=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\overline{{v}}_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\overline{{\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)}}\n$$  \n\nUpon expanding the small approximation and averaging, we find  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{v}}_{y}=-\\frac{E_{x}(y_{0})}{B}(1-\\frac{1}{4}k^{2}r_{L}^{2})\n$$  \n\nThus, due to non-uniformity, the usual $\\pmb{{E}}\\times\\pmb{{B}}$ drift is modified to  \n\n$$\n\\boxed{v_{E}={\\frac{E\\times B}{B^{2}}}(1-{\\frac{1}{4}}{(k \\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{\\vert{q}\\vert B})}^2)}\n$$  \n\nThe correction term represents the finite Larmor radius effect under the sinusoidal electric field distribution.", "final_answers": "$$\nv_E = \\frac{E \\times B}{B^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left(k \\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q| B}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$", "improved_solutions": "Step–1:  Equations of motion and useful notation  \nThe particle obeys  \nm d v/dt = q(E + v × B),  B = B ẑ ,  E = E0 cos(k y) x̂.  \n\nIntroduce the cyclotron frequency and Larmor radius  \nΩ ≡ qB/m ,  ρL ≡ v⊥/Ω .  \n\nFor a weak, slowly–varying electric field (k ρL ≪ 1 and qE0 ≪ m v⊥Ω) we separate the motion into\n\nr(t) = R(t) + ρ(t) ,  v(t) = Ṙ(t) + ṙρ(t),\n\nwhere ρ is the fast cyclotron orbit (‖ρ‖ = ρL) and R is the guiding–centre coordinate that varies only slowly.  \nFor a uniform B field and to zeroth order in E,  \n\nρx = ρL cosφ , ρy = ρL sinφ, φ = Ωt + δ,  \nṙρ = Ω ẑ × ρ.  \n\nStep–2:  Guiding–centre drift formula  \nTo first order in the small parameter ε ∼ E/B we have for any static electric field\n\nṘ⊥ = (E × B)/B² evaluated at the particle position r = R + ρ,  \nand we must gyro-average over one orbit:\n\nVgc ≡ ⟨Ṙ⊥⟩ = (1/B²) ⟨E(r) × B⟩.

{"id": "MECHANICS/716", "questions": "The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q. A lightweight, smooth-walled insulating thin tube can rotate around a vertical axis through point O in the horizontal plane. At a distance L from point O inside the tube, there is a photoelectric trigger control switch A. A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined. If the distance OB is measured to be $L/2$, determine the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube when the ball is at point B.

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

On its surface at the equator, there are 3 mutually orthogonal wires with negligible mass and thickness and a unit length resistance of \\( \\lambda \\). These wires are connected at the intersection point. The sphere is placed on the ground so that the circular surface formed by one of the wires is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. It is known that the sphere's center has acquired a velocity \\( v_0 \\) in the horizontal plane, and its initial angular velocity is such that it is in a pure rolling state. What is the subsequent change in velocity?", "solutions": "By noticing that the cutting of the magnetic field by the wire induces an electromotive force, which in turn generates Ampere force and torque, the motion state of the sphere changes. Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical. This results in no current through the cross-shaped wires in the center.   \n\nOnly the circular arcs perpendicular to the ${\\pmb x}$ direction have current, with the electromotive force given by:\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-\\pi R^{2}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nThus, the current is:\n\n$$\nI={\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2\\pi R\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nThe $\\pmb{\\mathscr{x}}$ component of the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{x}=I S=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{\\vec{B}}\n$$  \n\nIn the rest frame, the magnetic field rotates at an angular velocity of $-\\alpha$ (referring to the angular velocity of the sphere's rotation).

The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center.

If current flows into endpoint 1 with current I and flows out from endpoint 2:  \n\n$$\nV_{1}^{\\prime}=a_{11}I-a_{12}I,V_{2}^{\\prime}=a_{21}I-a_{22}I\n$$  \n\nAt this moment, the potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2 is:  \n\n$$\nV_{1}^{\\prime}-V_{2}^{\\prime}=(a_{11}-2a_{12}+a_{22})I\n$$  \n\nDue to symmetry, at this moment, the potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2 should be equal to the potential at endpoint 1 (between 1 and 0) when current flows only into endpoint 1 (out from endpoint 0), thus:  \n\n$$\n(a_{11}-2a_{12}+a_{22})I=a_{11}I\n$$  \n\nWe obtain:  \n\n$$\na_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}a_{22}=\\frac{1}{2}R_{2}\n$$  \n\n[This can also be directly obtained by the condition of current input into endpoint 2, where the potential at endpoint 1 is half of that at endpoint 2 due to symmetry.] Similarly, we obtain:  \n\n$$\na_{23}=\\frac{1}{2}R_{2}\n$$  \n\nReturning again to the situation with current flowing only into endpoint 1 (flowing out from endpoint 0), at this moment, the potentials at endpoints 2 and 3 are respectively:  \n\n$$\nV_{2}=a_{21}I,V_{3}=a_{31}I\n$$  \n\nDue to symmetry, the potential difference between endpoints 1 and 2 should be equal to the potential difference between endpoints 3 and 0, thus:  \n\n$$\nV_{1}-V_{2}=V_{3}\n$$  \n\nTherefore:  \n\n$$\na_{11}I-a_{21}I=a_{31}I\n$$  \n\nWe obtain:  \n\n$$\na_{13}=a_{31}=a_{11}-a_{12}=R_{1}-{\\frac{1}{2}}R_{2}\n$$  \n\nNow returning to the required situation of the problem, without loss of generality, we can assume endpoints 3 and 0 are short-circuited and calculate the equivalent resistance between endpoints 1 and 2. In this case, if current flows into endpoint 1 with current I and out from endpoint 2, since endpoints 3 and 0 are short-circuited, there must be current flowing from 0 through the short-circuit wire into endpoint 3. Let the current flowing through the short-circuit wire be $I^{\\prime}$, then it can be considered as the original four-terminal situation with current flowing into endpoint 1, out from endpoint 2, and into endpoint 3 with $I^{\\prime}$. At this moment, the potential at endpoint 3 is:  \n\n$$\nV_{3}=a_{31}I-a_{32}I+a_{33}I^{\\prime}\n$$  \n\nBecause 3 and 0 are practically short-circuited, $V_{3}$ should be 0.

To facilitate subsequent calculations, we establish a cylindrical coordinate system such that the $z$-axis coincides with the symmetry axis of the solenoid. The solenoid extends from the origin along the negative $z$-axis to infinity, and the current is viewed as rotating counterclockwise when observed from above the $z$-axis, meaning the direction of the current is in the positive $\\hat{\\theta}$ direction. Now, a superconducting metal ring is placed such that some constraint keeps the symmetry axis of the current loop always coinciding with the $z$-axis, allowing it to move freely up and down in this state. It is known that at the instant the metal ring transitions from normal to superconducting state, a current $I_{0}$ flows within the ring, and there is no other external magnetic field at a sufficiently far distance from the solenoid. $I_{0}$ flows in the positive $\\hat{\\theta}$ direction.

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession. Solve for its precession angular frequency $\\Omega$ (the answer can be expressed in terms of $q_{0}$ and $r_{0}$).", "solutions": "According to the problem statement, a single ideal gas under the isothermal model can satisfy the Boltzmann distribution in any continuous potential energy field distribution.
