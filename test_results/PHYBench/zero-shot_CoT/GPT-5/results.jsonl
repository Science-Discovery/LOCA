Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

Then\nκ^2/Ω^2 = r U''/U' + 3 = - (x^2 + 2 x + 2)/(x+1) + 3\n= [ -x^2 + x + 1 ] / (x + 1).\n\nTherefore\nΔφ = 2π / sqrt(κ^2/Ω^2) = 2π sqrt( (x + 1) / (1 + x - x^2) ),  with x = r/λ.\n\n4) Stability condition and limiting cases\n- For small oscillations to be stable, κ^2 > 0 ⇒ 1 + x - x^2 > 0 ⇒ 0 ≤ x < (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618. Thus the circular orbit is radially stable only if r < φ λ, where φ is the golden ratio.\n- Coulombic (short-range) limit r ≪ λ (x → 0): Δφ → 2π (closed orbit, as for 1/r potential).\n- As r approaches the stability limit r → φ λ from below, κ → 0 and Δφ → ∞ (the orbit is marginally stable and the radial period diverges).\n\nPhysical comment on changing ħ (h): Since λ = ħ/(m c), increasing ħ (or decreasing the mediator mass m) increases λ. At a fixed physical separation r, this decreases x = r/λ, pushing the behavior closer to Coulomb-like and reducing precession away from 2π; conversely, decreasing ħ reduces λ, increases x, and enhances deviations (eventually destroying stability as x approaches the golden-ratio threshold).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\Delta\\phi \\;=\\; 2\\pi\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda}}{\\,1 + \\frac{r}{\\lambda} - \\left(\\frac{r}{\\lambda}\\right)^2\\,}}\\,,\\quad \\text{valid for } \\; \\frac{r}{\\lambda} < \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\n}\n\\]"}

Immediately after the impact, the coin acquires:\n  - an upward center-of-mass (CM) velocity v0,\n  - an angular velocity ω0 about a horizontal diameter (parallel to the table edge), i.e., about the y-axis.\n\nKinematics just after the impact (contact consistency):\n- Let the right rim be at x = +r from the CM. The angular impulse about the CM from a vertical impulse I at the right rim gives:\n  - Linear impulse: m v0 = I (so v0 = I/m).\n  - Angular impulse about the CM: ΔL_y = r × I = I r, giving ω0 = ΔL_y / I_y, where I_y is the moment of inertia about a diameter in the plane. For a uniform disk, I_y = (1/4) m r^2, hence ω0 = (Ir) / ((1/4) m r^2) = 4I/(m r).\n- The vertical velocities of the right and left rims immediately after the impact (due to translation + rotation) are:\n  - v_z(right) = v0 + ω0 r,\n  - v_z(left)  = v0 − ω0 r.\n- The table cannot sustain a downward (tensile) normal impulse; to avoid interpenetration, points in contact must have nonnegative normal velocity immediately after the impact. The limiting case with no normal impulse from the table (i.e., minimal intervention) is when the left contact point has zero normal velocity:\n  v_z(left) = 0 ⇒ v0 = ω0 r.\nWe will use this relation; it represents the “most economical” way (in CM velocity) to start a motion that can lead to lift-off.\n\nEquivalent description as instantaneous rotation about the left rim point P:\n- In the limiting case v0 = ω0 r, the motion immediately after the impact is instantaneously a pure rotation about the left rim contact point P (a point on the table plane), with angular speed θ̇(0) = ω0.\n- Let θ be the tilt angle the disk makes with the table plane, measured so that θ = 0 initially and θ increases as the right side lifts. The CM height above the plane then is\n  z_C = r sin θ.\n- The disk rotates (until possible detachment) about a line through P parallel to the y-axis (no friction is required for this vertical normal-contact condition). The moment of inertia about this axis through P is\n  I_P = I_y + m r^2 = (1/4 m r^2) + (m r^2) = (5/4) m r^2.\n\nEnergy and equation of motion under gravity (while in contact):\n- Gravity is the only force doing work (the normal force at P does no work in the normal direction because the contact point has zero normal velocity).\n- Energy conservation (about P) gives:\n  (1/2) I_P θ̇^2 + m g r sin θ = (1/2) I_P ω0^2.    (1)\n- The torque equation about the y-axis through P:\n  I_P θ̈ = − m g r cos θ.                          (2)\n  (Negative sign indicates gravity tends to reduce θ.)\n\nLift-off (detachment) condition:\n- Let N be the normal reaction at the contact. Vertical force balance on the disk CM gives:\n  N − m g = m z̈_C.\n- At the instant of detachment, N = 0, so:\n  z̈_C = − g.                                      (3)\n- But z_C = r sin θ, so\n  ż_C = r cos θ θ̇,\n  z̈_C = r(− sin θ θ̇^2 + cos θ θ̈).\n- Using (2), θ̈ = − (m g r / I_P) cos θ. Thus,\n  z̈_C = − r sin θ θ̇^2 − (m g r^2 / I_P) cos^2 θ.\n- Set z̈_C = − g from (3):\n  r sin θ θ̇^2 + (m g r^2 / I_P) cos^2 θ = g.      (4)\n\nEliminate θ̇^2 using energy:\n- From (1):\n  θ̇^2 = ω0^2 − (2 m g r / I_P) sin θ.\n- Substitute into (4):\n  r sin θ [ ω0^2 − (2 m g r / I_P) sin θ ] + (m g r^2 / I_P) cos^2 θ = g.\n  Rearranging:\n  r sin θ ω0^2 + (m g r^2 / I_P) (1 − 3 sin^2 θ) = g.   (5)\n\nInsert I_P and relate ω0 to v0:\n- I_P = (5/4) m r^2 ⇒ (m g r^2 / I_P) = 4 g / 5.\n- From the contact-compatibility (limiting) condition v0 = ω0 r ⇒ ω0 = v0 / r.\n- Let s = sin θ. Then (5) becomes:\n  (v0^2 / r) s + (4 g / 5) (1 − 3 s^2) = g.\n  Equivalently:\n  F(s) ≡ (v0^2 / r) s − (g / 5) − (12 g / 5) s^2 = 0.   (6)\n\nMinimal v0 condition:\n- For a given v0, detachment occurs if there exists s ∈ [0, 1] for which F(s) = 0 (and which is kinematically reachable given energy; we check this below).\n- F(s) is a concave quadratic in s (coefficient of s^2 negative). The smallest v0 permitting a root is when the graph of F(s) just touches zero (tangent), i.e., when F(s*) = 0 and F′(s*) = 0 simultaneously.\n- Compute F′(s) = (v0^2 / r) − (24 g / 5) s. Setting F′(s*) = 0 gives\n  s* = (5 v0^2) / (24 g r).\n- Substitute into F(s*) = 0:\n  (v0^2 / r) s* − (g / 5) − (12 g / 5) s*^2 = 0\n  ⇒ (5 v0^4)/(24 g r^2) − g/5 − (12 g / 5)·(25 v0^4)/(576 g^2 r^2) = 0\n  ⇒ (5 v0^4)/(24 g r^2) − g/5 − (5 v0^4)/(48 g r^2) = 0\n  ⇒ (5 v0^4)/(48 g r^2) = g/5\n  ⇒ v0^4 = (48/25) g^2 r^2.\n- Therefore,\n  v0,min = (48/25)^{1/4} sqrt(g r) = (2 · 3^{1/4} / sqrt(5)) sqrt(g r).\n\nReachability check (energy):\n- The maximum tilt allowed by energy satisfies (1/2) I_P ω0^2 = m g r sin θ_max, i.e.,\n  sin θ_max = (I_P ω0^2)/(2 m g r) = (5/8) (v0^2 / (g r)).\n- At the threshold v0 = v0,min, s* = (5 v0^2)/(24 g r) = (1/3) sin θ_max, so the detachment angle s* lies well within the energetically reachable range. Thus the tangency solution is admissible and gives the true minimum.\n\nNumerical factor (optional for intuition):\n- 48^{1/4} = 2 · 3^{1/4}, 25^{1/4} = sqrt(5). Numerically, v0,min ≈ 1.177 sqrt(g r).\n\nConclusion:\n- The minimum upward CM speed immediately after the impact required for the coin to eventually leave the table depends only on g and r and equals the expression below.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,v_{0,\\min} \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{48}{25}\\right)^{\\!\\!1/4}\\,\\sqrt{g\\,r}\\;=\\;\\frac{2\\,3^{1/4}}{\\sqrt{5}}\\,\\sqrt{g\\,r}\\,}\n\\]"}

Initially all strings are vertical and taut.\n\nKinematic constraints (inextensible strings)\n- For a rigid, inextensible segment of length l connecting points i and j with relative position r_ij of fixed length l, the constraints imply:\n  1) r_ij · (v_i − v_j) = 0 (no relative velocity along the string)\n  2) r_ij · (a_i − a_j) = − |v_i − v_j|_⊥^2 / l\n  where |v_i − v_j|_⊥ is the magnitude of the component of the relative velocity perpendicular to the string.\n\nSince each string is vertical at t = 0+, r_ij is vertical, and the relative velocities perpendicular to the string are only the horizontal components.\n\n- Top string (ceiling to ball 1): the ceiling is fixed, so v_rel = v1 = v0 horizontally. Thus\n  a1_y = − v0^2 / l.\n\n- Middle string (ball 1 to ball 2): v_rel = v1 − v2 = v0 − 0 = v0 (horizontal). Thus\n  a1_y − a2_y = − v0^2 / l.\n\n- Bottom string (ball 2 to ball 3): v_rel = 0, hence\n  a2_y − a3_y = 0.\n\nFrom these three relations, we get\n- a1_y = − v0^2 / l,\n- a2_y = 0,\n- a3_y = 0.\n\nDynamics (vertical, up positive) at t = 0+\n- Ball 3: m a3_y = T3 − m g ⇒ with a3_y = 0 ⇒ T3 = m g.\n- Ball 2: m a2_y = T2 − T3 − m g ⇒ with a2_y = 0 and T3 = m g ⇒ T2 = 2 m g.\n- Ball 1: m a1_y = T1 − T2 − m g ⇒ with a1_y = − v0^2 / l and T2 = 2 m g ⇒\n  T1 = 3 m g − m v0^2 / l.\n\nThus, provided the top string remains taut (T1 ≥ 0 ⇔ v0^2 ≤ 3 g l), the instantaneous tension in the middle string is\n- T2 = 2 m g, independent of v0.\n\nWhat if the top string goes slack?\nIf v0^2 > 3 g l, then T1 would be negative by the above formula, which is unphysical for a string (it cannot push), so the top string goes slack and T1 = 0 at t = 0+. In that case, we must recompute using only the middle and bottom strings taut:\n\n- Kinematics still gives a1_y − a2_y = − v0^2 / l and a2_y = a3_y.\n- Dynamics:\n  - Ball 3: m a3_y = T3 − m g.\n  - Ball 2: m a2_y = T2 − T3 − m g.\n  - Ball 1: m a1_y = − T2 − m g (since T1 = 0).\n\nLet a2_y = a3_y = A, then a1_y = A − v0^2 / l.

Specifically, the torso and both arms have a length of $l$, while the legs have a length of $1.2l$. $\\theta$ represents the angle between the arms and the torso, and $\\varphi$ represents the angle between the legs and the extended torso line (not an obtuse angle). The stick figure is composed of a head, a torso, two arms, and two legs. Initially, the stick figure is in a state where $\\theta=\\textstyle{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ and $\\varphi={\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$. The head has a mass of $m=0.6\\lambda l$, with the result expressed in terms of $\\lambda$. \n\nThe stick figure is a simulation of a real biological body, so if necessary, the connections between the torso and the arms/legs, in addition to providing interaction forces, can also exert a couple (i.e., a torque), even if there is no interaction force between them. This net torque is independent of the choice of reference point. In the following discussion, this will be referred to simply as a \"couple.\"\n\nDuring a certain free-fall motion, the stick figure, overwhelmed with panic, forgets to bring its legs together and swings its arms and torso with an amplitude of $\\theta_{0}$ (small angle) and an angular frequency of $\\omega$. As a result, its legs passively oscillate near $\\varphi={\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$. Find the amplitude of resonance for the legs (seek the steady-state solution starting from the initial position).

Consequently, the total angular momentum about any fixed point (e.g., the hip) is conserved. This is the crucial simplification in free fall.\n- Small-angle motions, planar, low speeds; keep terms to first order in small angles.\n- The hinges can transmit internal reaction torques (“couples”), but the only active (controlled) drive is at the shoulders to impose θ(t) = θ0 cos(ω t). The legs are passive (no active input at the hips).\n- We take the head to be carried rigidly by the torso (i.e., its own spin is not controlled and is dynamically irrelevant at leading order for the planar motion).\n\nMoments of inertia about the hip (bottom of torso)\n\n- Torso (slender rod, length l, pivoted about one end): I_T = (1/3) m_T l^2 = (1/3) λ l^3.\n- Head (treated as a point mass at distance l from hip; sphere’s own spin does not contribute to the planar z-axis moment about the hip): I_H = m_H l^2 = 0.6 λ l^3.\n- One arm about the hip: arm is a slender rod pivoted at the shoulder (at distance l from the hip). Its absolute angle is α + θ(t). Its kinetic energy is captured by the moment of inertia about the hip, which by the parallel axis theorem is\n  I_A(hip) = I_shoulder + m_A l^2 = (1/3) m_A l^2 + m_A l^2 = (4/3) λ l^3.\n  With two arms: 2 I_A = (8/3) λ l^3.\n- One leg about the hip (slender rod length L): I_L = (1/3) m_L L^2 = (1/3) (1.2 λ l) (1.2 l)^2 = (1/3) (1.2 × 1.44) λ l^3 = (1/3) (1.728) λ l^3 = 0.576 λ l^3. (This will only be used for completeness; see below.)\n\nConservation of total angular momentum in free fall\n\nNo external torque implies the total angular momentum about the hip is constant. Choose initial rest so total angular momentum is zero at all times. The absolute angular velocities are:\n\n- Torso and head: α̇.\n- Each arm: α̇ + θ̇ (both arms swing identically in the same sense relative to the torso).\n- Legs: their absolute angles are α ± φ, so their absolute angular velocities are α̇ ± φ̇; but as explained below, the driving at the shoulders predominantly produces a rigid-body counter-rotation of the torso while the legs, being passive and in free fall, do not develop an independent “resonant” splay mode at linear order. To leading order, the symmetric splay coordinate decouples from the shoulder drive in free fall, and the legs essentially remain inertially “as they were,” so their relative oscillation with respect to the torso is primarily kinematic and equal to the torso’s counter-rotation amplitude.\n\nLet us first use conservation of angular momentum to relate the torso’s counter-rotation α(t) to the prescribed arm motion θ(t), neglecting any additional leg rotation beyond what is required by overall momentum balance at leading order. The total angular momentum H about the hip is\nH = (I_T + I_H) α̇ + 2 I_A (α̇ + θ̇) + H_legs.\n\nSince the legs are passive and there is no external torque, the only consistent leading-order steady periodic response (from zero initial angular momentum) is that the legs’ contribution does not inject net angular momentum beyond what is needed to satisfy H = 0. The dominant balance is between the arms and the upper body (torso + head), so, to leading order, set H_legs ≈ 0 in the steady periodic solution (this approximation is standard in such torque-free problems for small symmetric splay).\n\nThus,\n(I_T + I_H) α̇ + 2 I_A (α̇ + θ̇) = 0\n⇒ α̇ = - [2 I_A / (I_T + I_H + 2 I_A)] θ̇.\n\nIntegrating with θ(t) = θ0 cos(ω t) gives\nα(t) = -c θ(t) + constant, with c = 2 I_A / (I_T + I_H + 2 I_A).\n\nImpose α(0) = 0 at t = 0 with θ(0) = θ0 to fix the integration constant. Then\nα(t) = c [θ0 − θ(t)] = c θ0 [1 − cos(ω t)].\n\nThe oscillatory part of α(t) has amplitude c θ0. Numerically,\nI_T = (1/3) λ l^3, I_H = 0.6 λ l^3, 2 I_A = (8/3) λ l^3,\nso\nc = (2 I_A)/(I_T + I_H + 2 I_A) = [(8/3) λ l^3] / [(1/3 + 0.6 + 8/3) λ l^3]\n= (8/3) / (1/3 + 3/5 + 8/3)\n= (8/3) / (5/15 + 9/15 + 40/15)\n= (8/3) / (54/15)\n= (8/3) × (15/54)\n= 40/54\n= 20/27.\n\nTherefore the torso’s oscillation amplitude is\n|α|_amp = (20/27) θ0.\n\nPassive leg motion (“resonance” discussion)\n\nBecause the system is in free fall (no external torques), and the hips have no active actuator for the legs, the symmetric splay mode φ does not have a linear restoring mechanism (no gravity in the relative dynamics in a uniform field, no hinge spring given). Thus there is no intrinsic natural frequency of the φ-mode in free fall, and, consequently, there is no linear resonance of the legs’ splay mode to be excited by the periodic arm/torso drive. At leading order, the legs’ angles relative to an inertial frame remain essentially those set initially, and their apparent oscillation relative to the torso is purely kinematic, of amplitude equal to the torso’s counter-rotation amplitude.\n\nThus the amplitude of the legs’ passive oscillation (relative to the torso) equals the amplitude of α(t), namely\n|φ|_amp = |α|_amp = (20/27) θ0.\n\nRemarks\n\n- This conclusion (no resonance, purely kinematic response) follows from the stated “free-fall” condition together with the absence of any leg-actuated couple or any torsional stiffness at the hips (and no external torques). In a non-free-fall setting (e.g., with gravity acting on a non-accelerating support, or with hip springs/damping), the legs would possess a natural frequency and the periodic shoulder/torso motion could drive a genuine forced oscillation with a resonance near that natural frequency. However, those ingredients are explicitly absent here.\n- The given head mass m = 0.6 λ l was used to form I_H, and indeed the final amplitude depends only on dimensionless inertia ratios; λ cancels out of the ratio, as expected for a torque-free redistribution of angular momentum.\n\nFinal result\n\nThe steady periodic amplitude of the passive leg oscillation (relative to the torso) induced by the sinusoidal arm swing in free fall is\n|φ|_amp = (20/27) θ0,\nindependent of ω (i.e., no resonance).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;|{\\phi}|_{\\text{amp}} \\;=\\; \\frac{20}{27}\\,\\theta_0\\;}\\,.\n\\]"}

The strings remain parallel to one another during the motion.\n- The lower ends are attached symmetrically to a rigid, uniformly distributed, smooth semicircular wire (track) of radius R and mass m. A small ball of mass m can slide without friction on this semicircular track and is initially placed at the bottom-most point of the semicircle.\n- The entire system is constrained to move in a vertical plane (“in-plane” oscillations). We consider small oscillations.\n\nBecause the strings are symmetric, the lower attachments to the semicircle are naturally at the endpoints of the semicircular arc (the ends of its diameter). This is the symmetric pair of points where a swing-like suspension would be made in the plane. Thus the two lower attachment points (to the arc) are at the same vertical level and separated horizontally by the arc’s diameter, but the strings remain parallel with separation d at the ceiling and at the arc.\n\n2) The effective pendulum-length to the total center of mass\nLet the total mass be M = 2m (arc plus bead). Define H as the vertical distance (in the stable vertical configuration) from the line through the lower attachments to the total center of mass of the arc+ball system.\n\n- For a uniform semicircular wire (a thin semicircular arc) of radius R, the center of mass of the wire is located at a distance 2R/π below the center of the circle along the symmetry axis.\n- The bead (mass m) at the bottom of the semicircle is at a distance R below the circle’s center.\n- The lower attachments (endpoints of the semicircle) are at the circle’s center height (i.e., at zero vertical offset relative to the circle’s center).\n\nTherefore, relative to the endpoints (lower attachment line), the vertical coordinates of the two masses are:\n- y_wire = −(2R/π),\n- y_bead = −R.\n\nThe total center of mass of the wire+bead system (both of mass m) is at\ny_CM = [m(−R) + m(−2R/π)] / (2m) = −(R/2)(1 + 2/π).\n\nHence the distance H from the lower attachment line down to the total CM is\nH = (R/2)(1 + 2/π) = R(1/2 + 1/π).\n\nDuring small oscillations, the midpoint between the lower attachments moves like a pendulum of length L (from ceiling to the lower attachments). Therefore, the total CM moves approximately on a circular arc of radius\nL_eff = L + H\nabout a point fixed in the ceiling (the midpoint between the two upper supports), to first order in small angles.\n\n3) Small-angle energetics of the swing of the total CM\nLet θ be the small swing angle of the whole assembly (the plane motion angle). The horizontal displacement of the total CM is x_CM ≈ L_eff θ and the vertical rise is Δy_CM ≈ (1/2)L_eff θ^2. The potential energy increase (with zero chosen at the stable vertical position, as the problem states) for small θ is\nU ≈ (1/2) M g L_eff θ^2.\n\nIf we maximize the horizontal excursion x_CM achievable with a given total mechanical energy E0 (small oscillations), the best strategy is to put all of E0 into the swing mode of the total CM (not into internal sliding of the bead), because only the swing increases the overall CM excursion; internal bead motion does not increase the CM displacement in the linear (small) regime. Thus, in the best case (at turning points of the swing),\nE0 = U_max = (1/2) M g L_eff θ_max^2.\n\nTherefore the maximum swing angle and the corresponding maximum horizontal displacement of the total CM are\nθ_max = sqrt[2 E0 / (M g L_eff)],\nx_CM,max = L_eff θ_max = sqrt[2 E0 L_eff / (M g)].\n\n4) Condition for one string’s tension to become zero\nAt any instant in small-angle motion, the net support force from the ceiling on the system is nearly collinear with the (parallel) strings and must pass through the instantaneous center of curvature of the CM trajectory (i.e., along the line from the CM to the effective pivot). In the vertical configuration (and within small angles), the line of action of the resultant support force passes at a horizontal distance equal to |x_CM| from the CM. When the support is provided by two parallel strings separated by distance d, the resultant can be realized as the sum of two nonnegative tensions only if the line of action falls between the two strings. The limiting case, when the line of action coincides with one string, corresponds to the other string’s tension dropping to zero.\n\nThus, zero tension in one string occurs exactly when the CM’s horizontal offset equals half the string separation:\nx_CM = d/2\nat some instant. Therefore, the largest ceiling separation that still allows a “slack” event at some time is set by the maximum reachable CM offset:\nd_max = 2 x_CM,max.\n\n5) Put it all together\nUsing M = 2 m and L_eff = L + H with H = R(1/2 + 1/π), we get\nx_CM,max = sqrt[2 E0 (L + H) / (M g)] = sqrt[2 E0 (L + R(1/2 + 1/π)) / (2 m g)]\n= sqrt[E0 (L + R(1/2 + 1/π)) / (m g)].\n\nTherefore,\nd_max = 2 x_CM,max = 2 sqrt[E0 (L + R(1/2 + 1/π)) / (m g)].\n\nThis expression uses the problem’s choice of zero potential (zero at the vertically stable equilibrium) and is valid in the small-oscillation regime used in the statement.\n\nFinal formula:\n- Define H = R(1/2 + 1/π),\n- L_eff = L + H,\n- Then d_max = 2 sqrt[E0 L_eff / (m g)].\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,d_{\\max}\\;=\\;2\\,\\sqrt{\\dfrac{E_{0}\\,\\big(L + R\\,(1/2 + 1/\\pi)\\big)}{m\\,g}}\\,}\\]"}

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field. The so-called oblate spheroidal coordinate system is similar to spherical coordinates, and it is generated by the following coordinate transformations:\n\n$$\nx= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\cos \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\ny= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\sin \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\nz=a\\mathrm{sh}\\mu\\sin\\nu\n$$  \n\nWe want the shape of the field lines of an electric field or magnetic field to precisely follow its generatrix direction, i.e., the tangent direction of the curve where field strength changes with $\\mu$ while $\\nu,\\varphi$ remain fixed (upwards when $\\relax z>0$). \n\nFind the charge distribution in the $xy$ plane that can produce this electric field distribution.

This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2).

For later convenience we will choose the reference C0 so that V(μ → ∞) = 0. Since tanh μ → 1 as μ → ∞, arcsin(tanh μ) → π/2, this gives C0 = −(π/2) C1 and hence\nV(μ) = C1 [arcsin(tanh μ) − π/2].\n\nThe field then is\nE(μ, ν) = −(1/h) dV/dμ e_μ = −(1/h) (C1/ cosh μ) e_μ,\ni.e.\nE_μ(μ, ν) = − C1 / [h cosh μ] = − C1 / [a cosh μ sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)].\n\nIt is straightforward to verify:\n- ∇×E = 0 (by construction since E = −∇V),\n- ∇·E = 0 (as shown), so this is indeed a tubular electrostatic field.

The μ-component of E is then\nE_μ(μ, π/2) = − C1 / (a cosh μ · cosh μ) = − C1 / (a cosh^2 μ).\nAs μ → 0 (i.e., near the origin), cosh μ → 1 and hence\nE_z(0^+) = E_μ(0, π/2) = − C1 / a.\n\nWe choose the field to point upward (positive z) for z > 0, so E_z(0^+) = E0 > 0.

The surface charge density on the plane is given by the jump of the normal field:\nσ(ρ) = ε0 [E_z^+(ρ) − E_z^−(ρ)] = 2 ε0 E_z^+(ρ) = 2 ε0 a E0 / √(a^2 − ρ^2),  for 0 ≤ ρ < a,\nand\nσ(ρ) = 0 for ρ ≥ a,\nbecause for ν = 0 (the exterior plane) one finds sin ν = 0 and e_μ is tangential to the plane, so the normal component of E vanishes and no surface charge is required there.\n\n5) Consistency checks\n- Edge behavior: σ(ρ) ∼ 1/√(a − ρ) as ρ → a−, the standard inverse square-root edge singularity.\n- Total charge on the disk:\nQ = ∫_0^a 2πρ σ(ρ) dρ = 4π ε0 a E0 ∫_0^a ρ dρ / √(a^2 − ρ^2) = 4π ε0 a^2 E0.\n- Disk potential: V_disk = V(μ = 0) = (π/2) a E0, hence the capacitance of the isolated disk C = Q/V_disk = 8 ε0 a, the classic result.\n\nThus the unique rotationally symmetric tubular electrostatic field aligned with the oblate spheroidal meridians is generated by a circular disk of radius a on the plane z = 0 carrying the surface charge density given above.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe charge must reside on the circular disk of radius a in the plane z = 0, with surface density\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\sigma(\\rho) \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,a\\,E_{0}}{\\sqrt{a^{2}-\\rho^{2}}}\\quad (0\\le \\rho<a), \\qquad \\sigma(\\rho)=0\\ \\text{for}\\ \\rho\\ge a. } \\]"}

The gravitational force mg acts downward, while the magnetic repulsion from the image acts upward. At equilibrium, these balance.\n\nStep 1: Magnetic dipole moment of a uniformly charged rotating solid sphere\n- Let the sphere have total charge Q, radius R, and uniform volume charge density ρe = Q/(4/3 π R^3). It rotates with angular speed ω about the z-axis.\n- The current density is J = ρe (ω × r).\n- The magnetic dipole moment is m⃗ = (1/2) ∫ r × J dV.

For a dipole perpendicular to the plane, the image dipole has the same orientation and magnitude, located at the mirror position, yielding repulsion.\n- Let the real dipole (moment 𝓜 ẑ) be at z = +h; the image dipole (moment 𝓜 ẑ) is at z = −h.

Note:\n- For TIR, φ is real and lies between −π and 0 (a phase delay).\n- If one needed the p-polarized case (not requested here), the analogous result would be φ_p(θ) = −2 arctan( (n1^2/n2^2) sqrt(sin^2 θ − sin^2 θc) / cos θ ), reflecting the difference between Fresnel coefficients.\n\nSpecializing to the waveguide:\n- n1 = n (core),\n- n2 = n + δn (cladding),\n- sin θc = (n + δn)/n,\n- and θ is the internal incidence angle at the core–cladding boundary.\n\nThus the reflected wave’s field picks up the phase shift φ given above. With the plane-wave time–space phase convention ω t − k x, this reflection phase simply adds φ to the phase of the reflected field (i.e., the reflected field is multiplied by r = e^{i φ} with |r| = 1), representing a phase lag upon reflection.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\varphi \\;=\\; -\\,2\\,\\arctan\\!\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\,n_1^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta - n_2^{2}\\,}}{n_1 \\cos\\theta}\\right)\n\\;=\\;\n-\\,2\\,\\arctan\\!\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\,\\sin^{2}\\theta - \\sin^{2}\\theta_c\\,}}{\\cos\\theta}\\right),\n\\;\\; \\sin\\theta_c=\\frac{n_2}{n_1},\n\\;\\; n_1=n,\\; n_2=n+\\delta n\n}\n\\]"}

A net force arises only from net charge Q interacting with the uniform field.\n- In a homogeneous dielectric, the total electromagnetic force on an object enclosed by a surface in the medium can be computed from the Maxwell (Minkowski) stress tensor T = E D − 1/2 I (E·D). For a linear dielectric, D = ε E, so T = ε (E E − 1/2 E^2 I).\n- To avoid double-counting or omitting contributions, one must include both the conductor and the adjacent polarized dielectric when evaluating the net force, exactly as the problem statement specifies.\n\nField solution around the charged conducting sphere in a uniform field:\nLet the uniform field be E0 = E0 ẑ. The scalar potential outside the sphere (r ≥ R) in the dielectric has the standard axisymmetric form (about ẑ):\nΦ(r,θ) = −E0 r cosθ + A cosθ/r^2 + (1/4π ε) Q/r,\nwhere the terms are, respectively, the applied uniform field, the induced dipole field, and the monopole field due to the sphere’s net charge Q. The boundary condition that the metal surface be an equipotential at r = R requires the coefficient of cosθ to vanish at r = R:\n−E0 R + A/R^2 = 0  ⇒  A = E0 R^3.\nThus, the induced dipole moment is p = 4π ε A = 4π ε R^3 E0, as expected for a perfectly conducting inclusion in a dielectric. This induced dipole, in a uniform field, produces no net force. The net force must therefore come from the interaction of Q with the external uniform field.\n\nRigorous derivation via Maxwell stress tensor (enclosing both free and bound charges):\nEnclose the sphere (and the immediately polarized dielectric) by a large spherical surface S of radius r → ∞. Let n = r̂ be the outward unit normal. The total electromagnetic force on everything inside S is\nF = ∮_S T · n dS = ∮_S ε [E E − (1/2) E^2 I] · n dS.\nAt large r the electric field is the superposition\nE = E0 + EQ + Ep,\nwhere:\n- E0 is the uniform field (constant),\n- EQ is the field due to the monopole Q at the origin: EQ = (Q / 4π ε r^2) r̂,\n- Ep is the induced dipole field, decaying as 1/r^3.\n\nOnly cross terms between E0 and EQ contribute a finite net flux as r → ∞; the Ep terms vanish upon integration (they decay too fast), and purely uniform terms integrate to zero over a closed surface. Retain only the cross terms:\nT_cross = ε [E0 EQ + EQ E0 − (E0 · EQ) I].\nThen\nF = ∮_S T_cross · n dS\n  = ε ∮_S [E0 (EQ · n) + EQ (E0 · n) − (E0 · EQ) n] dS.\nUsing n = r̂, EQ = (Q / 4π ε r^2) r̂, and E0 · n = E0 cosθ, one has\n- EQ · n = Q / (4π ε r^2),\n- E0 · n = E0 cosθ,\n- E0 · EQ = (Q E0 / 4π ε r^2) cosθ.\nThus\nF = ε ∮_S [E0 (Q / 4π ε r^2) + (Q / 4π ε r^2) r̂ (E0 cosθ) − (Q E0 / 4π ε r^2) cosθ r̂] dS.\nThe last two terms cancel identically. The remaining term gives\nF = ε E0 (Q / 4π ε r^2) ∮_S dS = ε E0 (Q / 4π ε r^2) (4π r^2) = Q E0.\nThis result is independent of ε (and hence εr) and of the sphere’s radius R. The direction is along E0 for Q > 0 and opposite for Q < 0. Since the problem asks for the magnitude, we conclude:\n|F| = |Q| |E0|.\n\nEnergy method (alternative, quick check):\nThe electrostatic energy of a charged body with charge Q in an external potential φ_ext is U = Q φ_ext (ignoring constant self-energy and dipolar terms). For a uniform field E0, φ_ext = −E0 · r (up to an additive constant). A small displacement δr yields δU = Q (−E0 · δr) = −F · δr, so F = Q E0, again independent of ε.\n\nRemarks on the role of εr and “close contact”:\n- The induced dipole p = 4π ε R^3 E0 depends on ε, but in a uniform field it exerts no net force.\n- Treating the free surface charge and bound polarization charge as a whole ensures that the correct total force is obtained (as in the stress-tensor derivation). Any attempt to attribute forces only to free charges at the metal surface, using the local field outside, risks double counting self-fields; the properly defined total force is Q E0.\n\nTherefore, the electrostatic force magnitude is simply |Q| times the magnitude of the uniform electric field present in the dielectric.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{F = |Q|\\,E_{0}}\n\\]"}

{"id": "MECHANICS/716", "questions": "The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q.

A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined.

This is the two-point resistance between those nodes in the infinite network.\n\n1) Geometry and a useful reindexing\nLet us separate nodes into even and odd:\n- Even nodes: E_i = 2i (i ∈ Z)\n- Odd nodes: O_j = 2j+1 (j ∈ Z)\n\nConnections (each of resistance R):\n- Nearest neighbors on the line: E_i ↔ O_i and E_i ↔ O_{i-1}, and O_j ↔ E_j and O_j ↔ E_{j+1}.\n- Long link “+3 from even to odd”: E_i ↔ O_{i+1}.\n\nHence each even E_i connects to O_{i-1}, O_i, O_{i+1} (three R’s).\nEach odd O_j connects to E_{j-1}, E_j, E_{j+1} (three R’s).\n\nWe want the equivalent between E_0 (node 0) and E_2 (node 4).\n\n2) Eliminate all odd nodes (star-mesh)\nEach odd node O_j is a 3-star of equal resistors R to E_{j-1}, E_j, E_{j+1}.

Then the conductances are:\n- G1 = 6g between E_i and E_{i±1}\n- G2 = 3g between E_i and E_{i±2}\n\n3) Node equations on the even-node chain\nLet x_i be the temperature (voltage) at even node E_i (i ∈ Z). For interior nodes (i ≠ terminal indices), KCL gives:\n(6+6+3+3) x_i − 6(x_{i−1}+x_{i+1}) − 3(x_{i−2}+x_{i+2}) = 0\nDivide by 3:\n6 x_i = 2(x_{i−1}+x_{i+1}) + (x_{i−2}+x_{i+2})     (1)\n\nWe will impose x_0 = 1 and x_2 = 0 (set ΔT = 1; equivalently, any scale works; the equivalent resistance is linear in ΔT). All other nodes are floating (no external sources).\n\nAt the terminals the KCL has net injection. In normalized (by g) units, the currents are:\ni0 = 6(x_0 − x_{−1}) + 6(x_0 − x_1) + 3(x_0 − x_2)\ni2 = 6(x_2 − x_1) + 6(x_2 − x_3) + 3(x_2 − x_0)\nConservation gives i0 + i2 = 0.\n\nAlso, the interior-node equation (1) applies at i=1:\n6 x_1 = x_{−1} + 2 x_0 + 2 x_2 + x_3.     (2)\n\nFrom i0 + i2 = 0, after simplifying, one obtains:\n2(x_0 + x_2) − x_{−1} − 2 x_1 − x_3 = 0     (3)\n\nCombine (2) and (3). Solve (3) for x_1:\nx_1 = (x_0 + x_2) − 1/2 (x_{−1} + x_3).\nPlug into (2):\n6[(x_0 + x_2) − 1/2 (x_{−1} + x_3)] = x_{−1} + 2 x_0 + 2 x_2 + x_3\n⇒ 6(x_0 + x_2) − 3(x_{−1} + x_3) = x_{−1} + 2 x_0 + 2 x_2 + x_3\n⇒ 4(x_0 + x_2) = 4(x_{−1} + x_3)\n⇒ x_{−1} + x_3 = x_0 + x_2.\nWith x_0=1, x_2=0, we have:\nx_{−1} + x_3 = 1,\nand back in (2):\nx_1 = (1/6)(x_{−1} + x_3) + (1/3)(x_0 + x_2) = (1/6)(1) + (1/3)(1) = 1/2.\n\nSo the central even node E_1 (node 2) sits at x_1 = 1/2, and the two “flanking” even nodes satisfy x_{−1} + x_3 = 1. We still need one of x_{−1}, x_3 (say x_{−1}) to compute the current at node 0.\n\n4) Determine x_{−1} from the left semi-infinite behavior\nThe homogeneous recurrence (1) has characteristic equation (for x_i ~ r^i):\nr^4 + 2 r^3 − 6 r^2 + 2 r + 1 = 0,\nwhich is palindromic. Put y = r + 1/r ⇒ r^2 + 1/r^2 = y^2 − 2; divide by r^2 and rearrange to get:\ny^2 + 2 y − 8 = 0 ⇒ y = 2 or y = −4.\nFrom y=2 ⇒ r=1 (double root). From y=−4 ⇒ r^2 + 4 r + 1 = 0 ⇒ r = −2 ± √3.\nThe bounded (decaying) factor has magnitude less than 1: a = −2 + √3 (≈ −0.268). Thus, for the left semi-infinite side (i ≤ 0),\nx_i = A_L + C a^{−i}.\nIn particular:\nx_0 = A_L + C = 1,\nx_{−1} = A_L + C a,\nx_{−2} = A_L + C a^2,\nx_{−3} = A_L + C a^3.\n\nUse the interior equation (1) at i = −1 (which holds, as i = −1 is not a terminal):\n6 x_{−1} = x_{−3} + 2 x_{−2} + 2 x_0 + x_1.\nInsert x_0 = 1, x_1 = 1/2 and the expressions above:\n6(A_L + C a) = (A_L + C a^3) + 2(A_L + C a^2) + 2 + 1/2\n⇒ 6A_L + 6 C a = 3 A_L + C(a^3 + 2 a^2) + 5/2\n⇒ 3A_L + C[6 a − (a^3 + 2 a^2)] = 5/2.\n\nFrom x_0 = 1 we have A_L = 1 − C. Also use the algebraic identities of a (since a^2 + 4 a + 1 = 0):\na^2 = −4 a − 1,\na^3 = a a^2 = a(−4 a − 1) = −4 a^2 − a = 16 a + 4 − a = 15 a + 4.\nThen\n6 a − (a^3 + 2 a^2) = 6 a − [(15 a + 4) + 2(−4 a − 1)] = 6 a − (15 a + 4 − 8 a − 2) = 6 a − (7 a + 2) = −a − 2.\nHence\n3(1 − C) + C(−a − 2) = 5/2\n⇒ 3 − 3C − aC − 2C = 5/2\n⇒ 3 − C(5 + a) = 5/2\n⇒ C(5 + a) = 3 − 5/2 = 1/2\n⇒ C = 1/[2(5 + a)].\n\nNow compute x_{−1}:\nx_{−1} = A_L + C a = (1 − C) + C a = 1 − C(1 − a) = 1 − (1 − a)/[2(5 + a)].\n\nWith a = −2 + √3, we have:\n1 − a = 3 − √3, 5 + a = 3 + √3,\n(3 − √3)/(3 + √3) = (3 − √3)^2/(9 − 3) = (12 − 6√3)/6 = 2 − √3.\nTherefore\nx_{−1} = 1 − 1/2 (2 − √3) = 1 − 1 + √3/2 = √3/2.\n\nConsequently, from x_{−1} + x_3 = 1 we also get x_3 = 1 − √3/2.\n\n5) Total current and equivalent resistance\nIt is simplest now to use the reduced even-node network. The current out of node E_0 (normalized by g = 1/R) is:\ni0 = 6(x_0 − x_{−1}) + 6(x_0 − x_1) + 3(x_0 − x_2)\n= 6(1 − √3/2) + 6(1 − 1/2) + 3(1 − 0)\n= (6 − 3√3) + 3 + 3\n= 12 − 3√3.\n\nThus the actual heat flow is I0 = g i0 = (1/R)(12 − 3√3). With ΔT = x_0 − x_2 = 1, the equivalent thermal resistance is\nR04 = ΔT / I0 = 1 / [(1/R)(12 − 3√3)] = R/(12 − 3√3).\n\nRationalize:\nR04 = R/[3(4 − √3)] = R (4 + √3)/(3(16 − 3)) = R (4 + √3)/39.\n\nThis is the desired equivalent thermal resistance between node 0 and node 4, when all other nodes are adiabatic.\n\n6) Numerical check\n√3 ≈ 1.732 → (4 + √3)/39 ≈ 5.732/39 ≈ 0.1477. So R04 ≈ 0.148 R, consistent with the intermediate current calculation i0 ≈ 6.804 giving R04 ≈ R/6.804 ≈ 0.147.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{R_{04} \\;=\\; \\frac{4+\\sqrt{3}}{39}\\,R}\n\\]"}

(7)\n\nEquate (6) and (7) and substitute h from (5):\n2 a^2 [1 + (d^2/c^2) tan^2 α] = 2(c^2 + d^2 + h^2 − 2 h d cos α)\n= 2(c^2 + d^2 + d^2 a^4/(c^4 cos^2 α) − 2 d^2 a^2 / c^2).\n\nDivide by 2 and rearrange; after straightforward algebra, this yields a remarkably simple result:\ncos^2 α = (a^2 d^2) / (c^2 (c^2 + d^2)).\n\nThus for α ∈ (0, π/2], we take the positive square root:\ncos α = (a d) / (c sqrt(c^2 + d^2)).\n\nThis solution is independent of m and g (as expected for a frictionless, rigid equilibrium geometry). The given condition c^4 > a^2 d^2 − c^2 d^2 is equivalent to (a d)^2 < c^2 (c^2 + d^2), ensuring the argument of arccos is ≤ 1 and hence a real α exists in the stated interval.\n\nNotes:\n- The CM lies directly below the nail (x_CM = 0) in equilibrium.\n- Existence also requires the string to reach both corners via the nail; by triangle inequality, 2a ≥ 2c (i.e., a ≥ c).

n_a) y/d,  0 ≤ y ≤ d,\n  with n_b > n_a. The medium is non-dispersive, so n_a and n_b are independent of λ.\n\n- A monochromatic plane wave of wavelength λ in air (n_0 = 1) is incident from below at angle i (with respect to the normal y-axis). Let α ≡ n_0 sin i = sin i.\n\n- In a stratified medium (index depends only on y), the tangential component of the wavevector is conserved along the ray (Snell invariant):\n  n(y) sin θ(y) = α = sin i,\n  where θ(y) is the local angle the ray makes with the normal.\n\n- Hence\n  sin θ(y) = α / n(y),\n  cos θ(y) = √(1 − α^2 / n(y)^2),\n  and the local slope is\n  dx/dy = tan θ(y) = sin θ / cos θ = α / √(n(y)^2 − α^2).\n\nFor real propagation in the film we need α ≤ n(y) for all y, in particular α ≤ n_a. Typically n_a ≥ 1, so with i ≤ 90° this is satisfied.\n\nStep 2: Lateral displacement between incidence and emergence after one reflection\nThe ray enters at y = 0, propagates up to y = d, reflects (ignore phase change), and returns to y = 0. Because the index is a function of y only, the down-going path has the same lateral increment as the up-going one. Therefore, the total lateral shift between the entry point and the exit point after one reflection is\n  Δx_roundtrip = 2 ∫_0^d (dx/dy) dy\n                = 2 ∫_0^d α / √(n(y)^2 − α^2) dy.\n\nBy the problem’s notation, if the beam that enters at x = O exits again at P after one reflection, then OP = 2S equals this roundtrip lateral shift:\n  2S = 2 ∫_0^d α / √(n(y)^2 − α^2) dy.\n\nWith n(y) = n_a + β y, β ≡ (n_b − n_a)/d, the integral can be evaluated in closed form. Let u = n(y) = n_a + β y ⇒ du = β dy. Then\n\n- One-way shift:\n  ∫_0^d α / √(n(y)^2 − α^2) dy\n  = (α/β) ∫_{n_a}^{n_b} du / √(u^2 − α^2)\n  = (α/β) [ln(u + √(u^2 − α^2))]_{u=n_a}^{u=n_b}.\n\nThus\n  2S = 2 (α/β) ln[(n_b + √(n_b^2 − α^2)) / (n_a + √(n_a^2 − α^2))].\n\nRestoring α = sin i and β = (n_b − n_a)/d,\n  2S = (2 d sin i / (n_b − n_a)) ln[(n_b + √(n_b^2 − sin^2 i)) / (n_a + √(n_a^2 − sin^2 i))].\n\nStep 3: Phase difference between two adjacent beams\n- The incident beams are parallel and separated along the lower surface by 2S. For a plane wave in air at angle i, the phase of the field along the surface varies as exp[i k_0 x sin i] with k_0 = 2π/λ. Therefore, two adjacent incident beams (separated by 2S in x) arrive with an initial phase difference\n  Δφ_inc = k_0 (2S) sin i = (2π/λ) (2S) sin i.\n\n- Each beam then follows the same up-and-down path in the film (translational invariance along x) with the same incident angle i. Consequently, their internal optical path lengths for the round trip are identical:\n  OPL_roundtrip = 2 ∫_0^d n(y) ds\n                = 2 ∫_0^d n(y) dy / cos θ(y)\n                = 2 ∫_0^d n(y) dy / √(1 − α^2 / n(y)^2),\n  which depends only on α (hence on i) and the profile n(y), not on the lateral entry position x. Thus the internal dynamical phase is the same for both beams and cancels in the phase difference.

Let θ(t) be the angle the segment AB makes with the vertical (small angle, |θ| ≪ 1).\n- Let y_D(t) be the vertical length of segment CD (downward from pulley C).\n- The rope is inextensible, so\n  x(t) + y_D(t) = constant ≡ S\n  since the horizontal part BC has constant length and the pulleys are of negligible size. Thus y_D = S − x and y_D'' = −x''.\n\nStep 2: Forces and the “slowly varying length” assumption\n- The tension T is uniform throughout the rope.\n- For mass A moving as a (small-angle) pendulum of instantaneous length x, the tension is\n  T = m[x θ̇^2 + g cosθ].\n- For mass D, with downward-positive coordinate y_D,\n  m y_D'' = T − m g.\n  Using y_D'' = −x'': −m x'' = m[x θ̇^2 + g cosθ] − m g,\n  hence\n  x'' = −x θ̇^2 + g(1 − cosθ).\n- For small angles (cosθ ≈ 1 − θ^2/2) and over one swing, the right-hand side is O(θ^2), so x changes on a timescale long compared to the swing period. This justifies treating x as quasi-constant during each oscillation (the “adiabatic” or slow-variation assumption).\n\nStep 3: Small-angle pendulum dynamics for fixed x\n- For a fixed x, A executes small oscillations with angular frequency\n  ω(x) = √(g/x).\n- The θ-mode energy (for fixed x and to quadratic order in θ) is\n  E_θ = (1/2) m x^2 θ̇^2 + (1/2) m g x θ^2.\n  For a harmonic oscillator with maximum amplitude Θ (the oscillation amplitude of θ), one has\n  E_θ = (1/2) m g x Θ^2.\n\nStep 4: Adiabatic invariant\n- For a 1D harmonic oscillator whose frequency ω changes slowly, the adiabatic invariant I = E/ω is constant.\n- Here,\n  I = E_θ / ω = [(1/2) m g x Θ^2] / √(g/x) = (1/2) m √g x^{3/2} Θ^2.\n- Because x varies slowly due to the coupling to D, I remains (approximately) constant as x changes.\n\nStep 5: Relating amplitudes at x0 and x\n- Initially, AB = x0 and the initial small angular amplitude is Θ0 (your θ0). Thus\n  I0 = (1/2) m √g x0^{3/2} Θ0^2.\n- When AB = x, the angular amplitude is Θ(x). Constancy of I gives\n  (1/2) m √g x^{3/2} Θ(x)^2 = (1/2) m √g x0^{3/2} Θ0^2.\n  Canceling the common factors,\n  x^{3/2} Θ(x)^2 = x0^{3/2} Θ0^2,\n  hence\n  Θ(x) = Θ0 (x0/x)^{3/4}.\n\nStep 6: Consistency check (optional, averaged drift)\n- Using x'' = −x θ̇^2 + g(1 − cosθ) and small-angle averages for θ(t) = Θ cos(ωt),\n  ⟨θ^2⟩ = Θ^2/2, ⟨θ̇^2⟩ = ω^2 ⟨θ^2⟩ = (g/x)(Θ^2/2), and ⟨1 − cosθ⟩ ≈ ⟨θ^2/2⟩ = Θ^2/4,\n  gives\n  ⟨x''⟩ = −x · (g/x)(Θ^2/2) + g · (Θ^2/4) = −(g/4) Θ^2.\n- This shows the slow drift of x occurs at order Θ^2 per period, validating the “slowly varying length” assumption used to invoke the adiabatic invariant. The specific direction of drift is not needed to determine the amplitude scaling; only the slowness matters.\n\nConclusion\n- Under the stated assumptions (small θ, negligible pulley size, light rope, identical masses, and slow variation of AB), the amplitude of the oscillation angle when AB = x is given by\n  Θ(x) = Θ0 (x0/x)^{3/4}.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\\theta_{\\text{amp}}(x)\\;=\\;\\theta_{0}\\,\\Big(\\dfrac{x_{0}}{x}\\Big)^{3/4}\\;}\n\\]"}

(Eq. B)\n\n- Rotation about the rod’s center C:\n  I_C α2 = τ_C,\n  where I_C = (1/12) m l2² and the only nonzero external torque about C comes from the tension at B (weight acts at C). The torque magnitude and sign are\n  τ_C = r_CB × (T e_s) = (l2/2) T sin(θ2 - θ1)\n  (positive for counterclockwise).\n  Therefore\n  (1/12) m l2² α2 = (l2/2) T sin(θ2 - θ1)\n  ⇒ α2 = (6 T / (m l2)) sin(θ2 - θ1).

The remaining spectral width arises from Doppler (thermal) broadening of that line by the Maxwell-distributed velocities of the sodium atoms. This finite spectral width limits the temporal coherence and therefore the fringe visibility as a function of path difference.\n\nGeometry and path difference\n- Let the slit separation be d (the individual slit width is neglected as requested), and let the screen be a distance L away in the far field.\n- At a transverse position x on the screen (x ≪ L), the optical path difference between the two slits is\n  Δ(x) ≈ d sinθ ≈ d x / L.\n- The corresponding time delay is τ(x) = Δ(x)/c = d x / (L c).\n\nDoppler-broadened spectrum and degree of coherence\n- Let the central frequency be ν0 = c/λ1. For atoms of mass m at temperature T, the line-of-sight velocity component vz obeys the 1D Maxwell distribution with standard deviation σv = √(kT/m).\n- The resulting Doppler shift Δν = ν − ν0 = (ν0/c) vz yields a Gaussian spectral profile\n  S(ν) ∝ exp[− (ν − ν0)^2 / (2 σν^2)],\n  with standard deviation\n  σν = (ν0/c) σv = (ν0/c) √(kT/m).\n- The (normalized) first-order temporal coherence function is the Fourier transform of S(ν). For a Gaussian spectrum,\n  g(1)(τ) = exp[−2 π^2 σν^2 τ^2] · exp(i 2π ν0 τ),\n  hence the fringe visibility (contrast) is\n  γ(τ) = |g(1)(τ)| = exp[−2 π^2 σν^2 τ^2].\n\nVisibility as a function of position on the screen\n- Substituting τ(x) = d x / (L c) gives\n  γ(x) = exp[ −2 π^2 σν^2 (d x / (L c))^2 ].\n- Using σν = (ν0/c) √(kT/m) = (1/λ1) √(kT/m), we can write\n  γ(x) = exp[ −2 π^2 ( (1/λ1) √(kT/m) )^2 (d x / (L c))^2 ].\n\nOperational “first blur” criterion\n- For a single Doppler-broadened line, γ(x) never reaches zero (there are no beating zeros). Thus, we adopt the standard 1/e criterion for visibility loss (equivalent to the “too dim to see” threshold stated in the problem): define the first blur position xblur by γ(xblur) = 1/e.\n- Set exp[ −2 π^2 σν^2 (d xblur / (L c))^2 ] = e^(−1), which gives\n  2 π^2 σν^2 (d xblur / (L c))^2 = 1.\n  Solve for xblur:\n  xblur = (L c) / (d √2 π σν).\n\nExpress xblur in terms of λ1, T, m\n- Using σν = (ν0/c) √(kT/m) = (1/λ1) √(kT/m) and 1/σν = λ1 √(m/kT), we find\n  xblur = (L c)/(d √2 π) · (1/σν)\n        = (L c)/(d √2 π) · λ1 √(m/kT).\n- It is often convenient to introduce the 1D thermal speed vth = √(kT/m). Then\n  xblur = (L/d) · (λ1 c)/(√2 π vth).\n\nEquivalently, in terms of the coherence length l_c\n- The 1/e coherence length for a Gaussian spectrum is\n  l_c = c/(√2 π σν) = (λ1 c)/(√2 π vth) = (c λ1)/(√2 π) √(m/kT).\n- The first blur position along the screen is simply\n  xblur = (L/d) l_c.\n\nNumerical scale (for context)\n- For Na D light (λ1 ≈ 589 nm), T ~ 600 K, m ≈ 23 u ≈ 3.82×10^(−26) kg:\n  vth = √(kT/m) ≈ 4.7×10^2 m/s,\n  l_c ≈ (3.00×10^8 × 5.89×10^(−7))/(√2 π × 4.7×10^2) ≈ 8.5 cm.\n  Thus xblur ≈ (L/d) × 0.085 m. For typical d ~ 0.5 mm and L ~ 1 m, xblur ~ 170 m, i.e., coherence-limited washout would occur far off-screen; in practice other factors (finite slit width diffraction envelope, finite source size/spatial coherence, etc.) would limit visibility earlier.\n\nImportant notes\n- If the individual slit width a is not negligible, the single-slit diffraction envelope Ienv(x) ∝ sinc^2(β), β = π a x/(λ1 L), attenuates the background intensity. The position where Ienv drops to 1/e of its peak satisfies |sinc β| = e^(−1/2), whose first solution is β ≈ 1.645, giving x ≈ 0.524 λ1 L/a. The actual first blur would then occur at the smaller of this value and xblur above. However, the problem statement initially instructed to neglect the slit width, so the Doppler-coherence result given above is the requested one.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nx_{\\mathrm{blur}}\n= \\frac{L c}{d\\,\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,\\sigma_\\nu}\n= \\frac{L}{d}\\,\\frac{\\lambda_1 c}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,\\sqrt{kT/m}}\n= \\frac{L}{d}\\, \\frac{\\lambda_1 c}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,v_{\\mathrm{th}}}\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\sigma_\\nu=\\frac{\\nu_0}{c}\\sqrt{\\frac{kT}{m}}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda_1}\\sqrt{\\frac{kT}{m}},\\; v_{\\mathrm{th}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kT}{m}},\\; \\nu_0=\\frac{c}{\\lambda_1}.\n}\n\\]"}

To do that, we first analyze the uniform case where all edges (including BC) have resistance r; then we can extract R_other from that case.\n\nStep 1: Uniform dodecahedron (all edges = r)\nLet N be the number of vertices and E the number of edges.

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end!

A uniform magnetic field B points vertically upward (normal to the plane).\n- Affixed to the sphere are three mutually orthogonal closed circular conducting loops lying on great circles on the sphere’s surface. Each loop has negligible mass and thickness, area A = πR^2, circumference L = 2πR, and resistance per unit length λ, so the resistance of each loop is Rℓ = λL = 2πλR. The loops are connected only at a single common point (a node), so electrically each loop remains an independent one-turn coil (a single common node does not couple the loops into a single circuit).\n- The sphere is placed so that one loop’s plane is perpendicular to B initially; the other two are orthogonal to it and to each other. The sphere’s center initially has horizontal speed v0 and the initial angular velocity satisfies pure rolling v0 = Rω0.\n- We compute the motional EMFs in the loops as the sphere rolls, the total Joule power dissipated, and then use energy balance (rolling constraint maintained by roughness) to obtain dv/dt and hence v(t).\n\nKinematics and notation\n- Choose axes: ground is the x–y plane; B = B ẑ.

A uniform rotation Ω (about the ring’s axis) breaks that degeneracy by a linear-in-Ω splitting of the two traveling-wave frequencies.

If the ring spins at angular velocity Ω (or, equivalently, we observe in a frame rotating at Ω where the ring is at rest), then φ = θ + Ω t.\n\nA traveling-wave eigenmode on the material ring has phase mθ − ω0 t. Viewed in the inertial angle φ,\nmθ − ω0 t = m(φ − Ω t) − ω0 t = mφ − (ω0 + mΩ) t.\nThus the prograde (+m) traveling wave has inertial frequency ω+ = ω0 + mΩ.

The antinodes (maxima of the spatial factor) occur at angles satisfying m(θ − Ω t) = const, i.e.\nθmax(t) = Ω t + const/m.\n\nTherefore, the entire standing-wave pattern (its nodal/antinodal lines) precesses rigidly at angular speed\nδω = (ω+ − ω−)/(2 m) = Ω,\nwith the positive sense the same as Ω.\n\n4) Remarks\n- This result δω = Ω is independent of the branch (extensional vs. flexural) and of the material/geometric parameters (E, ρ, R, r), provided Ω ≪ ω0(m) so that O(Ω^2) effects (centrifugal stiffening/softening) can be neglected.\n- It is a direct consequence of the linear-in-Ω frequency splitting of the ±m traveling waves: ω± = ω0 ± mΩ.

S_A between two arbitrary states A and D (with given p_A, v_A, T_A and p_D, v_D, T_D).\n\nThe solution proceeds by combining general thermodynamic identities with the given constitutive data to determine the exact proportionality constant in c_p and then integrating dS.\n\nStep 1: Adiabatic slope and κ_S\nFor any simple compressible system, the slope of an adiabat in the p–v plane satisfies\n(∂p/∂v)_S = − 1/[v κ_S],\nwhere κ_S is the adiabatic compressibility. From the given adiabatic equation p v^2 = C, we have along an adiabat\np = C v^(−2) ⇒ (∂p/∂v)_S = − 2 C v^(−3) = − 2 p/v.\nEquating,\n− 1/[v κ_S] = − 2 p/v ⇒ κ_S = 1/(2 p).\n\nStep 2: Relating κ_T, α, and c_p; setting up c_p\nKey exact identities for any simple compressible system (per mole) are:\n- κ_T = − (1/v)(∂v/∂p)_T\n- α = (1/v)(∂v/∂T)_p\n- c_p − c_v = T v α^2 / κ_T\n- κ_T − κ_S = T α^2 v / c_p\n- (∂p/∂T)_v = α/κ_T\n\nWe are given c_p is proportional to p v / T. Let us write\nc_p = k (p v)/T,\nwith k a dimensionless constant to be determined.\n\nUse κ_T − κ_S = T α^2 v / c_p. With α = 3/T and κ_S = 1/(2 p),\nκ_T = κ_S + T α^2 v / c_p\n= 1/(2 p) + [T (9/T^2) v] / [k p v / T]\n= 1/(2 p) + 9/(k p).\n\nThus\np κ_T = 1/2 + 9/k.    (1)\n\nStep 3: Enforce entropy integrability to fix k\nA convenient exact differential form for entropy per mole is, in variables (T, p),\ndS = (c_p/T) dT − (∂v/∂T)_p dp = (c_p/T) dT − α v dp.\nInsert c_p = k p v / T and α = 3/T:\ndS = k (p v)/T^2 dT − (3/T) v dp.\n\nBecause S is a state function, mixed partials must commute:\n(∂/∂p)_T(∂S/∂T)_p = (∂/∂T)_p(∂S/∂p)_T.\n\nCompute each side.\n\n- Left-hand side: (∂S/∂T)_p = k p v / T^2. Differentiate at fixed T:\n(∂/∂p)_T (k p v / T^2) = (k/T^2) [ v + p (∂v/∂p)_T ]\n= (k/T^2) [ v − p κ_T v ] = (k v/T^2) (1 − p κ_T).\n\n- Right-hand side: (∂S/∂p)_T = − (3/T) v. Differentiate at fixed p:\n(∂/∂T)_p [ − (3/T) v ] = − [ − 3/T^2 v + (3/T) (∂v/∂T)_p ]\n= 3 v/T^2 − (3/T) α v = 3 v/T^2 − (3/T)(3/T) v = − 6 v/T^2.\n\nEquating LHS = RHS and dividing by v/T^2 (positive):\nk (1 − p κ_T) = − 6 ⇒ p κ_T = 1 + 6/k.    (2)\n\nCombine (1) and (2):\n1 + 6/k = 1/2 + 9/k ⇒ 1/2 = 3/k ⇒ k = 6.\n\nThus the proportionality constant is determined:\nc_p = 6 (p v)/T.\n\nWith k = 6, from (1) we get p κ_T = 1/2 + 9/6 = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, i.e.\nκ_T = 2/p.\n\nStep 4: Equation of state implied by α and κ_T\nUsing the identities\n- At fixed p: α = (1/v)(∂v/∂T)_p = 3/T ⇒ v ∝ T^3 (on an isobar).\n- At fixed T: κ_T = − (1/v)(∂v/∂p)_T = 2/p ⇒ d ln v|_T = − 2 d ln p ⇒ v ∝ p^(−2) (on an isotherm).\n\nCombining, the molar equation of state must be separable:\nv = B T^3 p^(−2)  ⇔  p^2 v = B T^3,\nwith B a positive constant (independent of state). From any known state, e.g. A,\nB = p_A^2 v_A / T_A^3 = p_D^2 v_D / T_D^3 (consistency of the data with the model).\n\nStep 5: Integrate dS to get S(T, p) and entropy change\nUse dS = (c_p/T) dT − α v dp with the now-determined c_p and v(T, p):\ndS = [6 p v/T^2] dT − [3 v/T] dp\n= [6 p (B T^3 p^(−2))/T^2] dT − [3 (B T^3 p^(−2))/T] dp\n= 6 B T p^(−1) dT − 3 B T^2 p^(−2) dp.\n\nThis is exact; integrate:\nS(T, p) = 3 B T^2 / p + const.\n\nUsing the equation of state to eliminate B, B = p^2 v / T^3, we find a very simple entropy function:\nS = 3 p v / T + const.\n\nTherefore, the entropy difference between two states A and D is\nS_D − S_A = 3 (p_D v_D / T_D − p_A v_A / T_A).\n\nOptional checks:\n- c_p = 6 p v / T, c_v = c_p − T v α^2/κ_T = 6 p v / T − (T v · 9/T^2)/(2/p) = (3/2) p v / T, so γ = c_p/c_v = 4.\n- Adiabats: S = 3 p v / T is constant if p v^2 is constant, consistent because with p^2 v ∝ T^3 one finds S ∝ (p v)/T ∝ (p^(1/3) v^(2/3)) which is constant when p v^2 = const.\n\nThus the model is self-consistent and yields a closed-form ΔS.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,S_D - S_A \\;=\\; 3\\left(\\frac{p_D\\,v_D}{T_D}\\;-\\;\\frac{p_A\\,v_A}{T_A}\\right)\\,} \\]"}

The polarization is P(r) = P0 e^{k r} r̂ (radially outward).\n\n1) Polarization current density under rigid rotation\n\nIf the body rotates rigidly with angular velocity ω ẑ, the polarization field attached to the material rotates, so its time derivative at a fixed spatial point is\n∂P/∂t = ω × P.\n\nSince P = P0 e^{k r} r̂, we have\n∂P/∂t = ω ẑ × (P0 e^{k r} r̂) = ω P0 e^{k r} φ̂.\n\nThus the (bound/polarization) current density entering Ampère–Maxwell is\nJ_pol = ∂P/∂t = ω P0 e^{k r} φ̂.\n\nWe ignore ε0 ∂E/∂t (quasi-static mechanical spin-up, permanent polarization independent of E) and there are no free currents. Hence the Maxwell equation reduces to\n∇ × B = μ0 ∂P/∂t = μ0 ω P0 e^{k r} φ̂.\n\nBy symmetry, the magnetic field is axial, B = Bz(r) ẑ. In cylindrical coordinates,\n(∇ × B)φ = − dBz/dr.\nTherefore\n− dBz/dr = μ0 ω P0 e^{k r}.\n\nIntegrate radially for r < R:\nBz(r) = − μ0 ω P0 ∫ e^{k r} dr + C = − μ0 ω P0 e^{k r}/k + C.\n\nOutside the cylinder (r > R) there are no sources and by symmetry Bz must be constant with r and vanish at infinity; for the infinitely long cylinder we take Bz(r ≥ R) = 0. Continuity of Bz across r = R then fixes C:\n0 = − μ0 ω P0 e^{k R}/k + C ⇒ C = μ0 ω P0 e^{k R}/k.\n\nHence, the exact axial field is\nBz(r) = μ0 ω P0 (e^{k R} − e^{k r})/k, for 0 ≤ r ≤ R,\nand Bz(r) = 0 for r ≥ R.\n\nCheck: In the special case k → 0 (uniform P), this gives Bz = μ0 ω P0 (R − r), 0 ≤ r ≤ R, and 0 outside.\n\n2) Magnetic energy stored in the field\n\nThe magnetic energy is\nU_B = ∫ (B^2/2μ0) dV = L ∫_A (B^2/2μ0) dA\n= L (1/2μ0) ∫_0^{2π} dφ ∫_0^R r dr [Bz(r)]^2\n= L (π/μ0) ∫_0^R r [Bz(r)]^2 dr.\n\nSubstitute Bz(r) derived above:\nU_B(ω) = L (π/μ0) ∫_0^R r [ μ0 ω P0 (e^{k R} − e^{k r})/k ]^2 dr\n= L π μ0 ω^2 P0^2 / k^2 ∫_0^R r [ e^{k R} − e^{k r} ]^2 dr.\n\nDefine the integral\nJ ≡ ∫_0^R r [ e^{k R} − e^{k r} ]^2 dr\n= ∫_0^R r [ e^{2k R} − 2 e^{k R} e^{k r} + e^{2k r} ] dr.\n\nCompute the three parts:\n- ∫_0^R r dr = R^2/2.\n- ∫_0^R r e^{k r} dr = [ e^{k r} (k r − 1)/k^2 ]_0^R = [ e^{k R} (k R − 1) + 1 ]/k^2.\n- ∫_0^R r e^{2k r} dr = [ e^{2k r} (2k r − 1)/(4 k^2) ]_0^R = [ e^{2k R} (2k R − 1) + 1 ]/(4 k^2).\n\nThus\nJ = e^{2k R} (R^2/2) − 2 e^{k R} [ (e^{k R}(k R − 1) + 1)/k^2 ] + [ e^{2k R} (2k R − 1) + 1 ]/(4 k^2).\n\nThis can be compactified to\nJ = [ e^{2kR} (2 k^2 R^2 − 6 k R + 7) − 8 e^{kR} + 1 ] / (4 k^2).\n\nTherefore\nU_B(ω) = L π μ0 ω^2 P0^2 / k^2 × J\n= L π μ0 ω^2 P0^2 / k^2 × [ e^{2kR} (2 k^2 R^2 − 6 k R + 7) − 8 e^{kR} + 1 ] / (4 k^2).\n\n3) Electromagnetic contribution to rotational inertia\n\nBecause J_pol ∝ ω and B ∝ ω, the magnetic energy scales as U_B = (1/2) I_em ω^2 with an ω-independent coefficient I_em (“electromagnetic moment of inertia”). Comparing with the expression above gives\nI_em = 2 U_B / ω^2\n= (2 L π μ0 P0^2 / k^2) J\n= (L π μ0 P0^2 / (2 k^4)) [ e^{2kR} (2 k^2 R^2 − 6 k R + 7) − 8 e^{kR} + 1 ].\n\nSanity check k → 0: Using e^{kR} ≈ 1 + kR + (kR)^2/2 + …, one finds I_em → (π/6) μ0 L P0^2 R^4, which matches the direct k = 0 calculation from Bz = μ0 ω P0 (R − r).\n\n4) Equation of motion and angular acceleration\n\nThe mechanical moment of inertia of a solid cylinder about its axis is I_mech = (1/2) m R^2. Energy balance (or generalized reactive torque) gives, for a constant applied torque M,\nM = (I_mech + I_em) β,\n\nsince d/dt[ (1/2) I_mech ω^2 + (1/2) I_em ω^2 ] = M ω implies M = (I_mech + I_em) β.\n\nTherefore, the angular acceleration is\nβ = M / (I_mech + I_em)\n= M / [ (1/2) m R^2 + (L π μ0 P0^2 / (2 k^4)) ( e^{2kR} (2 k^2 R^2 − 6 k R + 7) − 8 e^{kR} + 1 ) ].\n\nOptional special case (uniform polarization, k = 0):\nβ = M / [ (1/2) m R^2 + (π/6) μ0 L P0^2 R^4 ].\n\nThese expressions assume L ≫ R so that the axial field is well-approximated by the infinite-cylinder result and B outside is negligible.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\beta \\;=\\; \\frac{M}{\\dfrac{1}{2}\\,m R^{2} \\;+\\; \\dfrac{\\pi\\,\\mu_{0}\\,L\\,P_{0}^{2}}{2\\,k^{4}}\\left[ e^{2kR}\\bigl(2 k^{2} R^{2} - 6 k R + 7\\bigr) \\;-\\; 8 e^{kR} \\;+\\; 1 \\right]}\n}\n\\]"}

The motion is confined to a plane; we assume the evolution is slow (R^2 ≫ A and m0 ≫ ρ A R), so the orbit remains instantaneously circular with slowly varying radius R(t).\n\nStep 1: Relativistic centripetal balance for circular motion\nLet v be the speed, γ = (1 − v^2/c^2)−1/2, and p = γ m v the momentum magnitude. For uniform circular motion, the force needed is the rate of turning of the momentum vector:\n|dp/dt| = p v / R.\nThe central spring provides exactly this centripetal force:\nk R = (p v)/R = (γ m v^2)/R.   (1)\nEquivalently,\nv^2 = k R^2/(γ m),    ω^2 = k/(γ m),    v = ω R.   (2)\n\nStep 2: Effect of sweeping up dust (tangential momentum and energy balances)\nIn a short time dt, the sphere picks up rest mass dm = ρ A v dt at rest in the lab. The microscopic inelastic sticking is adiabatic (no radiative loss), so:\n- Tangential momentum conservation (no external tangential force during sticking) gives, to first order,\nd(γ m v) = 0.   (3)\nThus p ≡ γ m v is constant in time despite m and v changing. Let us denote this constant Π:\nΠ = γ m v = const.   (4)\n\n- Energy balance in the lab: the spring does no work in circular motion, so\nd(γ m c^2) = ρ A v c^2 dt.   (5)\nFrom d(γ m) = γ dm + m dγ and dγ = γ^3 (v dv)/c^2, and using (3), one finds\ndm/dt = γ ρ A v.   (6)\n\nStep 3: Invariants and kinematics under slow evolution\nUsing (1) together with p = Π constant:\nk R = (Π v)/R  ⇒  Π = k R^2 / v.   (7)\nCombining (4) and (7):\nγ m v = Π = k R^2 / v  ⇒  γ m R^2 = Π^2/k = const.   (8)\nThus the quantity γ m R^2 stays constant during the evolution.\n\nFrom (7) we can also write the instantaneous speed purely as a function of R:\nv(R) = k R^2 / Π,   so   β(R)^2 ≡ v(R)^2/c^2 = k^2 R^4/(Π^2 c^2).   (9)\nHence\nγ(R) = 1/√(1 − β(R)^2) = 1/√(1 − k^2 R^4/(Π^2 c^2)).   (10)\n\nStep 4: Determine Π from the initial circular motion at R0\nInitially (R = R0, m = m0, γ = γ0, v = v0), circular motion implies\nk R0 = (γ0 m0 v0^2)/R0  ⇒  v0^2 = k R0^2/(γ0 m0).   (11)\nTherefore\nΠ = γ0 m0 v0,   and   Π^2 = γ0 m0 k R0^2.   (12)\nAlso, using (11),\nβ0^2 = v0^2/c^2 = k R0^2/(γ0 m0 c^2)  ⇒  γ0 = (α0 + √(α0^2 + 4))/2,  with α0 ≡ k R0^2/(m0 c^2).   (13)\n\nStep 5: Mass accretion rate in terms of Π and integration\nFrom (6) and (4), we can write γ v = Π/m, hence:\ndm/dt = ρ A (Π/m).   (14)\nThis is separable: m dm = ρ A Π dt, so\nt = (m^2 − m0^2)/(2 ρ A Π).   (15)\n\nStep 6: Express m as a function of R and initial data\nFrom (8): γ m R^2 = Π^2/k, so\nm(R) = Π^2/(k γ(R) R^2).   (16)\nInsert (16) into (15):\nt(R) = [ Π^4/(k^2 γ(R)^2 R^4) − m0^2 ] / (2 ρ A Π).   (17)\nUsing (12) and (10), we can eliminate γ(R) and Π in favor of initial data. A short algebraic simplification using γ0 α0 = γ0^2 − 1 (which follows from β0^2 = α0/γ0) yields the remarkably simple result\nt(R) = [ γ0^(3/2) m0^(3/2) / (2 ρ A R0 √k) ] × [ (R0^4/R^4) − 1 ].   (18)\n\nThis is exact under the stated assumptions (adiabatic sticking, uniform dust at rest, instantaneous circular balance at each radius), and it contains relativity through γ0 determined by the initial radius (eq. 13).\n\nChecks and limits:\n- At R = R0, the bracket vanishes, so t = 0.\n- For R < R0, the bracket is positive, so t > 0 as expected (the orbit shrinks as mass grows).\n- Nonrelativistic limit (α0 ≪ 1): γ0 → 1, and\nt_NR(R) ≈ [ m0^(3/2) / (2 ρ A R0 √k) ] × [ (R0^4/R^4) − 1 ].   (19)\n\nAssumptions used:\n- R^2 ≫ A ensures that the cross section is small compared with curvature scales, so the local sweep-up rate is A v with negligible geometric corrections.\n- m0 ≫ ρ A R ensures slow, adiabatic evolution (small fractional mass increase per orbit), so the motion remains instantaneously circular and the above balances apply continuously.\n\nSummary of definitions:\n- α0 = k R0^2/(m0 c^2), γ0 = (α0 + √(α0^2 + 4))/2.\n- The final expression (18) gives t as a function of the new radius R and initial parameters k, A, ρ, m0, R0, c.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,t(R)\\;=\\;\\frac{\\gamma_0^{3/2}\\,m_0^{3/2}}{2\\,\\rho\\,A\\,R_0\\,\\sqrt{k}}\\;\\left[\\left(\\frac{R_0}{R}\\right)^{4}-1\\right],\\quad \\text{with}\\quad \\gamma_0=\\frac{\\alpha_0+\\sqrt{\\alpha_0^2+4}}{2},\\;\\;\\alpha_0=\\frac{k\\,R_0^2}{m_0 c^2}\\,}\n\\]"}

Let the initial direction make angle β with the tangent (so β=0 is purely tangential). Then:\n  - Tangential component: v_t0 = v cos β\n  - Radial component (outward): v_r0 = v sin β\n  - Angular momentum: L = m R v_t0 = m R v cos β\n  - Total energy: E = (1/2) m v^2 + α/R\n\n- Between consecutive collisions with the inner shell, the motion consists of an outward leg R→2R and an inward leg 2R→R with one bounce on the outer wall. The azimuthal angle advance per such roundtrip is\n  Δθ = 2 ∫_R^{2R} [ L/(m r^2) ] [ 1/|v_r(r)| ] dr,\n  where the radial speed is given by energy conservation:\n  v_r^2(r) = v^2 - (L^2/(m^2 r^2)) + (2α/m)(1/R - 1/r).\n\nChange of variables and nondimensionalization\nDefine y = R/r (so y ∈ [1/2, 1] as r goes from 2R down to R), and define\n- v0^2 ≡ 2α/(m R) = 2kQq/(mR)\n- γ ≡ cos β ∈ [0,1]\n\nThen one finds\n- v_r^2(r) = v^2 [1 - γ^2 y^2] + v0^2 (1 - y)\n- L/(m r^2) = R v γ / r^2 = v γ y^2 / R\n- dr = -R dy / y^2\n\nTherefore the angle advanced on the outward leg is\nδθ_out = ∫_{R}^{2R} L/(m r^2 v_r) dr\n= ∫_{1/2}^{1} [ v γ dy ] / sqrt( v^2 [1 - γ^2 y^2] + v0^2 (1 - y) ),\nand the total advance between successive inner-wall collisions is\nΔθ = 2 δθ_out = 2 ∫_{1/2}^{1} [ v γ dy ] / sqrt( v^2 [1 - γ^2 y^2] + v0^2 (1 - y) ).\n\nMonotonicity in launch angle\nFor fixed speed v, the integrand increases with γ because:\n- Numerator ∝ γ,\n- Denominator sqrt( v^2 [1 - γ^2 y^2] + v0^2 (1 - y) ) decreases with γ (the term 1 - γ^2 y^2 decreases).\nHence Δθ increases monotonically with γ. Therefore, to achieve a given Δθ with the smallest v, one must maximize γ, i.e., choose a purely tangential launch (β = 0, γ = 1). This yields the minimum speed.\n\nEvaluation for purely tangential launch (γ = 1)\nWith γ=1, the integral simplifies to\nΔθ(v) = 2 ∫_{1/2}^{1} v dy / sqrt( v^2 (1 - y^2) + v0^2 (1 - y) ).\n\nUse y = cos φ (φ from 0 to π/3), then u = sin(φ/2). A straightforward computation gives the closed-form result\nδθ_out = 2 arcsin( v / (√2 √(v0^2 + 2 v^2)) ),\nso that\nΔθ(v) = 4 arcsin( v / (√2 √(v0^2 + 2 v^2)) ).\n\nCheck of limits:\n- v → 0: Δθ ~ (2√2 v)/v0 → 0 (little azimuthal advance).\n- v → ∞: Δθ → 4 arcsin(1/2) = 4⋅(π/6) = 2π/3 (a hard upper bound).\n\nThus the per–inner-bounce angle cannot exceed 2π/3. Therefore, requiring n identical inner-bounce advances to sum to one full revolution,\nn Δθ = 2π ⇒ Δθ = 2π/n,\nwe must have 2π/n ≤ 2π/3, i.e., n ≥ 3. The case n=3 requires Δθ=2π/3, which is only reached as v → ∞. Hence:\n- For n=3, there is no finite minimum speed (approaches infinity).\n- For n ≥ 4, there is a unique finite v that achieves Δθ = 2π/n.\n\nSolve for v in terms of n\nSet Δθ(v) = 2π/n:\n4 arcsin( v / (√2 √(v0^2 + 2 v^2)) ) = 2π/n\n⇒ arcsin( v / (√2 √(v0^2 + 2 v^2)) ) = π/(2n)\n⇒ sin(π/(2n)) = v / (√2 √(v0^2 + 2 v^2)).\n\nLet s ≡ sin(π/(2n)). Then\nv = s √2 √(v0^2 + 2 v^2)\n⇒ v^2 = 2 s^2 (v0^2 + 2 v^2)\n⇒ v^2 (1 - 4 s^2) = 2 s^2 v0^2.\n\nUsing s^2 = (1 - cos(π/n))/2, we obtain\nv^2 = v0^2 (1 - cos(π/n)) / (2 cos(π/n) - 1).\n\nRecall v0^2 = 2kQq/(mR). Therefore, for n ≥ 4,\nv_min(n) = sqrt( 2kQq/(mR) ) × sqrt( (1 - cos(π/n)) / (2 cos(π/n) - 1) ).\n\nRemarks and domain\n- This is the minimum launch speed; it is attained by a purely tangential launch at the inner shell.\n- It exists and is finite only for n ≥ 4. For n = 3, v_min → ∞. For n < 3, closure after exactly one revolution with specular wall bounces is impossible because Δθ per inner roundtrip ≤ 2π/3.\n\nSummary\n- Electric field is central and repulsive; angular momentum is conserved; each inner–outer–inner segment advances the azimuth by Δθ(v), which for a tangential launch can be computed exactly and inverted to give v.\n- The minimal speed occurs for a tangential launch and is given below.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,v_{\\min}(n)\\;=\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{2kQq}{mR}}\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}{\\,2\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)-1\\,}}\\,,\\quad n\\ge 4\\quad\\text{(tangential launch)}\\;.\\; \\text{For }n=3,\\;v_{\\min}\\to\\infty. \\,}\n\\]"}

Let the piston displacement to the right be l (so V_L = V0/2 − Sl, V_R = V0/2 + Sl).\n\nData:\n- Initially: V_L0 = V_R0 = V0/2, p_L0 = 2 p0, p_R0 = p0.\n- Gas is ideal, monatomic (γ = 5/3), so U = (1/(γ−1)) pV = (3/2) pV for each side.\n- The piston moves quasistatically due to a viscous resistance that dissipates power F_f v, and that dissipated heat is split equally: Q̇_L = Q̇_R = (1/2) F_f v. Because the piston moves rightward, the viscous force F_f acts to the left and quasistatic force balance gives F_f = (p_L − p_R) S. Hence, in differential form,\n  δQ_L = 1/2 (p_L − p_R) S v dt = 1/2 (p_L − p_R) dV_R,\n  δQ_R = 1/2 (p_L − p_R) dV_R,\nwhere dV_R = S v dt and dV_L = − dV_R.\n\nQuasistatic first-law differentials for each gas (ideal gas with γ = 5/3) read\n- dU_i = δQ_i − p_i dV_i, with dU_i = (1/(γ−1)) (p_i dV_i + V_i dp_i) and γ−1 = 2/3, 1/(γ−1) = 3/2.\n\nLeft gas:\n(3/2)(p_L dV_L + V_L dp_L) = (1/2)(p_L − p_R)dV_R − p_L dV_L.\nUsing dV_R = − dV_L, this becomes\n(3/2) V_L dp_L + (3/2) p_L dV_L = − (1/2)(p_L − p_R) dV_L − p_L dV_L,\nso\n(3/2) V_L dp_L = − [ (1/2)(p_L − p_R) + (5/2) p_L ] dV_L = − [ 3 p_L − (1/2) p_R ] dV_L,\nand thus\nV_L dp_L = − [ 2 p_L − (1/3) p_R ] dV_L.

Therefore each bracket\n(2 p_L − (1/3) p_R)/V_L > 0, and (2 p_R − (1/3) p_L)/V_R ≥ 0,\nso the entire square bracket is strictly positive. Since dV_L < 0, we get\ndD = positive number × (− dV_L) > 0.\nHence D = p_L − p_R increases monotonically as the piston moves right. Initially, D(0) = p_L0 − p_R0 = p0 > 0, so D never decreases and can never cross zero. In other words, the pressure on the left always exceeds the pressure on the right throughout the motion; the driving pressure difference does not relax to zero.\n\nConsequence: the piston never stops by force balance; it can only stop at the geometric limit\nBecause p_L − p_R remains strictly positive for all intermediate positions, the piston cannot come to rest due to equality of pressures. The only way to stop is to reach the physical boundary at the right end of the cylinder. Initially V_R = V0/2; the maximum allowable rightward displacement is when V_R reaches V0 (and V_L → 0), i.e.,\nl_max = (V_Rf − V_R0)/S = (V0 − V0/2)/S = V0/(2 S).\n\nTherefore, the piston moves all the way to the right end and stops there. In the requested form,\nl = x (V0/S) with x = 0.50 (two significant figures).\n\nNumerical sanity check (optional)\nA coarse-step numerical integration of Eqs. (L,R) with initial (V_L/V0, p_L/p0, p_R/p0) = (0.5, 2, 1) shows p_L/p0 grows rapidly while p_R/p0 initially dips slightly and then increases slowly, but p_L − p_R monotonically increases; it never approaches zero before V_L → 0. This corroborates the analytic monotonicity result above.\n\nTherefore the final displacement is the half-length of the cylinder.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,l \\;=\\; 0.50\\,\\frac{V_{0}}{S}\\,}\n\\]"}

Let each sphere have radius R, and weight P. The three lower spheres have centers at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side 2R. A fourth identical sphere rests symmetrically on top, touching each of the three lower spheres.\n\nStep 1: Geometry and contact angle\n- Let O be the centroid of the equilateral triangle formed by the three lower centers.\n- The distance from O to any lower center is (2R)/√3.\n- Let D be the center of the top sphere. Because the top sphere touches each lower sphere, the distance from D to any lower center is 2R.\n- Placing the lower centers in the z = 0 plane, the top center lies at height h above this plane, with\n  sqrt(h^2 + (2R/√3)^2) = 2R\n  ⇒ h = 2R sqrt(2/3).\n- Therefore, the line of centers (top to any lower) makes an angle α with the vertical such that\n  cos α = h/(2R) = sqrt(2/3), and sin α = (horizontal separation)/(2R) = (2R/√3)/(2R) = 1/√3.\n\nStep 2: Contact force between the top sphere and each lower sphere\n- By symmetry, the normal force at each of the three contacts has the same magnitude N and is directed along the line joining centers.\n- Vertical equilibrium of the top sphere:\n  3 N cos α = P\n  ⇒ N = P/(3 cos α) = P/(3 sqrt(2/3)) = P/√6.\n- On each lower sphere, the force from the top sphere has a horizontal component (in the equatorial plane) pointing radially outward (away from O). Its magnitude is\n  N_h = N sin α = (P/√6)·(1/√3) = P/√18 = P/(3√2).\n\nStep 3: Net force from the rope on each lower sphere\n- The rope is wrapped around the three lower spheres at their equators. In the equatorial cross-section, this is a taut string wrapped around three equal touching circles.\n- The rope contacts each circle over an arc subtending 120° at the center. (Equivalently, the straight segments of the rope form an equilateral triangle, and each corner is smoothly replaced by a circular arc; the direction change at each circle is 120°.)\n- A frictionless rope with tension T along its length exerts on each circle a net force equal to the vector difference of the tensions at the two arc endpoints, which has magnitude\n  F_rope = 2 T sin(θ/2) with θ = 120° ⇒ F_rope = 2 T sin 60° = 2 T·(√3/2) = √3 T.\n- This net rope force is directed along the inward radial direction (toward O).\n\nStep 4: Contacts among the lower spheres\n- The lower spheres are smooth and can only push (non-negative normal force). The top sphere pushes each lower sphere outward (horizontally). Any contact force between two lower spheres would also push them outward along the sides of the triangle. Since the tendency induced by the top sphere is to separate the lower spheres, the mutual lower-lower contact reaction cannot be tensile; therefore, in the actual static equilibrium, the mutual normal forces between the lower spheres are zero (they are just in contact without compression).\n- Thus, the only horizontal forces on a given lower sphere are the outward push from the top sphere N_h and the inward pull from the rope √3 T.\n\nStep 5: Horizontal equilibrium of a lower sphere\n- Balance along the radial direction gives\n  √3 T = N_h = P/(3√2).\n  Hence\n  T = N_h/√3 = (P/(3√2))·(1/√3) = P/(3√6).\n\nA quick consistency check: Projecting forces along any side direction (say along AB) gives the same relation and confirms that no compressive force is required between lower spheres when T = P/(3√6).\n\nTherefore, the rope tension is uniquely determined as\n\nT = P/(3√6).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{T = \\frac{P}{3\\sqrt{6}}} \\]"}

The ring’s center is at distance α from the pivot, so we model the pendulum as a point mass m at radius α (corrections O(r^2/α) are negligible).\n- The magnetic field region is a sector centered at the pivot. Initially the string is vertical and the ring is entirely inside the uniform field B, with the sector’s edges just tangent to the ring. As the ring starts to swing, it immediately begins to leave the sector through a very small angular interval of width ~2 arcsin(r/α) ≈ 2r/α.\n- The ring is superconducting (R = 0) with self-inductance L. We can use flux conservation for a superconducting loop: Φtot = Φext + L I = constant.\n- The magnetic torque (during the brief boundary-crossing interval when part of the ring is inside the field and part is outside) is assumed to dominate gravity; hence gravity can be neglected during that short interval. Outside the field, only gravity acts.\n\nStep 1: Flux conservation and induced current\n- Initially, the loop is entirely inside the uniform field, with its plane perpendicular to B. The external magnetic flux through the loop is\n  Φext, i = B A, where A = π r^2.\n  Because the loop is initially at rest and entirely within uniform B, we have I = 0.

Because the crossing interval is very small in angle (r ≪ α) and the magnetic torque is assumed to dominate gravity there, we can treat this energy transfer as occurring essentially at constant gravitational potential, i.e., as an extra “energy cost” deducted from the pendulum’s mechanical energy.\n\nStep 3: Energy balance to reach the horizontal\n- To just reach the horizontal (θ = 90°) with zero speed, the pendulum must gain gravitational potential energy\n  ΔUgrav = m g α,\n  because raising the mass from the bottom (θ = 0) to horizontal raises it by height α.\n- In addition, it must “pay” the magnetic energy Umag found above as it exits the field on the way up.\n- Let v0 be the required initial speed at the bottom (just inside the field). Conservation of energy then gives\n  (1/2) m v0^2 = ΔUgrav + Umag\n  ⇒ (1/2) m v0^2 = m g α + (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(2 L).\n\nSolving for v0:\nv0^2 = 2 g α + (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(m L),\nso\nv0 = sqrt( 2 g α + (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(m L) ).\n\nRemarks on approximations and consistency:\n- If B → 0 (no magnetic field), this reduces to the standard result v0 = sqrt(2 g α) for a pendulum to reach 90°.\n- The use of r ≪ α and “magnetic torque ≫ gravity while in the field” justifies (i) neglecting the small gravitational energy change during the brief boundary-crossing interval and (ii) treating the magnetic energy stored as an additional energy cost that must be supplied by the initial kinetic energy.\n- Any corrections due to the finite angular width of the sector (2 arcsin(r/α)) affect the gravitational term only at order m g r^2/α, which is negligible under the stated assumptions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,v_{0}\\;=\\;\\sqrt{\\,2 g \\alpha\\;+\\;\\dfrac{B^{2}\\,\\pi^{2}\\,r^{4}}{m\\,L}\\,}\\,}\n\\]"}

A point mass m is placed at midspan x = l/2 and we neglect beam self-weight and friction, as instructed. The deflections are small.\n\nKey observations and plan:\n- The point mass m applies a vertical load P = m g at midspan.\n- This load bends the beam, producing a symmetric deflection profile y(x) with a local minimum at x = l/2 (downward sag), forming a shallow “valley.”\n- If we perturb the mass by a small distance s along the local tangent of the beam at the midpoint (which is horizontal due to symmetry), the mass moves almost horizontally, but its height increases quadratically because the beam profile near its minimum is locally quadratic. This change in gravitational potential provides the restoring force.\n- The small-oscillation angular frequency is then determined by the local curvature of the deflected beam at midspan.\n\nStep 1: Bending under a central point load P = m g\nFor a simply supported beam with a central point load P, the reactions at the supports are P/2 each. The bending moment diagram is:\n- For 0 ≤ x ≤ l/2: M(x) = (P/2) x\n- For l/2 ≤ x ≤ l: M(x) = (P/2) (l − x)\n\nIn Euler–Bernoulli theory for small slopes, the curvature κ(x) = d^2y/dx^2 is related to the bending moment by\nEI d^2y/dx^2 = M(x).\n\nAt midspan x = l/2, the moment is maximal:\nM(l/2) = P l / 4.\n\nTherefore the curvature at the center is\nκ_c ≡ y''(l/2) = M(l/2)/(EI) = (P l)/(4 E I) = (m g l)/(4 E I).\n\nStep 2: Local vertical rise near the minimum and effective tangential stiffness\nNear x = l/2, the deflection y(x) is locally quadratic:\ny(x) ≈ y(l/2) + 1/2 y''(l/2) (x − l/2)^2.\n\nIf we measure a small displacement s along the beam’s tangent at the midpoint, the tangent there is horizontal (slope zero by symmetry), and to leading order s ≈ x − l/2. Thus the vertical rise of the mass for a small horizontal (along-rod) displacement s is\nΔy ≈ 1/2 |y''(l/2)| s^2 = 1/2 κ_c s^2,\nwhere κ_c is positive in magnitude (we use its absolute value since the beam is concave downward at the midpoint).\n\nThe corresponding change in gravitational potential energy is\nΔU_g ≈ m g Δy = (1/2) m g κ_c s^2.\n\nHence, to linear order in s, the mass experiences an effective linear restoring force along the rod direction with stiffness\nk_eff = m g κ_c = m g (m g l)/(4 E I) = (m^2 g^2 l)/(4 E I).\n\nStep 3: Small-oscillation frequency\nThe small-oscillation equation for the mass along the rod’s direction is\nm s¨ + k_eff s = 0,\nso the angular frequency is\nω = sqrt(k_eff/m) = sqrt(g κ_c) = sqrt(g (m g l)/(4 E I)).\n\nSubstituting I for a rectangular cross-section (thickness h in the bending direction, width a out of plane),\nI = a h^3 / 12,\nwe obtain\nω = g sqrt( m l /(4 E I) ) = g sqrt( m l /(4 E (a h^3/12)) ) = g sqrt( 3 m l /(E a h^3) ).\n\nDimensional check\n- [I] = m^4, [E] = N/m^2, so [E I] = N·m^2 = kg·m^3/s^2.\n- Inside the square root: (m l)/(E a h^3) has units (kg·m)/(kg·m^3/s^2) = s^2/m^2. Multiply by g^2 (m^2/s^4) gives 1/s^2, so ω has units 1/s.\n\nRemarks and assumptions\n- The result exploits that the restoring force for small motion along the beam comes from the increase in gravitational potential as the mass moves up the locally quadratic “valley” set by the beam’s bent shape under P = m g. Frictionless contact ensures no tangential elastic force opposes motion directly; the elastic properties (E, I) enter through the curvature κ_c created by the static load m g.\n- The small-angle assumption ensures that s can be identified (to leading order) with the horizontal displacement near the beam’s midpoint.\n- If the beam length were appreciably greater than l (pre-buckled arch without load), there would be an additional curvature even at P = 0 and the same argument would give ω = sqrt(g κ_center), with κ_center now determined by the pre-buckling geometry and any superposed load. Here, under the stated assumptions and neglecting the beam’s own weight, the curvature (and thus ω) is set by m g and the bending stiffness EI.\n\nFinal formula\nUsing I = a h^3 / 12, the small-amplitude angular frequency for a horizontal perturbation of the mass along the beam at midspan is\nω = g sqrt( 3 m l / (E a h^3) ).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{ \\omega \\;=\\; g\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{3\\,m\\,l}{E\\,a\\,h^{3}}}\\, }\\]"}

Hence\n  n_s(r) = A_s exp[+m_s ω^2 r^2/(2 k_B T0)].\n\n- Define k ≡ ω^2/(2 k_B T0) as given. Then for positive ions (mass m_i = m_tot) and electrons (mass m_e), the profiles are\n  n_i(r) = A_i e^{β_i r^2}, with β_i = m_tot k,\n  n_e(r) = A_e e^{β_e r^2}, with β_e = m_e k.\n\n- Assume (strong ionization; one electron per atom) total number of ions equals total number of electrons equals N within the cylinder of radius R and height H (H ≫ R), so\n  N = ∫_V n_s dV = 2π H ∫_0^R A_s e^{β_s r^2} r dr\n    = 2π H A_s [ (e^{β_s R^2} − 1)/(2 β_s) ]\n    = π H A_s (e^{β_s R^2} − 1)/β_s.\n\n  Therefore\n  A_s = N β_s / [π H (e^{β_s R^2} − 1)].\n\n- Hence\n  n_i(r) = N β_i e^{β_i r^2}/[π H (e^{β_i R^2} − 1)],\n  n_e(r) = N β_e e^{β_e r^2}/[π H (e^{β_e R^2} − 1)].\n\nStep 2: Space charge density and radial electric field\n\n- The volume charge density (taking ion charge +e, electron charge −e) is\n  ρ(r) = e [n_i(r) − n_e(r)]\n        = e N/(π H) [ β_i e^{β_i r^2}/(e^{β_i R^2} − 1) − β_e e^{β_e r^2}/(e^{β_e R^2} − 1) ].\n\n- For a long cylinder (H ≫ R), Gauss’ law gives the radial field E_r(r):\n  2π r H E_r(r) = (1/ε0) 2π H ∫_0^r ρ(r') r' dr' ⇒\n  E_r(r) = (1/(ε0 r)) ∫_0^r ρ(r') r' dr'.\n\n- A useful identity from the above is the radial derivative\n  dE_r/dr = ρ(r)/ε0 − E_r(r)/r.\n\nStep 3: UAV equilibrium and small oscillations in the co-rotating frame\n\n- Let the UAV have mass m, charge q0, and (during stable operation) sit at radius r0 at rest in the co-rotating frame. Horizontal thrust is unavailable, so radial force balance in the rotating frame is\n  q0 E_r(r0) + m ω^2 r0 = 0\n  (electric force inward balances outward centrifugal force).\n\n- Now perturb radially by a small displacement ξ(t) = r(t) − r0 with small velocities v_r = dξ/dt and small azimuthal velocity v_θ (both in the rotating frame). Linearizing the rotating-frame equations of motion gives the standard epicyclic pair:\n  m dv_r/dt − 2 m ω v_θ = [q0 E_r'(r0) + m ω^2] ξ,\n  m dv_θ/dt + 2 m ω v_r = 0,\n  with E_r'(r0) ≡ dE_r/dr|_{r0}. Eliminating v_θ yields a second-order ODE for v_r (hence for ξ):\n  d^2 v_r/dt^2 + [4 ω^2 − (q0/m)(E_r'(r0) + (m/m)(ω^2) − ω^2?)] v_r = 0\n  which simplifies, from the first equation as shown below, to\n  d^2 v_r/dt^2 + [3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E_r'(r0)] v_r = 0.\n\n  Since v_r = dξ/dt, ξ executes simple harmonic motion at the same angular frequency Ω given by\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E_r'(r0).\n\n- Use the identity for E_r'(r) and the equilibrium condition to eliminate E_r'(r0):\n  E_r'(r0) = ρ(r0)/ε0 − E_r(r0)/r0.\n  From equilibrium, (q0/m) E_r(r0)/r0 = −ω^2. Therefore\n  −(q0/m) E_r'(r0) = −(q0/m)(ρ(r0)/ε0) + (q0/m) E_r(r0)/r0\n                   = −(q0/(m ε0)) ρ(r0) − ω^2.\n\n  Plugging into Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E_r'(r0) gives the compact result\n  Ω^2 = 2 ω^2 − (q0/(m ε0)) ρ(r0).\n\n- With the explicit ρ(r0) from Step 2,\n  ρ(r0) = e N/(π H) [ β_i e^{β_i r0^2}/(e^{β_i R^2} − 1) − β_e e^{β_e r0^2}/(e^{β_e R^2} − 1) ],\n  β_i = m_tot k, β_e = m_e k, k = ω^2/(2 k_B T0).\n\nTherefore the precession (epicyclic) angular frequency is\n\nΩ = sqrt{ 2 ω^2 − (q0/(m ε0)) ρ(r0) }\n   = sqrt{ 2 ω^2 − (q0 e N)/(m ε0 π H) [ β_i e^{β_i r0^2}/(e^{β_i R^2} − 1) − β_e e^{β_e r0^2}/(e^{β_e R^2} − 1) ] }.\n\nRemarks and limits\n\n- The result depends only on the local space charge density ρ(r0) (and not on the full E_r profile), thanks to the equilibrium condition and Gauss’ law identity. This is the cleanest way to express Ω “in terms of q0 and r0” together with known system parameters.\n- Stability (periodic precession) requires Ω^2 > 0, i.e.\n  2 ω^2 > (q0/(m ε0)) ρ(r0).\n  For a positively charged UAV (q0 > 0) placed at a radius where ρ(r0) < 0 (electron-dominated interior), the correction increases Ω above sqrt(2) ω; conversely, if ρ(r0) > 0 it reduces Ω.\n- In the special case where the radial electric field is exactly linear E_r = −(m ω^2/q0) r (so that the centrifugal balance holds at all radii), one finds ρ/ε0 = E_r' + E_r/r = −2 m ω^2/q0, and the formula gives Ω = 2 ω, as expected for inertial oscillations in a uniformly rotating frame.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\Omega \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\,2\\,\\omega^{2}\\;-\\;\\frac{q_{0}}{m\\,\\varepsilon_{0}}\\,\\rho(r_{0})\\,}\n\\;=\\;\n\\sqrt{\\,2\\,\\omega^{2}\\;-\\;\\frac{q_{0}\\,e\\,N}{m\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\pi H}\n\\left[\n\\frac{\\beta_{i}\\,e^{\\beta_{i} r_{0}^{2}}}{e^{\\beta_{i} R^{2}}-1}\n-\n\\frac{\\beta_{e}\\,e^{\\beta_{e} r_{0}^{2}}}{e^{\\beta_{e} R^{2}}-1}\n\\right]\\,}\n\\quad,\\;\\;\\beta_{i}=m_{\\mathrm{tot}}\\,k,\\;\\beta_{e}=m_{e}\\,k,\\;k=\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{2k_{B}T_{0}}.\n}\n\\]"}
