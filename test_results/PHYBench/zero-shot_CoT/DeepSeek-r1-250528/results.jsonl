For harmonic motion, the time-average of the square of acceleration is:  \n   \\[\n   \\overline{a^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\omega^4 |X|^2\n   \\]  \n   The radiated power for a charged particle is given as:  \n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{e^2 \\overline{\\dot{v}^2}}{6\\pi \\varepsilon_0 c^3} = \\frac{e^2 \\overline{a^2}}{6\\pi \\varepsilon_0 c^3}\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\(\\overline{a^2}\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\overline{P_{\\text{rad}}} = \\frac{e^2}{6\\pi \\varepsilon_0 c^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\omega^4 |X|^2 = \\frac{e^4 \\omega^4 E_0^2}{12\\pi \\varepsilon_0 c^3 m^2 \\left[ (\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2 \\omega^2 \\right]}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Incident Intensity in the Medium**:  \n   The average intensity of a monochromatic plane wave in a medium with refractive index \\(n\\) is:  \n   \\[\n   I = \\frac{1}{2} n \\varepsilon_0 c E_0^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Absorption Coefficient**:  \n   The absorption coefficient \\(\\alpha\\) relates to the decrease in intensity per unit distance. The energy removed from the beam per unit volume per unit time is \\(N \\overline{P_{\\text{rad}}}\\), where \\(N\\) is the number density of electrons. Thus:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{dI}{dz} = -N \\overline{P_{\\text{rad}}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\alpha I = N \\overline{P_{\\text{rad}}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\alpha = \\frac{N \\overline{P_{\\text{rad}}}}{I}\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the expressions for \\(\\overline{P_{\\text{rad}}}\\) and \\(I\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\alpha = \\frac{N \\cdot \\frac{e^4 \\omega^4 E_0^2}{12\\pi \\varepsilon_0 c^3 m^2 \\left[ (\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2 \\omega^2 \\right]}}{\\frac{1}{2} n \\varepsilon_0 c E_0^2} = \\frac{N e^4 \\omega^4}{6\\pi \\varepsilon_0^2 c^4 n m^2 \\left[ (\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2 \\omega^2 \\right]}\n   \\]\n\nThe expression for \\(\\alpha\\) is consistent with the classical model, where the radiated power accounts for the energy scattered out of the incident beam, leading to attenuation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\alpha = \\dfrac{N e^{4} \\omega^{4}}{6\\pi \\varepsilon_{0}^{2} c^{4} n m^{2} \\left[ (\\omega_{0}^{2} - \\omega^{2})^{2} + \\gamma^{2} \\omega^{2} \\right]}}\n\\]"}

Next, we utilize the following property: the infinitesimal displacement caused by an increase in $\\mu$ between equipotential surfaces is the derivative of the coordinates with respect to $\\mu$:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x=a\\mathrm{sh}\\mu\\cos\\nu\\mathrm{d}\\mu\\quad,\\quad\\mathrm{d}z=a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\\sin\\nu\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\n\nWe proceed to calculate the length of this displacement:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}s={\\sqrt{\\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\\mathrm{d}z^{2}}}=a{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{ch}^{2}\\mu-\\cos^{2}\\nu}}\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the electric potential difference caused by displacements between one ellipse and another. This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2). We obtain the following equation:\n\n$$\n{\\frac{E_{0}a^{2}}{a^{2}+a^{2}\\mathrm{{sh}}^{2}\\mu\\sin^{2}{90^{\\circ}}}}\\cdot a\\mathrm{{ch}}\\mu\\mathrm{{d}}\\mu=E\\cdot a{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{{ch}}^{2}\\mu-\\cos^{2}\\nu}}\\mathrm{{d}}\\mu\n$$\n\nThis gives the distribution of electric field strength. To determine the direction of electric field lines, we only need to locate the bisector of the angle formed by lines connecting the two foci:\n\n$$\n\\theta={\\frac{\\theta_{+}+\\theta_{-}}{2}}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\tan\\theta_{\\pm}={\\frac{z}{x\\pm a}}\n$$\n\nWe organize the result:\n\n$$\nf(x,z)={\\frac{2a^{2}}{\\left[{\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}}+{\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right]^{2}}}\\left[\\left[{\\frac{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{4}}+\\left[{\\frac{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\right]~.\n$$\n\nWith $z=0$, $x=r$, we obtain:\n\n$$\nf(r)=\\frac{2a^{2}}{(r+a+|r-a|)\\sqrt{|r^{2}-a^{2}|}}\n$$\n\nFor the electric field, a charged circular disk with radius $a$ is required to generate it.

We can choose the $\\pmb{x}$ axis along the direction of $\\pmb{E}$, so $\\pmb{E}_{y}=0$, and the velocity components related to transverse components can be treated separately. The equation of motion is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d v}{d t}}=q({\\pmb{E}}+v\\times{\\pmb{B}})\n$$  \n\nIts $\\pmb{z}$ component is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{z}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{z}\n$$  \n\nIntegrating yields  \n\n$$\nv_{\\tau}=\\frac{q E_{z}}{m}t+v_{z0}\n$$  \n\nThis is a simple motion along the direction of $\\pmb{B}$.

Thus, the two equations can be replaced by  \n\n$$\nv_{x}=v_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{\\mathrm{e}}t+\\delta)}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\upsilon_{y}=-i\\upsilon_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the angle between the component of the particle's initial velocity in the $_{xy}$ plane ${\\pmb v}_{\\bot}$ and the $\\pmb{x}$ axis (counter-clockwise direction).

Since we already know that the term $\\textstyle m{\\frac{d v}{d t}}$ only gives rise to circular motion with frequency $\\omega_{c}$, this term can be ignored in equation (1). Thus, equation (1) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{{ E}}+\\pmb{{\\upsilon}}\\times\\pmb{{ B}}=0\n$$  \n\nBy taking the cross product of $\\pmb{B}$ with the above expression, we get  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{E}\\times\\pmb{B}=\\pmb{B}\\times(\\pmb{v}\\times\\pmb{B})=\\pmb{v}\\pmb{B}^{2}-\\pmb{B}(\\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{B})\n$$  \n\nThe transverse component of this equation is  \n\n$$\nv_{\\perp q c}=E\\times B/B^{2}\\equiv v_{E}\n$$  \n\nWe define this transverse component as $\\pmb{v}_{E}$, which is the electric field drift towards the center of guidance.\n\nThe equation of motion for the particle is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d{\\boldsymbol{v}}}{d t}}=q[{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{y}})+{\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times{\\boldsymbol{B}}]\n$$  \n\nDecomposing into scalar form, we have  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{x}=\\frac{q B}{m}v_{y}+\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}(y)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{y}=-\\frac{q B}{m}v_{x}\n$$  \n\nSimplifying yields  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{\\upsilon}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\upsilon_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\frac{\\dot{E}_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\pmb{E_{x}}(\\pmb{y})$ is the electric field at the particle's location. To compute this value, we need to know the particle's trajectory, which is precisely what we attempt to solve initially. If the electric field is weak, as a first approximation, we can estimate $E_{x}(y)$ using the undisturbed trajectory.\n\nThe trajectory in the absence of an electric field is given by  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{r_{L}=\\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{|q|B}}\\end{array}$ is the Larmor gyration radius, and we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)\n$$  \n\nWe seek a solution that is the sum of the gyration at $\\omega_{c}$ and a stationary drift $_{v_{E}}$. Since we are interested in expressing $v_{E}$, we can average over one cycle to eliminate the gyration motion. Thus, the equation yields  \n\n$$\n\\bar{v}_{x}=0\n$$  \n\nIn the above equation, the average of the oscillating term $\\ddot{v}_{y}$ is clearly zero, giving us  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\ddot{v}}}_{y}=0=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\overline{{v}}_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\overline{{\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)}}\n$$  \n\nUpon expanding the small approximation and averaging, we find  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{v}}_{y}=-\\frac{E_{x}(y_{0})}{B}(1-\\frac{1}{4}k^{2}r_{L}^{2})\n$$  \n\nThus, due to non-uniformity, the usual $\\pmb{{E}}\\times\\pmb{{B}}$ drift is modified to  \n\n$$\n\\boxed{v_{E}={\\frac{E\\times B}{B^{2}}}(1-{\\frac{1}{4}}{(k \\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{\\vert{q}\\vert B})}^2)}\n$$  \n\nThe correction term represents the finite Larmor radius effect under the sinusoidal electric field distribution.", "final_answers": "$$\nv_E = \\frac{E \\times B}{B^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left(k \\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q| B}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$", "improved_solutions": "\nTo find the guiding center drift velocity for a particle with charge \\(q\\) and mass \\(m\\) in the given electric and magnetic fields, consider the electric field \\(\\pmb{E} = E_0 \\cos(k y) \\hat{\\pmb{x}}\\) and uniform magnetic field \\(\\pmb{B} = B \\hat{\\pmb{z}}\\).

{"id": "MECHANICS/716", "questions": "The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q. A lightweight, smooth-walled insulating thin tube can rotate around a vertical axis through point O in the horizontal plane. At a distance L from point O inside the tube, there is a photoelectric trigger control switch A. A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined. If the distance OB is measured to be $L/2$, determine the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube when the ball is at point B.

This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical.

The solenoid extends from the origin along the negative $z$-axis to infinity, and the current is viewed as rotating counterclockwise when observed from above the $z$-axis, meaning the direction of the current is in the positive $\\hat{\\theta}$ direction. Now, a superconducting metal ring is placed such that some constraint keeps the symmetry axis of the current loop always coinciding with the $z$-axis, allowing it to move freely up and down in this state. It is known that at the instant the metal ring transitions from normal to superconducting state, a current $I_{0}$ flows within the ring, and there is no other external magnetic field at a sufficiently far distance from the solenoid. $I_{0}$ flows in the positive $\\hat{\\theta}$ direction. Subsequently, the metal ring remains in the superconducting state.

In the reference frame of the spaceship, the frequency of the photons emitted backward is $ u _{0}$. For simplicity, we assume that the \\\"windward side\\\" of the Trisolarian spaceship is a flat surface with an area $S$. During flight, dust floating in the universe may collide with it. We assume that the cosmic dust is composed of particles with rest mass $m$. For an observer on Earth: the spaceship moves at a constant speed of $v _1$, the particles in the cosmic dust have a speed of $v_2$ and move in the same direction as the spaceship, and the particles in the dust are uniformly distributed with a density of $n$. If, according to the Trisolarian beings on the spaceship, the cosmic dust undergoes a \\\"perfectly elastic collision\\\" upon impact with the spaceship, what is the number $N^{'}$ of photons that need to be emitted backward per unit time in the reference frame of the spaceship to maintain its constant speed? Given are Planck's constant $h$, the speed of light in vacuum $c$, and relativistic effects need to be considered.\n", "solutions": "There are two reference frames; let's set up the agreements first. The reference frame of the Earth observer is called the $\\Sigma$ frame, and the reference frame of the spaceship is called the $\\Sigma$ frame.  We agree that: $$\\beta_{1}=\\frac{v_{1}}{c},\\gamma_{1}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{1}^{2}}},\\beta_{2}=\\frac{v_{2}}{c},\\gamma_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{2}^{2}}},\\beta_{21}=\\frac{v_{21}}{c},\\gamma_{21}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{21}^{2}}}$$ $$\\beta_{2}^{'}=\\frac{v_{2}^{'}}{c},\\gamma_{2}^{'}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{2}^{'2}}},\\beta_{21}^{'}=\\frac{v_{21}^{'}}{c},\\gamma_{21}^{'}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{21}^{'2}}}$$    The resistance of the spaceship is equal to the impulse given to the spaceship by cosmic dust particles per unit time. In the reference frame of the spaceship, we have:    $$ F^{'}=n^{'}S\\left|v_{2}^{'}\\right|\\times\\left|p_{2}^{'}-p_{21}^{'}\\right|=n^{'}S\\left|v_{2}^{'}\\right|\\times\\left|2p_{2}^{'}\\right|=2n^{'}S m \\gamma_{2}^{'}v_{2}^{'2} $$    The calculation of $n'$ needs to take into account the length contraction effect. If the particle density is $n_{0}$ in the rest frame of the cosmic dust itself, we have:  $$ n=n_{0}\\gamma_{2}, n^{'}=n_{0}\\gamma_{2}^{'} $$  Therefore, we can obtain $n^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\gamma_{2}^{'}}{\\gamma_{2}}n_{0}$.    Since $S$ is perpendicular to the direction of velocity, it is identical in both reference frames.  By relativistic velocity transformation:  $$ v_{2}^{'}=\\frac{v_{2}-v_{1}}{1-\\frac{v_{2}v_{1}}{c^{2}}} $$    Substituting into the expression for $F$ yields:  $$ F^{'}=2\\frac{\\gamma_{2}^{'}}{\\gamma_{2}}n S m\\gamma_{2}^{'} v_{2}^{'2}=2n S m\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\gamma_{2}(v_{1}-v_{2})^{2} $$    From momentum conservation in the spaceship reference frame, we can obtain:  $$ \\boldsymbol{F}^{'}=\\frac{N^{'} h  u_{0}}{c} $$    $$ N^{'}=\\frac{2n S m c\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\gamma_{2}(v_{1}-v_{2})^{2}}{h  u_{0}} $$\n", "final_answers": "$$\n\\frac{2nSmc(v_{1}-v_{2})^{2}}{(1-\\left(\\frac{v_1}{c}\\right)^2)\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{v_2}{c}\\right)^2}h\\nu_{0}}\n$$", "improved_solutions": "\nTo determine the number of photons \\(N'\\) emitted per unit time in the spaceship's reference frame to maintain its constant speed, the thrust from photon emission must balance the force due to cosmic dust collisions with the windward side (front surface) of the spaceship. The analysis is conducted in the spaceship's rest frame, considering relativistic effects.\n\n### Step 1: Photon Thrust Force\nIn the spaceship frame, photons are emitted directly backward with frequency \\(\\nu_0\\). The energy of each photon is \\(h \\nu_0\\), and the magnitude of its momentum is \\(h \\nu_0 / c\\). When emitted backward, the photon's momentum vector is \\(-(h \\nu_0 / c) \\hat{x}\\) (where \\(\\hat{x}\\) is the direction of motion). By conservation of momentum, the spaceship gains momentum \\((h \\nu_0 / c) \\hat{x}\\) per photon emitted. Thus, the thrust force \\(F_{\\text{photon}}\\) from emitting \\(N'\\) photons per unit time is:\n\\[\nF_{\\text{photon}} = N' \\frac{h \\nu_0}{c} \\quad \\text{(in the forward direction)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Dust Collision Force\nThe force due to dust collisions is derived from the rate of momentum transfer to the spaceship in its rest frame.\n\n#### Relative Speed and Density in Spaceship Frame\nIn the Earth frame, the spaceship moves at velocity \\(v_1\\), and dust particles move at velocity \\(v_2\\) in the same direction, with number density \\(n\\). Assuming \\(v_1 > v_2\\) (so dust hits the front surface), the relative speed \\(w\\) between the spaceship and dust in the spaceship frame is:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - v_1 v_2 / c^2}.\n\\]\nThe Lorentz factors are:\n\\[\n\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_1^2 / c^2}}, \\quad \\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_2^2 / c^2}}.\n\\]\nThe number density of dust in the spaceship frame \\(n'\\) is:\n\\[\nn' = n \\gamma_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}\\right).\n\\]\n\n#### Rate of Dust Particle Impacts\nThe windward side is a flat surface of area \\(S\\), perpendicular to the direction of motion. The flux of dust particles (number per unit time per unit area) hitting the surface is \\(n' w\\), since particles approach with speed \\(w\\) toward the front. The total rate \\(R'\\) of particles hitting per unit time is:\n\\[\nR' = n' w S = \\left[ n \\gamma_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}\\right) \\right] \\left[ \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - v_1 v_2 / c^2} \\right] S = n \\gamma_1 (v_1 - v_2) S.\n\\]\n\n#### Impulse per Collision\nEach dust particle has rest mass \\(m\\). In the spaceship frame, before collision, a dust particle approaches with velocity \\(-w \\hat{x}\\) and momentum \\(\\vec{p}_{d,i} = -\\gamma_w m w \\hat{x}\\), where \\(\\gamma_w = \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 (1 - v_1 v_2 / c^2)\\). Assuming the spaceship is much more massive than a dust particle (\\(M \\gg m\\)), the collision is perfectly elastic, and the dust particle reverses direction with the same speed \\(w\\). Thus, after collision, its momentum is \\(\\vec{p}_{d,f} = \\gamma_w m w \\hat{x}\\). The change in momentum of the dust particle is:\n\\[\n\\Delta \\vec{p}_d = \\vec{p}_{d,f} - \\vec{p}_{d,i} = \\gamma_w m w \\hat{x} - (-\\gamma_w m w \\hat{x}) = 2 \\gamma_w m w \\hat{x}.\n\\]\nBy conservation of momentum and Newton's third law, the impulse imparted to the spaceship per collision is:\n\\[\n\\Delta \\vec{p}_{\\text{ship}} = -\\Delta \\vec{p}_d = -2 \\gamma_w m w \\hat{x}.\n\\]\nThe magnitude of the impulse is \\(2 \\gamma_w m w\\), directed opposite to motion (backward). Using \\(\\gamma_w w = \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2)\\), the impulse magnitude is:\n\\[\n|\\Delta \\vec{p}_{\\text{ship}}| = 2 \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2) m.\n\\]\n\n#### Average Force from Dust Collisions\nThe average force \\(F_{\\text{dust}}\\) (magnitude) is the impulse per collision times the collision rate:\n\\[\nF_{\\text{dust}} = |\\Delta \\vec{p}_{\\text{ship}}| R' = [2 \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2) m] [n \\gamma_1 (v_1 - v_2) S] = 2 m n \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2)^2 S.\n\\]\nThis force is directed backward.\n\n### Step 3: Force Balance\nTo maintain constant speed, the net force on the spaceship must be zero. Thus, the photon thrust force (forward) must equal the dust collision force (backward) in magnitude:\n\\[\nF_{\\text{photon}} = F_{\\text{dust}}.\n\\]\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\\[\nN' \\frac{h \\nu_0}{c} = 2 m n \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2)^2 S.\n\\]\nSolving for \\(N'\\):\n\\[\nN' = \\frac{2 m n \\gamma_1^2 \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2)^2 S c}{h \\nu_0}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of photons emitted per unit time in the spaceship frame is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{N' = \\dfrac{2 m n \\gamma_1^{2} \\gamma_2 (v_1 - v_2)^{2} S c}{h \\nu_0}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma_1 = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_1^2 / c^2}}\\) and \\(\\gamma_2 = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_2^2 / c^2}}\\). This result assumes \\(v_1 > v_2\\) so that dust particles collide with the front surface."}

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession.
