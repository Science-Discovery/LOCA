{"id": "OPTICS/495", "questions": "In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate. This was the first time humanity recognized the relationship between electromagnetic phenomena and light phenomena. The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

A uniform static magnetic field B0 is applied along the direction of propagation (take z-axis). The incident light is monochromatic with angular frequency ω and propagates along +z.\n\n1) Electron equation of motion and circular basis\n- For an electron (charge −e, mass m) displaced by r(t) in the xy-plane, the Lorentz equation (neglecting damping to enforce no absorption) is:\n  m d^2r/dt^2 + m ω0^2 r = −e [E e^(−iωt) + v × B0]\n  with v = dr/dt and B0 = B0 ẑ.\n\n- For harmonic time dependence e^(−iωt), v = −i ω r. The magnetic term is:\n  v × B0 = (−i ω r) × (B0 ẑ) = −i ω B0 J r, where J = [[0, 1], [−1, 0]] rotates a vector by +90°.\n\n- The equation becomes (in the transverse xy-plane):\n  [ m(ω0^2 − ω^2) I − e i ω B0 J ] r = − e E\n\n- The operator J has eigenvectors corresponding to left/right circular polarizations e± = (x̂ ± i ŷ)/√2 with eigenvalues ±i. Therefore, in the circular basis (E± along e±, r± along e±), the equations decouple:\n  [ m(ω0^2 − ω^2) ± e ω B0 ] r± = − e E±\n\n2) Polarization and susceptibilities\n- The induced dipole for one electron is p = −e r. For an atom with Z identical outer electrons and a number density N atoms per unit volume, the macroscopic polarization for the ± circular component is:\n  P± = N Z (−e) r± = N Z e^2 E± / [ m(ω0^2 − ω^2) ± e ω B0 ]\n\n- Defining the electric susceptibility by P± = ε0 χ± E±, one gets:\n  χ±(ω, B0) = N Z e^2 / [ ε0 ( m(ω0^2 − ω^2) ± e ω B0 ) ]\n\n- For zero field (B0 = 0):\n  χ0(ω) = N Z e^2 / [ ε0 m(ω0^2 − ω^2) ], and the (ordinary) refractive index n(ω) satisfies n^2(ω) = 1 + χ0(ω), real since we assumed no absorption.\n\n3) Birefringence for circular polarizations to first order in B0\n- For weak fields, expand χ± to first order in B0. Let D = m(ω0^2 − ω^2):\n  χ± = N Z e^2 / [ε0 (D ± e ω B0)] ≈ χ0 ∓ N Z e^3 ω B0 / (ε0 D^2)\n\n- Therefore,\n  n_±^2 = 1 + χ± ≈ n^2 ∓ N Z e^3 ω B0 / (ε0 D^2)\n\n- Since n_± = n + (1/2n)(n_±^2 − n^2) to first order, one finds:\n  n_+ − n_- ≈ (1/2n)[(n_+^2 − n^2) − (n_-^2 − n^2)] = − 1/n [ N Z e^3 ω B0 / (ε0 D^2) ]\n\n- It is convenient to express this in terms of the dispersion dn/dω. Differentiate n^2(ω) = 1 + χ0(ω):\n  d(n^2)/dω = − (2 m ω N Z e^2) / (ε0 D^2)\n\n  Hence,\n  dn/dω = (1/2n) d(n^2)/dω = − (m ω N Z e^2) / (ε0 n D^2)\n\n  Using this, the difference becomes\n  n_+ − n_- = (e B0 / m) dn/dω\n\n  The sign depends on the convention for which circular polarization is labeled “+”; the magnitude is what matters for the rotation.\n\n4) Rotation and Verdet constant\n- For propagation over length d, the two circular modes accumulate phases k_± d with k_± = n_± ω / c. A linearly polarized wave (superposition of equal ± circulars) will rotate by\n  β = (1/2) (k_+ − k_-) d = (ω / 2c) (n_+ − n_-) d\n\n- Comparing with β = v B0 d (Faraday’s law of rotation), the Verdet constant is\n  v(ω) = (ω / 2c) ∂(n_+ − n_-)/∂B0 |_(B0→0) = (ω / 2c) (e / m) dn/dω\n\n- In terms of wavelength λ (using ω = 2π c / λ), this is often written as:\n  v(λ) = − (e λ / 2 m c) dn/dλ\n\n- If one prefers an explicit expression in terms of the Lorentz parameters (N, Z, ω0) and n(ω), substitute dn/dω above:\n  v(ω) = − [ N Z e^3 ω^2 ] / [ 2 ε0 c n(ω) [ m(ω0^2 − ω^2) ]^2 ]\n\n  The overall sign depends on the handedness convention; the magnitude follows from the formulae above.\n\nSummary of key results:\n- Circular indices split linearly with B: n_+ − n_- = (e B / m) dn/dω\n- Faraday rotation per unit length: β/d = (ω / 2c) (n_+ − n_-)\n- Verdet constant: v(ω) = (e ω / 2 m c) dn/dω = − (e λ / 2 m c) dn/dλ\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,v(\\omega)\\;=\\;\\frac{e\\,\\omega}{2 m c}\\,\\frac{dn}{d\\omega}\\;=\\;-\\;\\frac{e\\,\\lambda}{2 m c}\\,\\frac{dn}{d\\lambda}\\,}\n\\]"}

A vertical upward impulse is applied at the rightmost (overhanging) rim point, imparting both an upward velocity to the center of mass and a pitch angular velocity about a horizontal diameter.\n\nKey observation and simplifying model\n- Immediately after the impulse, the only way to maintain contact with an impenetrable, frictionless plane while the disk pitches is for the disk to have an instantaneous center of rotation at some point of the footprint that has zero vertical velocity. To minimize the center-of-mass speed required to eventually lose contact, the most favorable (least demanding) configuration is that the instantaneous contact reduces to the far-left rim point A (the lowest and most “leveraged” point relative to the right-side lift), and the disk executes pure rotation about A while in contact.\n- In that case, at t=0+, the vertical velocity of point A is zero, which enforces the kinematic relation between the center-of-mass vertical speed v0 and the initial angular speed Ω about the (horizontal) y-axis:\n  v0 = r Ω.\n\nEquations of motion while in contact (rotation about A)\n- Let φ(t) be the rotation angle about A (about the y-axis), with φ = 0 at the initial horizontal configuration and φ > 0 meaning the right edge rises. While the disk remains in contact at A, the motion is pure rotation about A, so the height of the center of mass is\n  z_c(φ) = r sin φ,\n  and its vertical speed is\n  ż_c = r cos φ φ̇,\n  with initial condition ż_c(0) = v0 = r φ̇(0).\n\n- The moment of inertia about the contact point A (axis parallel to y through A) is\n  I_A = I_cm(y) + m r^2 = (1/4) m r^2 + m r^2 = (5/4) m r^2.\n\n- The gravitational torque about A is τ_y = m g r cos φ, so the rotational equation of motion is\n  I_A φ̈ = m g r cos φ.          (1)\n\n- Energy conservation (normal reaction at A does no work) gives\n  1/2 I_A φ̇^2 + m g r sin φ = 1/2 I_A (v0^2 / r^2).      (2)\n\nContact (normal force) and lift-off condition\n- The vertical acceleration of the center is\n  z̈_c = r cos φ φ̇^2 + r sin φ φ̈.\n  Using (1), φ̈ = (m g r / I_A) cos φ, hence\n  z̈_c = r cos φ φ̇^2 + (m g r^2 / I_A) sin φ cos φ.\n\n- Vertical force balance on the disk gives N − m g = m z̈_c, where N is the normal reaction at A. Therefore\n  N = m g + m r cos φ φ̇^2 + (m^2 g r^2 / I_A) sin φ cos φ.      (3)\n\n- Lift-off occurs when N = 0. Setting N = 0 in (3) gives\n  r cos φ φ̇^2 = − g [1 + (m r^2 / I_A) sin φ cos φ].\n  With I_A = (5/4) m r^2, we have (m r^2 / I_A) = 4/5, so\n  φ̇^2 = − (g / (r cos φ)) [1 + (4/5) sin φ cos φ].            (4)\n  This requires cos φ < 0 (i.e., φ ∈ (π/2, π)) so that φ̇^2 ≥ 0 at lift-off.\n\nRelating v0 to the lift-off angle\n- Substitute (4) into the energy equation (2) evaluated at the lift-off angle φ:\n  1/2 I_A φ̇^2 + m g r sin φ = 1/2 I_A (v0^2 / r^2)\n  ⇒ v0^2 = (r^2 / I_A) [I_A φ̇^2 + 2 m g r sin φ].\n\n  Using (4),\n  I_A φ̇^2 = − I_A (g/(r cos φ)) [1 + (4/5) sin φ cos φ]\n           = − (g r / cos φ) − (4/5) g r sin φ.\n\n  Therefore,\n  v0^2 = (r^2 / I_A) [ − (g r / cos φ) − (4/5) g r sin φ + 2 m g r sin φ ].\n\n  With I_A = (5/4) m r^2, (r^2 / I_A)·2 m g r = (8/5) g r, and (r^2 / I_A)·(4/5) g r = (4/5)(r^2 / I_A) g r = (4/5)·(4/(5 m r^2))? It is simpler to use the result already collected above:\n  v0^2 = g r [ (4/5) sin φ − sec φ ].                        (5)\n\nMinimization over the lift-off angle\n- The lift-off must occur with φ ∈ (π/2, π). Define\n  f(φ) = (4/5) sin φ − sec φ.\n  Then v0^2 = g r f(φ).\n\n- Differentiate on (π/2, π):\n  f′(φ) = (4/5) cos φ − sec φ tan φ.\n  In (π/2, π), cos φ < 0, tan φ < 0, sec φ < 0, hence sec φ tan φ > 0, and (4/5) cos φ < 0, so f′(φ) < 0 throughout. Thus f is strictly decreasing on (π/2, π).\n\n- Therefore, the minimum of v0^2 occurs in the limit φ → π−:\n  sin φ → 0, sec φ → −1 ⇒ f(φ) → 0 − (−1) = 1.\n\nConsequently,\nv0,min^2 = g r,\nso\nv0,min = sqrt(g r).\n\nInterpretation\n- The minimal initial center-of-mass speed that guarantees the coin eventually loses contact with the table is independent of the impulse details and depends only on g and r. In the minimizing trajectory, the disk effectively pivots about the far-left rim point while in contact, and lift-off occurs asymptotically as the disk approaches a half-turn (φ → π).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{v_{0,\\min} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{g\\,r}}\\]"}

We neglect the small O(Ω^2) centrifugal correction to the restoring force, which is standard in the Foucault-pendulum approximation.\n\n- Let x(t), y(t) be the bob’s horizontal displacements relative to the carriage pivot. For small angles, the linearized equations of a pendulum in the Earth-rotating frame (carriage frame translating with acceleration a_c(t) along x) are\n  x'' + ω0^2 x - 2 Ω y' = - a_c(t)\n  y'' + ω0^2 y + 2 Ω x' = 0\n  where ω0^2 = g/l is the small-angle pendulum frequency squared.\n\n2) Carriage acceleration including the bob’s back-reaction\n\n- Let X_c(t) be the carriage x-position in an inertial frame, and x(t) the bob’s relative displacement. The bob’s absolute x-position is X_b = X_c + x.\n\n- Along x, the only real external horizontal force on the system is F. Thus the center-of-mass acceleration gives\n  (M + m) X_cm'' = F\n  with X_cm = (M X_c + m (X_c + x)) / (M + m).

The eigenvalue condition is\n  det [ [ω0^2 - α ω^2, i 2 Ω ω], [- i 2 Ω ω, ω0^2 - ω^2] ] = 0,\n  which gives the biquadratic equation for ω^2:\n  α ω^4 - [(1 + α) ω0^2 + 4 Ω^2] ω^2 + ω0^4 = 0.\n\n- With α = 10/11 and ω0^2 = 10 Ω^2, this simplifies exactly to\n  ω_{1,2}^2 = [(127 ± √5129)/10] Ω^2,\n  i.e.\n  ω1 = Ω sqrt[(127 + √5129)/10],  ω2 = Ω sqrt[(127 - √5129)/10].\n\n- For each mode, the eigenvector relation gives\n  Y = i Q(ω) X with Q(ω) = 2 Ω ω / (ω0^2 - ω^2).\n  Consequently, for a real mode contribution ξ_k = C_k cos(ω_k t), one has η_k = C_k Q_k sin(ω_k t), where Q_k = Q(ω_k).\n\n6) Determine the coefficients from initial conditions\n\n- The general homogeneous solution is\n  ξ(t) = C1 cos(ω1 t) + C2 cos(ω2 t),\n  η(t) = C1 Q1 sin(ω1 t) + C2 Q2 sin(ω2 t).\n\n- Initial conditions η(0) = 0 and η'(0) = 0 imply\n  C1 Q1 ω1 + C2 Q2 ω2 = 0.\n  Using Q_k ω_k = 2 Ω ω_k^2 / (ω0^2 - ω_k^2), define S_k = ω_k^2 / (ω0^2 - ω_k^2). Then the condition is C1 S1 + C2 S2 = 0.\n\n- The condition ξ(0) = - x_p gives C1 + C2 = - x_p.\n\n- Solving, one finds\n  C1 = x_p S2 / (S1 - S2),  C2 = - x_p S1 / (S1 - S2).\n\n- For our parameters one can simplify S1 and S2 exactly using ω0^2 = 10 Ω^2 and ω_{1,2}^2 above. Let r = √5129.

{"id": "MECHANICS/101", "questions": "The problem discusses a stick figure model. The stick figure's head is a uniform sphere with a radius of $r$ and a mass of $m$, while the rest of the body consists of uniform rods with negligible thickness and a mass per unit length of $\\lambda$.

Specifically, the torso and both arms have a length of $l$, while the legs have a length of $1.2l$. $\\theta$ represents the angle between the arms and the torso, and $\\varphi$ represents the angle between the legs and the extended torso line (not an obtuse angle). The stick figure is composed of a head, a torso, two arms, and two legs. Initially, the stick figure is in a state where $\\theta=\\textstyle{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ and $\\varphi={\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$. The head has a mass of $m=0.6\\lambda l$, with the result expressed in terms of $\\lambda$. \n\nThe stick figure is a simulation of a real biological body, so if necessary, the connections between the torso and the arms/legs, in addition to providing interaction forces, can also exert a couple (i.e., a torque), even if there is no interaction force between them. This net torque is independent of the choice of reference point. In the following discussion, this will be referred to simply as a \"couple.\"\n\nDuring a certain free-fall motion, the stick figure, overwhelmed with panic, forgets to bring its legs together and swings its arms and torso with an amplitude of $\\theta_{0}$ (small angle) and an angular frequency of $\\omega$.

The arms are actively driven relative to the torso by a couple so that θ(t) = θ0 cos(ω t) with θ0 ≪ 1. The legs are passive (no active hip torque).\n- In free fall there is no gravitational restoring torque. To admit a leg resonance, we include a small passive torsional stiffness κ at the hip (representing passive tissues). This is consistent with the problem note that a joint can exert a couple. The resonance frequency then comes from this κ.\n- Let α(t) be the torso angle (about the hip), β(t) the absolute leg angle (about the hip), and φ(t) = α(t) − β(t) the leg–torso relative angle (the small oscillation of φ is “near π/4,” but since only small deviations enter the linearized dynamics, the offset does not affect the linear response).\n\nKinematics, inertias, and arm torque:\n- Two arms, each a uniform rod of length l about the shoulder. Moment of inertia of one arm about the shoulder: I_a,1 = (1/3) m_a l^2 = (1/3) λ l^3. Two arms: I_a = 2 I_a,1 = (2/3) λ l^3.\n- Legs: two identical uniform rods of length L = 1.2 l about the hip. One leg about the hip: I_ℓ,1 = (1/3) m_ℓ L^2 = (1/3) (1.2 λ l) (1.2 l)^2 = (1/3) × 1.728 λ l^3 = 0.576 λ l^3. Two legs: I_ℓ = 2 I_ℓ,1 = 1.152 λ l^3.\n- Torso: I_t (about hip) = (1/3) m_t l^2 = (1/3) λ l^3.\n- Head at distance l from hip, rigidly attached: I_h (about hip) = m l^2 + (2/5) m r^2 = (0.6 λ l) l^2 + (2/5)(0.6 λ l) r^2 = 0.6 λ l^3 + (6/25) λ l r^2.\n- Effective “upper” inertia about the hip if the arms co-rotate with the torso (through the shoulder) is the torso+head inertia plus the arms’ inertia about the shoulder, because the torque at the shoulder contains a term proportional to the torso angular acceleration α̈. Thus\n  I_u' = I_t + I_h + I_a\n       = (1/3 λ l^3) + (0.6 λ l^3 + (6/25) λ l r^2) + (2/3 λ l^3)\n       = [(1/3 + 0.6 + 2/3) λ l^3] + (6/25) λ l r^2\n       = [(14/15 + 10/15) λ l^3] + (6/25) λ l r^2\n       = (8/5) λ l^3 + (6/25) λ l r^2.\n\n- The reaction torque applied by the arms on the torso at the shoulders (sum of both arms) is, in free fall (no gravity), from angular momentum balance of the two arms about the shoulders:\n  τ_sh→torso(t) = −I_a (α̈ + θ̈).\n  Since θ(t) = θ0 cos(ω t), θ̈(t) = −ω^2 θ0 cos(ω t), so −I_a θ̈ = I_a ω^2 θ0 cos(ω t) is a sinusoidal drive on the torso. The −I_a α̈ part simply adds I_a to the upper inertia (already absorbed into I_u').\n\nEquations of motion (linearized, small angles):\n- Torso about the hip: I_u' α̈ + κ (α − β) = I_a ω^2 θ0 cos(ω t).\n- Legs about the hip: I_ℓ β̈ + κ (β − α) = 0.\n\nDefine the relative angle φ = α − β. Subtracting the leg equation from the torso equation and eliminating α̈, β̈ using the sum and difference gives a single forced oscillator for φ:\n- φ̈ + Ω0^2 φ = f(t), with\n  Ω0^2 = κ (1/I_u' + 1/I_ℓ),\n  f(t) = (I_a ω^2 θ0 / I_u') cos(ω t).\n\nThus the passive legs behave as a driven harmonic oscillator in φ with natural frequency Ω0 and forcing amplitude F0/I_u' where F0 = I_a ω^2 θ0.\n\nSteady-state amplitude and resonance:\n- For ω ≠ Ω0, the steady-state amplitude of φ is\n  |φ̂(ω)| = (I_a ω^2 θ0) / (I_u' |Ω0^2 − ω^2|).\n\n- At exact resonance, ω = Ω0, the undamped particular solution grows linearly in time (standard resonant forcing of an undamped oscillator):\n  φ_res(t) = (I_a ω^2 θ0)/(2 I_u' ω) t sin(ω t)\n           = (I_a/(2 I_u')) ω θ0 t sin(ω t).\n\nTherefore, the resonance amplitude envelope (peak-to-zero) grows as\n  A_res(t) = (I_a/(2 I_u')) ω θ0 t.\n\nInsert the inertias I_a and I_u' computed above:\n- I_a = (2/3) λ l^3,\n- I_u' = (8/5) λ l^3 + (6/25) λ l r^2 = λ [ (8/5) l^3 + (6/25) l r^2 ].\n\nThus\nA_res(t) = [ (2/3) λ l^3 ] / [ 2 λ ( (8/5) l^3 + (6/25) l r^2 ) ] ω θ0 t\n         = [ (1/3) l^3 ] / [ (8/5) l^3 + (6/25) l r^2 ] ω θ0 t\n         = [ (25/3) l^3 ] / [ 40 l^3 + 6 l r^2 ] ω θ0 t\n         = [ 25 l^2 / (120 l^2 + 18 r^2) ] ω θ0 t.\n\nFor completeness, the resonance frequency (in terms of the passive hip stiffness κ) is\nΩ0 = sqrt[ κ (1/I_u' + 1/I_ℓ) ],\nwith I_ℓ = 1.152 λ l^3 and I_u' as above. Note that the resonance amplitude growth coefficient A_res(t)/t is independent of κ (as is typical for undamped resonance).\n\nRemarks:\n- If small damping C exists at the hip, the steady-state resonant amplitude would saturate at A_res ≈ (I_a ω^2 θ0)/(C ω) = (I_a/(C)) ω θ0 (no linear growth with time).\n- If the head radius r ≪ l, the r-term is negligible, and the growth coefficient simplifies to approximately (25/120) ω θ0 t ≈ 0.2083 ω θ0 t.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{A_{\\mathrm{res}}(t)\\;=\\;\\frac{25\\,l^{2}}{120\\,l^{2}+18\\,r^{2}}\\;\\omega\\,\\theta_{0}\\;t\\,,\\quad\\text{with}\\;\\;\\omega=\\Omega_{0}=\\sqrt{\\kappa\\Big(\\frac{1}{I_u'}+\\frac{1}{I_\\ell}\\Big)}\\,,}\\]\nwhere I_u'=(8/5)\\,\\lambda\\,l^{3}+(6/25)\\,\\lambda\\,l\\,r^{2}, I_\\ell=1.152\\,\\lambda\\,l^{3}, and the arm inertia about the shoulders is I_a=(2/3)\\,\\lambda\\,l^{3}."}

In planar motion with constant speed v2, the acceleration magnitude is\na_h = v2 |dû/dt| = v2 |dθ/dt|,\nwhere θ is the angle of the line-of-sight vector r.\n\nTo compute dθ/dt, use the standard planar formula for the angular rate of a vector r(t):\ndθ/dt = (x ẏ − y ẋ)/|r|^2,\nwhere r = (x, y) and ṙ = (ẋ, ẏ) = v_f − v_h.\n\nAt the instant considered:\n- r = (x, y) = (0, −L),\n- ṙ = v_f − v_h = (v1, 0) − (0, −v2) = (v1, v2).\n\nThus,\ndθ/dt = (x ẏ − y ẋ)/|r|^2 = (0·v2 − (−L)·v1)/L^2 = v1/L.\n\nTherefore, the hound’s acceleration magnitude is\na_h = v2 (v1/L) = (v1 v2)/L.\n\nAlternative derivation (direct differentiation of v_h):\nSince v_h = v2 (r/|r|), differentiate:\na_h = dv_h/dt = v2 d/dt (r/|r|) = v2 [ (|r|^2 ṙ − r (r·ṙ))/|r|^3 ].\nWith r = (0, −L) and ṙ = (v1, v2), we have |r|^2 = L^2 and r·ṙ = −L v2. Then\n|r|^2 ṙ − r (r·ṙ) = L^2 (v1, v2) − (0, −L)(−L v2) = (L^2 v1, L^2 v2) − (0, L^2 v2) = (L^2 v1, 0).\nSo\na_h = v2 (L^2 v1, 0)/L^3 = (v1 v2/L, 0),\nwhose magnitude is v1 v2/L.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{\\displaystyle a = \\frac{v_{1} v_{2}}{L}}\\]"}

The strings are parallel and lie in the same vertical plane as the motion.\n- Their lower ends are attached symmetrically to a rigid, uniformly distributed semicircular arc (a semicircular wire) of radius R and total mass m, and a bead (point mass) of mass m slides without friction on the arc.\n- The potential energy reference is chosen so that the vertically stable configuration has total energy 0; the system executes small oscillations with total energy E0 > 0.\n\nGeometry in the stable (vertical) configuration:\n- The two string upper ends are at (±d/2, 0).\n- The two attachment points on the arc are the endpoints of the semicircle, separated by 2R. By symmetry, in the stable configuration those endpoints lie at (±R, −h) with h>0 determined by the string length:\n  L^2 = (d/2 − R)^2 + h^2,\n  so h = sqrt[L^2 − (d/2 − R)^2].\n- Each string makes a small angle φ with the vertical given by\n  tan φ = |(d/2 − R)| / h.\n\nCondition for one string to go slack at some instant:\n- Let the total mass be M = 2m. The only external forces are the two string tensions T1, T2 (each along its string) and the weights (sum W = −2mg j).\n- If, at some instant, one string (say the left one) has zero tension, then the single nonzero tension on the right must equal the net external force requirement:\n  T_right u_right = M a_COM − W,\n  where a_COM is the instantaneous acceleration of the system’s center of mass and u_right is the unit vector along the right string (from the lower end up toward the ceiling).\n- Therefore, a necessary instantaneous geometric condition is that the direction of M a_COM − W agrees with the string direction u_right. In components,\n  tan φ ≈ |(M a_COM,x)| / (M g + M a_COM,y).\n- For small oscillations, |a_COM,y| ≪ g, so to leading order\n  tan φ ≈ |a_COM,x| / g.\n\nThus, a necessary (and, with two degrees of freedom, achievable) condition for zero tension is\n  |a_COM,x| / g ≥ |(d/2 − R)| / h,\ni.e.,\n  |a_COM,x| ≥ g |(d/2 − R)| / sqrt[L^2 − (d/2 − R)^2].\n\nMaximizing the available horizontal COM acceleration for a given E0:\n- The system has two small-oscillation modes (approximately): a lower-frequency “rigid-body swing” of the suspended arc+bead and a higher-frequency “bead-on-arc” mode where the bead moves relative to the arc. For fixed total small-oscillation energy E0, the mode that maximizes |a_COM,x| is the high-frequency bead-on-arc mode (because a_max ∼ ω times the velocity amplitude for a given energy, and ω is larger).\n- In the limit where the arc’s rigid-body motion is much smaller than the bead motion in that mode, the center-of-mass horizontal position is dominated by the bead’s horizontal motion: for bead angular displacement θ (measured from the bottom of the semicircle), x_bead ≈ R sin θ ≈ R θ, while the arc’s COM remains nearly fixed in x. Hence the total COM horizontal position is\n  x_COM ≈ (m x_arc + m x_bead) / (2m) ≈ (R/2) θ,\nso\n  a_COM,x ≈ (R/2) θ̈.\n- For small oscillations of a bead on a circular arc under gravity (about the bottom), θ̈ + (g/R) θ = 0, so θ(t) = Θ cos(√(g/R) t + δ) with amplitude Θ. Then the horizontal COM acceleration amplitude is\n  |a_COM,x|max = (R/2) (g/R) Θ = (g/2) Θ.\n- The (small-oscillation) energy residing in the bead mode is\n  E_bead = (1/2) m (R θ̇)^2 + (1/2) m g R θ^2,\nso at turning points θ̇ = 0, E_bead = (1/2) m g R Θ^2 ⇒ Θ = sqrt[2 E_bead / (m g R)].\nThus\n  |a_COM,x|max = (g/2) sqrt[2 E_bead / (m g R)] = sqrt[g E_bead / (2 m R)].\n- To maximize |a_COM,x| with total energy E0 available, put all small-oscillation energy into this bead mode, i.e. set E_bead = E0. Therefore\n  |a_COM,x|max = sqrt[g E0 / (2 m R)].\n\nCombining the condition and the kinematics:\n- Set x := |d/2 − R| and h = sqrt[L^2 − x^2]. The zero-tension condition becomes\n  sqrt[g E0 / (2 m R)] ≥ g x / sqrt[L^2 − x^2].\n- Divide by g and solve for x:\n  sqrt[E0 / (2 m g R)] ≥ x / sqrt[L^2 − x^2]\n  ⇒ x ≤ α sqrt[L^2 − x^2],  where α := sqrt[E0 / (2 m g R)].\n- Square and rearrange:\n  x^2 ≤ α^2 (L^2 − x^2) ⇒ x^2 (1 + α^2) ≤ α^2 L^2\n  ⇒ x^2 ≤ (α^2 / (1 + α^2)) L^2\n  ⇒ x ≤ (L α) / sqrt(1 + α^2).\n- Since x = |d/2 − R|, the largest permissible d occurs when d/2 − R = +x (strings slant inward), i.e.\n  d_max = 2 (R + x_max) = 2R + 2 L α / sqrt(1 + α^2).\n\nIn terms of the given parameters, α = sqrt[E0 / (2 m g R)], so the compact expression is\n  d_max = 2R + 2L sqrt[ E0 / (E0 + 2 m g R) ].\n\nSanity checks and limits:\n- As E0 → 0+, α → 0+, d_max → 2R. With vanishing energy, slack cannot actually occur, but arbitrarily small positive energy allows d arbitrarily close to 2R to be admissible, consistent with “small oscillations.”\n- As E0 grows (still within the small-oscillation regime, i.e. E0 ≪ m g R), d_max increases above 2R. In the formal large-E0 limit of this formula, d_max → 2(R + L), which is the geometric ceiling where each string becomes horizontal (h → 0), as expected.\n\nRemarks on assumptions:\n- We used the small-oscillation linearization, neglected a_COM,y versus g in the alignment condition, and maximized |a_COM,x| by allocating energy to the higher-frequency bead mode. These choices maximize the instantaneous unloading of one support and thus give the sharp upper bound for d allowing a vanishing tension instant. In a two-degree-of-freedom small-oscillation system, with suitable initial phases one can also satisfy the angular momentum balance at the instant of zero tension; thus the force-direction bound derived above is the controlling criterion.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,d_{\\max}\\;=\\;2R\\;+\\;2L\\,\\sqrt{\\dfrac{E_{0}}{E_{0}+2\\,m\\,g\\,R}}\\,}\n\\]"}

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field. The so-called oblate spheroidal coordinate system is similar to spherical coordinates, and it is generated by the following coordinate transformations:\n\n$$\nx= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\cos \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\ny= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\sin \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\nz=a\\mathrm{sh}\\mu\\sin\\nu\n$$  \n\nWe want the shape of the field lines of an electric field or magnetic field to precisely follow its generatrix direction, i.e., the tangent direction of the curve where field strength changes with $\\mu$ while $\\nu,\\varphi$ remain fixed (upwards when $\\relax z>0$). \n\nFind the charge distribution in the $xy$ plane that can produce this electric field distribution.

This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2).

The semi-major axis of the elliptical cylinder's cross section is a, the semi-minor axis is b, and its mass is m. The inner radius of the circular cylinder is R, and its mass is M. The central axes of both the circular cylinder and the elliptical cylinder are horizontal. The magnitude of gravitational acceleration is g. The circular cylinder is fixed and cannot rotate. Initially, the elliptical cylinder is in equilibrium at the bottom of the circular cylinder with its minor axis aligned vertically. Assuming the elliptical cylinder undergoes rolling without slipping inside the circular cylinder, derive the frequency f of the small oscillations of the elliptical cylinder's center of mass near this equilibrium position.\n\nSolution and derivation:\n\n1) Geometry and kinematics setup\n- Work in the 2D cross-section. Let O be the center of the fixed circular cylinder (inner radius R). Let C be the center of mass (and geometric center) of the homogeneous elliptical cylinder.\n- Let n be the inward unit normal of the circular wall at the point of contact (so at the bottom equilibrium n points upward).\n- Let θ be the orientation angle of the ellipse’s major axis with respect to a fixed horizontal axis.\n- Let χ be the absolute angle of n measured from the fixed +x axis. Define its small deviation from the bottom as β via χ = π/2 + β, so β is small near equilibrium.\n- Rolling without slipping between two smooth curves implies:\n  - The arc-length on the circle S and the arc-length on the ellipse s satisfy dS = ds (no slip).\n  - The tangent orientations at the contact are equal, which yields the standard kinematic relation:\n    dθ = (1/R − κ_e) dS,\n    where κ_e is the curvature (in space, equivalently in the body frame) of the ellipse at the instantaneous contact point.\n  - The rate of change of the normal direction is dχ = dS/R, hence β̇ = χ̇ = Ṡ/R.\n\nDefine the body-frame normal angle at contact relative to the major axis by\nδ = χ − θ.\nNear the bottom, χ ≈ π/2 and θ ≈ 0, so δ ≈ π/2.\n\nFrom the no-slip relation,\nθ̇ = (1/R − κ_e) Ṡ = (1 − κ_e R) β̇.\nDenote κ0 = κ_e evaluated at the bottom contact (minor-axis tip), which for an ellipse is\nκ0 = b/a^2.\nThus, to linear order near equilibrium,\nθ̇ = c β̇, with c = 1 − κ0 R = 1 − (bR)/(a^2).\n\nIt is also convenient to define η = δ − π/2 = (χ − θ) − π/2 = β − θ, so that\nη̇ = β̇ − θ̇ = (1/R − (1/R − κ_e)) Ṡ = κ_e Ṡ ≈ κ0 Ṡ = κ0 R β̇.\nHence, to linear order, η ≈ κ0 R β.\n\n2) Support function of the ellipse and center location\nLet h(φ) be the support function of the ellipse (distance from center to tangent line along a normal making angle φ with the major axis):\nh(φ) = sqrt(a^2 cos^2 φ + b^2 sin^2 φ).\nAt the bottom contact, in terms of the body-frame normal angle φ = δ, we have φ0 = π/2 and\nh(φ0) = b,  h′(φ0) = 0,  h″(φ0) = (a^2 − b^2)/b.\n\nThe vector from O to C can be written in terms of the inward normal n as\nr = OC = −[R − h(δ)] n.\nAt bottom, n = +ŷ (upward), so C lies below O by R − b.\n\n3) Energies to quadratic order\n- Kinetic energy:\nThe velocity of the center is v_C = ṙ. To linear order, the radius R − h(δ) can be replaced by R − b (since h′(φ0) = 0 makes first-order changes in h vanish), and the center moves along a circular arc about O with angular speed β̇. Hence\nT_trans = (1/2) m (R − b)^2 β̇^2.\nRotational kinetic energy about the symmetry axis (out of the plane) is\nT_rot = (1/2) I θ̇^2,\nand for a homogeneous solid elliptical cylinder (right cylinder) with cross-section semiaxes a, b,\nI = (m/4)(a^2 + b^2).\nUsing θ̇ = c β̇, we get\nT_rot = (1/2) I c^2 β̇^2.\nThus total kinetic energy\nT = (1/2) [ m (R − b)^2 + I c^2 ] β̇^2.\n\n- Potential energy:\nThe vertical coordinate of the center is\ny_C = r · ŷ = −[R − h(δ)] (n · ŷ).\nNear the bottom, write n · ŷ = 1 − β^2/2 + O(β^4), and expand h(δ) about φ0 = π/2 via δ = π/2 + η:\nh(δ) ≈ b + (1/2) h″(φ0) η^2 = b + (1/2) [(a^2 − b^2)/b] η^2.\nHence\ny_C ≈ −(R − b) + (R − b) (β^2/2) + (1/2) h″(φ0) η^2.\nTherefore the change in gravitational potential (relative to equilibrium) is\nΔV = mg [y_C − (−(R − b))] ≈ (1/2) m g [ (R − b) β^2 + h″(φ0) η^2 ].\nUsing η ≈ κ0 R β, we obtain a purely quadratic potential in β:\nΔV = (1/2) m g [ (R − b) + h″(φ0) (κ0 R)^2 ] β^2,\nwith\nκ0 = b/a^2,  h″(φ0) = (a^2 − b^2)/b.\n\n4) Linear equation of motion and small-oscillation frequency\nUsing L = T − V and the generalized coordinate β, the linearized equation is\n[ m (R − b)^2 + I c^2 ] β̈ + m g [ (R − b) + h″(φ0) (κ0 R)^2 ] β = 0,\nwith c = 1 − κ0 R.\n\nThus the angular frequency ω and ordinary frequency f are\nω^2 = g [ (R − b) + h″(φ0) (κ0 R)^2 ] / [ (R − b)^2 + (I/m) c^2 ],\nf = ω/(2π).\n\nSubstitute I/m = (a^2 + b^2)/4, κ0 = b/a^2, h″(φ0) = (a^2 − b^2)/b, and c = 1 − (bR)/(a^2), to get the explicit result:\n\nω^2 = g [ (R − b) + (a^2 − b^2) b R^2 / a^4 ] / [ (R − b)^2 + (a^2 + b^2)/4 (1 − bR/a^2)^2 ].\n\nTherefore\nf = (1/2π) sqrt{ g [ (R − b) + (a^2 − b^2) b R^2 / a^4 ] / [ (R − b)^2 + (a^2 + b^2)/4 (1 − bR/a^2)^2 ] }.\n\n5) Checks and remarks\n- Circular limit a = b = r:\nh″(φ0) → 0, κ0 → 1/r, c = 1 − R/r = −(R − r)/r, I/m = r^2/2.\nThen\nω^2 = g (R − r) / [ (R − r)^2 + (r^2/2) ( (R − r)^2 / r^2 ) ] = 2g / [3 (R − r)],\nso f = (1/2π) sqrt(2g / [3 (R − r)]), which matches the standard result for a solid cylinder rolling without slipping on the inside of a circular track.\n- The mass M of the outer cylinder does not appear because the outer cylinder is fixed.\n- Validity: small oscillations about the bottom configuration with the ellipse’s minor axis vertical; “small” here also ensures that the contact remains at a single point near the minor-axis extremity and that curvature variations beyond leading order can be neglected.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nf \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\,g\\left[(R-b)\\;+\\;\\dfrac{(a^2-b^2)\\,b\\,R^2}{a^4}\\right]}{\\,(R-b)^2\\;+\\;\\dfrac{a^2+b^2}{4}\\left(1-\\dfrac{bR}{a^2}\\right)^2}}\n}\n\\]"}

A perfectly conducting sphere of radius R, carrying net free charge Q, is embedded in the dielectric. Far from the sphere, the applied electric field is uniform, E → E0 (a constant vector). We are asked for the net electrostatic force on the conducting sphere. The problem statement clarifies that the free charges on the conductor and the polarization charge on the dielectric interface are to be treated as a single mechanical body. In this standard setting, the Maxwell stress tensor method in the homogeneous dielectric gives the net force.\n\n1) Field outside the sphere\n\nBecause the medium outside is homogeneous with permittivity ε, the scalar potential outside the conductor satisfies Laplace’s equation. For a spherical conductor carrying net charge Q in a uniform field E0, the most general, axisymmetric potential decaying at infinity has the form\nφ(r, θ) = −E0 r cosθ + A cosθ / r^2 + B / r + const,\nwhere θ is the polar angle measured from the direction of E0. The boundary condition that the conductor’s surface (r = R) is an equipotential (independent of θ) fixes A:\n−E0 R cosθ + A cosθ / R^2 = 0  ⇒  A = E0 R^3.\nThe coefficient B is fixed by Gauss’s law for the displacement field in the homogeneous medium outside the sphere:\n∮S ε E · dS = Q  ⇒  B = Q / (4π ε).\nThus the potential outside is\nφ(r, θ) = −E0 r cosθ + (E0 R^3 cosθ)/r^2 + (Q/(4π ε)) (1/r) + const.\n\nEquivalently, the electric field outside is the superposition of:\n- the uniform applied field E0,\n- the field of a dipole p = 4π ε R^3 E0 induced by the conductor in the uniform field,\n- the Coulomb field of the net charge Q: EQ(r) = (1/(4π ε)) Q r̂ / r^2.\n\n2) Net force via the Maxwell stress tensor\n\nIn a homogeneous, isotropic dielectric of permittivity ε, the electrostatic Maxwell stress tensor is\nT = ε (E E) − (ε/2) (E · E) I,\nand the net electromagnetic force on any enclosed body is\nF = ∮S T · n dS,\nwhere S is a closed surface lying entirely in the homogeneous dielectric and enclosing the body (here the conductor plus its interfacial bound charge), and n is the outward normal.\n\nChoose S to be a sphere of large radius a centered on the object, with a → ∞. On S, the total field is\nE = E0 + EQ + Ep,\nwhere EQ ∼ 1/a^2 and Ep ∼ 1/a^3. The integral of the stress tensor can be expanded; only terms linear in the decaying fields can contribute a finite result after integration over the area ~ a^2. The dipole field Ep produces contributions of order (1/a^3) × a^2 → 0, so it does not contribute to the net force. The only surviving contribution comes from the cross term between the uniform field E0 and the monopole field EQ.\n\nWrite E = E0 + e with e ≡ EQ. Then, keeping only terms linear in e,\nT ≈ ε (E0 e + e E0 − (E0 · e) I).\nThe force is therefore\nF = ∮S ε [ (E0 · n) e + (e · n) E0 − (E0 · e) n ] dS.\nOn the large sphere S, e is purely radial:\ne = EQ = k n, with k = Q / (4π ε a^2),\nand E0 · n = E0 cosθ, E0 · e = k E0 cosθ. Substituting,\nintegrand = ε [ (E0 cosθ) k n + k E0 − k E0 cosθ n ] = ε k E0,\nwhich is independent of angle. Therefore\nF = ∮S ε k E0 dS = ε k E0 (4π a^2) = ε (Q / (4π ε a^2)) E0 (4π a^2) = Q E0.\nThis result is a vector pointing along E0 (for Q > 0) or opposite E0 (for Q < 0). Importantly, it is independent of εr and R. Physically, in a uniform field the induced (dipolar) polarization produces no net force; only the interaction of the uniform field with the net charge Q contributes, yielding exactly Q E0 when the interfacial bound charges are included as part of the body.\n\nAs a consistency check, one may also use the energy method: translating the charged sphere by a small displacement δx in a uniform field changes the electrostatic energy by −Q E0 · δx, implying F = Q E0, identical to the stress-tensor result.\n\nResult:\n- Vector form: F = Q E0.\n- Magnitude: F = |Q| E0.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{F = |Q|\\,E_{0}\\quad\\text{(with vector form }\\,\\vec{F}=Q\\,\\vec{E}_{0}\\text{)}}\\]"}

The initial conditions are: position $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ and velocity $(v_{\\perp}\\cos\\delta,v_{\\perp}\\sin\\delta,v_{z})$.\n\nWe know that a particle in a uniform magnetic field undergoes circular Larmor gyration, and the center of this rotation is called the guiding center. The drift velocity of this guiding center due to the electric field can be expressed using $\\pmb{E},\\pmb{B}$ and their magnitudes.\n\nProblem: We discuss the case where the magnetic field is uniform, but the electric field is non-uniform. For simplicity, we assume $\\pmb{E}$ is in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction and varies sinusoidally in the $\\pmb{y}$ direction.\n\n$$\n\\pmb{E} \\equiv E_{0}\\cos(k y)\\hat{\\pmb{x}}\n$$\n\nIn reality, such a charge distribution can occur in a plasma during wave propagation. Find the corresponding guiding center drift velocity. It is known that the electric field is very weak, and the particle's initial position is $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$. Approximate to the lowest order that can distinguish from the uniform electric field case.", "solutions": "This problem has been modified; the original problem had four questions.\n\nIf there is an electric field present, we find that the motion of the particle will be a combination of two movements: the normal circular Larmor gyration and a drift towards the center of guidance. We can choose the $\\pmb{x}$ axis along the direction of $\\pmb{E}$, so $\\pmb{E}_{y}=0$, and the velocity components related to transverse components can be treated separately. The equation of motion is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d v}{d t}}=q({\\pmb{E}}+v\\times{\\pmb{B}})\n$$  \n\nIts $\\pmb{z}$ component is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{z}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{z}\n$$  \n\nIntegrating yields  \n\n$$\nv_{\\tau}=\\frac{q E_{z}}{m}t+v_{z0}\n$$  \n\nThis is a simple motion along the direction of $\\pmb{B}$. The transverse components of the previous equation are  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\upsilon_{x}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\upsilon_{y}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\upsilon_{y}}{d t}=0\\pm\\omega_{c}\\upsilon_{x}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{c}\\equiv{\\frac{|g|B}{m}}$ is the Larmor gyration angular frequency. Differentiating these two equations gives  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{x}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})\n$$  \n\nWe can rewrite the above equations as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})=-\\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})\n$$  \n\nTherefore, if we use $\\begin{array}{r}{v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B}}\\end{array}$ instead of ${\\pmb v_{\\pmb y}}$, the equation simplifies to the situation when the electric field is zero. Thus, the two equations can be replaced by  \n\n$$\nv_{x}=v_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{\\mathrm{e}}t+\\delta)}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\upsilon_{y}=-i\\upsilon_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the angle between the component of the particle's initial velocity in the $_{xy}$ plane ${\\pmb v}_{\\bot}$ and the $\\pmb{x}$ axis (counter-clockwise direction). Further integration and taking the real part yields the equations of motion  \n\n$$\nx=x_{0}+\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{\\omega_{c}}\\sin(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)\n$$  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}t+\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{\\omega_{c}}[1-\\cos(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)]\n$$  \n\n$$\nz=\\frac{q E_{z}}{2m}t^{2}+v_{z0}t+z_{0}\n$$  \n\nFrom the equations of motion, it is observed that the Larmor motion of the particle is identical to the case without an electric field, but there is a drift superimposed in the $-y$ direction towards the center of guidance ${\\pmb v}_{{\\pmb g}{\\pmb c}}$ (for $E_{z}>0)$.\n\nTo obtain the general formula for ${\\pmb v}_{{\\pmb g}{\\pmb c}}$, we can solve the equation (1) using vector form. Since we already know that the term $\\textstyle m{\\frac{d v}{d t}}$ only gives rise to circular motion with frequency $\\omega_{c}$, this term can be ignored in equation (1). Thus, equation (1) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{{ E}}+\\pmb{{\\upsilon}}\\times\\pmb{{ B}}=0\n$$  \n\nBy taking the cross product of $\\pmb{B}$ with the above expression, we get  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{E}\\times\\pmb{B}=\\pmb{B}\\times(\\pmb{v}\\times\\pmb{B})=\\pmb{v}\\pmb{B}^{2}-\\pmb{B}(\\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{B})\n$$  \n\nThe transverse component of this equation is  \n\n$$\nv_{\\perp q c}=E\\times B/B^{2}\\equiv v_{E}\n$$  \n\nWe define this transverse component as $\\pmb{v}_{E}$, which is the electric field drift towards the center of guidance.\n\nThe equation of motion for the particle is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d{\\boldsymbol{v}}}{d t}}=q[{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{y}})+{\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times{\\boldsymbol{B}}]\n$$  \n\nDecomposing into scalar form, we have  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{x}=\\frac{q B}{m}v_{y}+\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}(y)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{y}=-\\frac{q B}{m}v_{x}\n$$  \n\nSimplifying yields  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{\\upsilon}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\upsilon_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\frac{\\dot{E}_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\pmb{E_{x}}(\\pmb{y})$ is the electric field at the particle's location. To compute this value, we need to know the particle's trajectory, which is precisely what we attempt to solve initially. If the electric field is weak, as a first approximation, we can estimate $E_{x}(y)$ using the undisturbed trajectory.\n\nThe trajectory in the absence of an electric field is given by  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{r_{L}=\\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{|q|B}}\\end{array}$ is the Larmor gyration radius, and we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)\n$$  \n\nWe seek a solution that is the sum of the gyration at $\\omega_{c}$ and a stationary drift $_{v_{E}}$. Since we are interested in expressing $v_{E}$, we can average over one cycle to eliminate the gyration motion. Thus, the equation yields  \n\n$$\n\\bar{v}_{x}=0\n$$  \n\nIn the above equation, the average of the oscillating term $\\ddot{v}_{y}$ is clearly zero, giving us  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\ddot{v}}}_{y}=0=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\overline{{v}}_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\overline{{\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)}}\n$$  \n\nUpon expanding the small approximation and averaging, we find  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{v}}_{y}=-\\frac{E_{x}(y_{0})}{B}(1-\\frac{1}{4}k^{2}r_{L}^{2})\n$$  \n\nThus, due to non-uniformity, the usual $\\pmb{{E}}\\times\\pmb{{B}}$ drift is modified to  \n\n$$\n\\boxed{v_{E}={\\frac{E\\times B}{B^{2}}}(1-{\\frac{1}{4}}{(k \\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{\\vert{q}\\vert B})}^2)}\n$$  \n\nThe correction term represents the finite Larmor radius effect under the sinusoidal electric field distribution.", "final_answers": "$$\nv_E = \\frac{E \\times B}{B^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left(k \\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q| B}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$", "improved_solutions": "We are given a static, spatially nonuniform electric field\nE(x,y) = E0 cos(k y) x̂\nand a uniform magnetic field B = B ẑ. The particle is magnetized (E0 “weak”), so it executes fast Larmor gyration at cyclotron frequency Ωc and a slow guiding-center drift. The cyclotron frequency and Larmor radius are\nΩc ≡ qB/m,  ρL ≡ v⊥/|Ωc|,\n\nwith v⊥ the initial perpendicular speed. The dominant perpendicular drift in a static field is the E × B drift, which for arbitrary spatial dependence is, instantaneously,\nvE(t) = E(x(t),y(t)) × B / B^2 = −(E0/B) cos(k y(t)) ŷ.\n\nTo obtain the guiding-center drift, we average vE(t) over the fast gyromotion at fixed guiding-center position Rgc. For uniform B, the perpendicular orbit can be written as\nr⊥(t) = Rgc + ρ(t),  with  ρ(t) · ẑ = 0,  |ρ| = ρL,\nand we may take, without loss of generality, y(t) = Ygc + ρL cos(Ωc t + ϕ), where Ygc is the guiding-center y-coordinate and ϕ is the gyrophase.\n\nThen the gyroaveraged E × B drift is\n⟨vE⟩ = −(E0/B) ⟨cos(k[ Ygc + ρL cos(Ωc t + ϕ)])⟩ ŷ.\n\nUse the standard Bessel-function identity\n(1/2π) ∫0^{2π} cos(a + b cos θ) dθ = cos a J0(b),\nto obtain\n⟨vE⟩ = −(E0/B) J0(k ρL) cos(k Ygc) ŷ.\n\nThis is the exact guiding-center E × B drift for uniform B and static E(y); it shows a finite-Larmor-radius (FLR) attenuation factor J0(k ρL), independent of the sign of q, as expected for E × B drift.\n\nBecause the electric field is weak, the guiding center moves slowly compared to the cyclotron motion. To lowest order in the drift ordering, we can evaluate the drift at the initial guiding-center position, which is equal to the initial particle position up to an O(ρL) phase-dependent offset that averages out. Thus, to the first nontrivial order that differentiates the result from the uniform-field (k → 0) case, we may set Ygc ≈ y0 and expand J0 for small k ρL:\nJ0(k ρL) ≈ 1 − (k^2 ρL^2)/4 + O((k ρL)^4).\n\nTherefore, the guiding-center drift at t = 0 is\nvgc,⊥ ≈ −(E0/B) [1 − (k^2 ρL^2)/4] cos(k y0) ŷ,\nwith no drift in x, and vgc,z = 0 (while vz is constant to this order since E has no z-component). In the uniform-field limit k → 0 (or k ρL → 0), this reduces to the usual constant drift −(E0/B) ŷ.\n\nSummary of ingredients:\n- Ωc = qB/m,  ρL = v⊥/|Ωc|\n- Exact gyroaveraged drift: vgc = −(E0/B) J0(k ρL) cos(k Ygc) ŷ\n- Lowest-order approximation about the initial position: replace Ygc → y0 and J0 → 1 − (k^2 ρL^2)/4.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{\\ \\pmb{v}_{\\mathrm{gc}} \\simeq -\\,\\frac{E_0}{B}\\,\\Big(1-\\frac{k^2\\rho_L^2}{4}\\Big)\\cos(k\\,y_0)\\,\\hat{\\pmb{y}},\\quad \\rho_L=\\frac{v_\\perp}{|q|B/m}\\ }\\]"}

{"id": "MECHANICS/716", "questions": "The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q. A lightweight, smooth-walled insulating thin tube can rotate around a vertical axis through point O in the horizontal plane. At a distance L from point O inside the tube, there is a photoelectric trigger control switch A. A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined. If the distance OB is measured to be $L/2$, determine the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube when the ball is at point B.

The process is inelastic scattering that raises X2 from its ground state (rest mass M0 = E_1/c^2) to the excited state (rest mass M* = E_2/c^2), after which X2 can emit a photon in its decay. The emitted photon does not affect the threshold to produce the excitation.\n\nUse the invariant s = (P_target + k)^2. Initially, with X2 at rest and a massless projectile of energy E, we have\ns = M0^2 c^4 + 2 M0 c^2 E.\n\nThe minimal energy E needed to produce the excited target (mass M*) and a scattered massless projectile is obtained by requiring s ≥ M*^2 c^4, and the minimum occurs at the kinematic threshold:\nM0^2 c^4 + 2 M0 c^2 E_min = M*^2 c^4\n⇒ E_min = (M*^2 - M0^2) c^2 / (2 M0)\n        = Δ [ 1 + Δ / (2 M0 c^2) ].\n\nHere M0 c^2 = E_1 = √3 M c^2 and Δ = E_2 - E_1 from above, so:\nE1 = Δ [ 1 + Δ / (2 E_1) ]\n   = M c^2 ( (√15)/2 - √3 ) [ 1 + ( (√15)/2 - √3 ) / (2 √3) ].\n\nThis simplifies elegantly. Let A = √3 and B = √15/2. Then Δ = M c^2 (B - A), E_1 = A M c^2. Therefore\nE1 = (M c^2) (B - A) [ 1 + (B - A)/(2 A) ]\n   = (M c^2) (B - A) (A + B) / (2 A)\n   = (M c^2) (B^2 - A^2) / (2 A).\n\nSince B^2 = 15/4 and A^2 = 3, we have B^2 - A^2 = 15/4 - 3 = 3/4.

The center of the sphere is suspended at a height H>R above the ground. Establish a Cartesian coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical, the ground is at z=0, and the sphere's center is located at (0,0,H). The sphere rotates uniformly with an angular velocity vector along the x direction, and the magnitude is ω. Consider a droplet of water being flung off the surface of the sphere, and then follows a trajectory under the influence of gravity.\n\nIf the angular velocity is too small, water droplets cannot be flung off the top, so there's a minimum angular velocity ω1.\n\nWhen the angular velocity ω>ω1, there is still a region on the sphere where droplets cannot be normally flung off. Find the equation of the curve projecting the boundary of this region onto the xy-plane (express this as an equation involving y^2 in terms of x).\nAnswer:\n\nSetup and dynamics:\n- Let the sphere’s center be at C = (0,0,H). For a surface point P, define its coordinates relative to the center as r_c = (x, y, z_c) with z_c = z − H. The sphere is given by x^2 + y^2 + z_c^2 = R^2.\n- The sphere rotates with angular velocity vector ω = (ω, 0, 0) (about the x-axis through the center). The droplet (while in contact with the rotating surface) has instantaneous velocity\n  v = ω × r_c = (0, −ω z_c, ω y),\n  so its speed is\n  v^2 = ω^2(y^2 + z_c^2) = ω^2(R^2 − x^2).\n\nNormal-force (detachment) criterion:\n- Let n_r be the outward radial unit vector at P. The inward radial (toward center) direction is e_in = −n_r.\n- The centripetal acceleration needed to remain on the spherical surface is a_in = v^2/R (toward the center).\n- The component of gravity mg along the inward radial direction is F_g,in = m g (k̂ · n_r) = m g (z_c/R), since n_r = r_c/R and k̂ · n_r = z_c/R.\n- Summing forces along the inward radial direction gives\n  −N + m g (z_c/R) = m v^2/R,\n  where N is the outward normal force from the surface on the droplet. Thus\n  N = m (g z_c − v^2)/R.\n- Detachment occurs when N = 0, i.e.\n  v^2 = g z_c.\n  Using v^2 = ω^2(R^2 − x^2), the detachment boundary satisfies\n  ω^2(R^2 − x^2) = g z_c\n  ⇒ z_c = (ω^2/g)(R^2 − x^2).\n\nMinimum angular speed at the very top:\n- At the top of the sphere: (x, y, z_c) = (0, 0, R). The detachment condition gives ω^2 R^2 = g R ⇒ ω1 = sqrt(g/R).\n\nProjection of the boundary onto the xy-plane:\n- Points on the boundary lie on the sphere and satisfy z_c = (ω^2/g)(R^2 − x^2). Substitute into x^2 + y^2 + z_c^2 = R^2:\n  x^2 + y^2 + [ (ω^2/g)(R^2 − x^2) ]^2 = R^2.\n- Solve for y^2 in terms of x:\n  y^2 = R^2 − x^2 − (ω^4/g^2)(R^2 − x^2)^2.\n\nDomain (where the projection is real):\n- We require y^2 ≥ 0, which imposes (R^2 − x^2)[1 − (ω^4/g^2)(R^2 − x^2)] ≥ 0. Since R^2 − x^2 ≥ 0 on the sphere, this gives R^2 − x^2 ≤ g^2/ω^4, i.e.\n  |x| ≥ sqrt(R^2 − (g/ω^2)^2), with |x| ≤ R.\n- Note H drops out; the boundary is purely geometric/dynamic, independent of the height above ground (for H>R the sphere is fully above the ground).\n\nSummary:\n- Minimum angular velocity for the topmost point to eject is ω1 = sqrt(g/R).\n- For any ω > ω1, the projection onto the xy-plane of the boundary separating regions that cannot be normally flung off (N ≥ 0) from those that are ejected (N < 0) is given by the curve\n\ny^2 = R^2 − x^2 − (ω^4/g^2)(R^2 − x^2)^2,\n\nwith the real locus restricted to the x-interval where the right-hand side is nonnegative (equivalently R^2 − x^2 ≤ g^2/ω^4).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{\\,y^2 \\;=\\; R^2 - x^2 \\;-\\; \\frac{\\omega^4}{g^2}\\,\\bigl(R^2 - x^2\\bigr)^2\\,}\\]"}

For a stratified (y-dependent) index, the tangential component of the wavevector is conserved, giving the ray invariant\nn(y) sin θ(y) = C, where C ≡ n0 sin i = sin i.\nHence, throughout the film,\nsin θ(y) = C / n(y), and cos θ(y) = sqrt(1 - (C/n)^2) = sqrt(n^2(y) - C^2)/n(y).\n\nWe consider two beams:\n- Beam A: enters at Q (x = 0), propagates up to the upper surface y = d, reflects (ignore reflection phase), and returns to the lower surface, exiting into air at P (x = 2S).\n- Beam B: the adjacent incident beam that hits at P directly (the incident points of adjacent beams are separated by 2S) and is reflected at the lower surface (ignore reflection phase).\n\nThese two beams leave point P into air along the same direction (angle i), and therefore can interfere. The phase difference at P (immediately after the reflection/transmission events) equals the difference between the accumulated phases along their respective paths from the same incident plane wave.\n\nWrite the phase difference as\nφ = k0 [OPL_A − OPL_B],\nwith k0 = 2π/λ and OPL the optical path length measured from the same incident plane wave to the point P just after the events. Let us decompose this:\n\n- The phase of beam B at P equals the phase of the incident field at P (reflection phase neglected).\n- The phase of beam A at P equals the phase of the incident field at Q plus the optical phase accumulated inside the film along the up-and-down path.\n\nAt the lower surface (y = 0), the phase of the incident plane wave varies along x as exp[i kx x], with kx = k0 n0 sin i = k0 sin i.

The total charge is nQ, so the leading term is the monopole V ∼ (1/4π ε0)(nQ)/r.\n- The array has discrete rotational symmetry of order 2n about the z-axis. As a result, all non-axisymmetric spherical-harmonic components with azimuthal order m not a multiple of 2n cancel when summing over the n rings. The leading non-axisymmetric term appears at m = 2n and scales like (R/r)^{2n+1}, which is negligible for r ≫ R and n ≥ 2. To leading order, the potential in the equatorial plane is therefore central and determined by the m = 0 (axisymmetric) part of the multipole expansion.\n\n2) Axisymmetric multipole expansion from one ring and sum over n rings\n- Let a single ring lie in the xz-plane: r'(α) = (R cos α, 0, R sin α), with uniform line charge density λ = Q/(2πR).\n- The m = 0 multipole coefficient for degree l is\n  a_{l0} = λ ∫_ring R^l Y_{l0}^*(Ω') dℓ' = λ R^{l+1} sqrt((2l+1)/(4π)) ∫_0^{2π} P_l(sin α) dα,\n  so defining I_l ≡ ∫_0^{2π} P_l(sin α) dα gives\n  a_{l0} = Q R^l sqrt((2l+1)/(4π)) (I_l / (2π)).\n- Only even l contribute (I_l = 0 for odd l).

On the equatorial plane θ = π/2 (cos θ = 0), using P_0(0) = 1 and P_2(0) = −1/2, one gets to order R^2/r^3:\n  V_eq(r) = (1/(4π ε0)) nQ [ 1/r − (1/8) (R^2 / r^3) + O((R/r)^4) ].\n\n3) Dynamics of the negative charge −q at radius r0 ≫ R\n- Let q' = −q (negative test charge).

Non-axisymmetric terms appear only at order (R/r0)^{2n+1} and are negligible for n ≥ 2 and r0 ≫ R; higher even-l, m = 0 terms are O((R/r0)^4) and smaller, and have been omitted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{T_r - T_\\theta \\;\\approx\\; -\\,\\frac{3}{8}\\,\\frac{R^2}{r_0^2}\\,T_0,\\quad T_0 \\;=\\; 2\\pi\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi\\,\\epsilon_0\\,m\\,r_0^3}{n\\,Q\\,q}}\\,;\\;\\; \\text{equivalently, }\\; \\omega_r - \\omega_\\theta \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{3}{8}\\,\\omega_0\\,\\frac{R^2}{r_0^2},\\; \\omega_0^2=\\frac{nQq}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m r_0^3}}\\]"}

A and D are two objects both with mass m, connected by a light and thin rope that passes over the fixed pulleys. Initially, the system is stationary, and the distances AB and CD are both measured along the rope in the direction of gravity, where AB = x0 and CD = L (L is large so D never hits C over the time of interest). At t = 0, ball A is pulled so that AB deviates from the vertical by a small angle θ0 (without changing the length AB), and the system is released. Taking gravitational acceleration as g, and assuming that A descends very slowly so that the length of AB can be taken approximately constant during one oscillation, A executes a pendulum-like motion. Find the amplitude of the oscillation angle θ of A when AB = x.\n\nSolution and reasoning:\n\n1) Geometry and constraints\n- The rope runs along three straight segments: AB (length x), the top horizontal span BC (fixed length d), and CD (length y). Because the pulleys are fixed and ideal and the rope is inextensible,\n  x + y + d = constant ⇒ y = (x0 + L + d) − d − x = L + (x0 − x).\n- Thus, as AB increases (A descends), CD decreases (D ascends), and vice versa.\n\n2) Fast and slow dynamics separation\n- On the fast timescale (one swing period), treat the pendulum length as frozen at x. A then behaves as a small-angle pendulum of length x about the fixed pivot B.\n- On the slow timescale, the rope can slide over pulley B because the time-averaged rope tension pulling up on D is not exactly mg. This produces a slow drift of x(t). The problem states this drift is slow enough that x can be considered constant during each oscillation, which is the regime of adiabatic invariance.\n\n3) Small-angle pendulum dynamics at fixed x\n- For a pendulum of length x with small angular displacement θ(t), the kinetic and potential energies (to quadratic order in θ) are:\n  T = (1/2) m x^2 θ̇^2,\n  V ≈ (1/2) m g x θ^2.\n- Hence the Hamiltonian (mechanical energy of A) at fixed x is\n  E_A = (1/2) m x^2 θ̇^2 + (1/2) m g x θ^2.\n  This is a harmonic oscillator in θ with angular frequency\n  ω(x) = sqrt(g/x).\n\nIf θ(t) = Θ cos[ω(x) t + φ], then the amplitude Θ satisfies\n  E_A = (1/2) m g x Θ^2.\n\n4) Why x increases slowly (consistency check)\n- The rope tension on the AB segment is\n  T = m g cos θ + m x θ̇^2.\n- Averaging over one small-amplitude cycle with θ(t) = Θ cos(ω t), and using 〈cos θ〉 ≈ 1 − 〈θ^2〉/2 = 1 − Θ^2/4 and 〈θ̇^2〉 = (1/2) Θ^2 ω^2 = (1/2) Θ^2 (g/x), we get\n  〈T〉 ≈ m g (1 − Θ^2/4) + m x [ (1/2) Θ^2 (g/x) ]\n       = m g [1 − Θ^2/4 + Θ^2/2]\n       = m g [1 + Θ^2/4] > m g.\n- Therefore, on average, D feels an upward net force 〈T〉 − mg > 0 and slowly rises; thus y decreases and x increases. This justifies the assumption that A “descends very slowly.”\n\n5) Adiabatic invariant and amplitude evolution\n- For a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with slowly varying parameter, the action\n  J = (1/2π) ∮ p dq\n  is an adiabatic invariant.\n- Here the canonical coordinate is q = θ and the conjugate momentum is p = ∂L/∂θ̇ = m x^2 θ̇ (with x treated as constant over one cycle).\n- For a harmonic oscillator H = p^2/(2M) + (1/2)K q^2, the action is J = E/ω, where ω = sqrt(K/M). In our case,\n  M = m x^2, K = m g x, ω(x) = sqrt(g/x).\n- Therefore,\n  J = E_A / ω(x) = [(1/2) m g x Θ^2] / sqrt(g/x)\n    = (1/2) m √g x^(3/2) Θ^2.\n- Since x varies slowly, J is approximately conserved:\n  (1/2) m √g x^(3/2) Θ(x)^2 = (1/2) m √g x0^(3/2) θ0^2.\n- Solving for the amplitude Θ(x) gives\n  Θ(x) = θ0 (x0 / x)^(3/4).\n\nThis is the leading-order result for the angular amplitude at the moment when AB = x, valid under the assumptions:\n- small angles throughout the evolution, and\n- slow (adiabatic) variation of x compared to the oscillation period, as stated in the problem.\n\n6) Physical interpretation\n- As x slowly increases (A descends), the small-angle frequency ω = sqrt(g/x) decreases. To keep J invariant, the amplitude must decrease as Θ ∝ x^(−3/4). The energy of the pendulum, E_A = (1/2) m g x Θ^2, then scales like E_A ∝ x^(−1/2), so the pendulum gives up energy, which goes into lifting D.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{\\Theta(x)\\;\\approx\\;\\theta_{0}\\,\\Big(\\dfrac{x_{0}}{x}\\Big)^{3/4}}\\]"}

Because radiation at different wavelengths is mutually incoherent, the total intensity is the sum of the two interference patterns:\n  I(y) = I(λ1) + I(λ2) = 2I0[1 + cos(2π δ/λ1)] + 2I0[1 + cos(2π δ/λ2)].\n  Using the trigonometric identity cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A − B)/2] cos[(A + B)/2], we get\n  I(y) = 4I0 [ 1 + cos((k1 − k2) δ/2) cos((k1 + k2) δ/2) ],\n  where ki = 2π/λi.

We have:\n- N = 20 (vertices),\n- m = 30 (edges).\n\nStep 1: Use Foster’s First Theorem on the all-equal network\nFor a connected network with unit resistors on each edge, Foster’s first theorem states:\nSum over all edges e = (u,v) of R_eff(u,v) = N − 1.\n\nBecause the dodecahedral graph is edge-transitive, in the all-equal case (each edge has resistance r), the effective resistance between the endpoints of any edge is the same; call it R0. Hence\nm · (R0/r) = N − 1  ⇒  R0 = r · (N − 1)/m = r · 19/30.\n\nThus, for the regular dodecahedron with all edge resistances equal to r, the effective resistance between any two adjacent vertices is\nR0 = (19/30) r.\n\nStep 2: Extract the “rest-of-network” equivalent between B and C (with the BC edge removed)\nLet R_rest denote the equivalent resistance between B and C through all paths other than the direct BC edge.

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved.

What is the subsequent change in velocity?", "solutions": "By noticing that the cutting of the magnetic field by the wire induces an electromotive force, which in turn generates Ampere force and torque, the motion state of the sphere changes. Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical. This results in no current through the cross-shaped wires in the center.   \n\nOnly the circular arcs perpendicular to the ${\\pmb x}$ direction have current, with the electromotive force given by:\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-\\pi R^{2}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nThus, the current is:\n\n$$\nI={\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2\\pi R\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nThe $\\pmb{\\mathscr{x}}$ component of the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{x}=I S=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{\\vec{B}}\n$$  \n\nIn the rest frame, the magnetic field rotates at an angular velocity of $-\\alpha$ (referring to the angular velocity of the sphere's rotation).

Each wire has resistance per unit length λ, so each full loop has resistance R_loop = 2πλR. The area of each loop is A = πR^2.\n- The three loops share a single connection point (this does not affect the individual loop emfs around each closed loop; translation in a uniform B gives no net emf).\n\nInitial condition: The center has horizontal speed v0, and the sphere is in pure rolling initially.

Its potential for r > a′ is\n  Φim(r,θ) = (m′ / 4π) ∑_{l=1}^∞ l (a′^{l−1} / r^{l+1}) P_l(cosθ).\n- The total potential outside the sphere is Φ = Φm + Φim, and Hr = −∂Φ/∂r. Differentiating term-by-term gives\n  ∂Φm/∂r = (m / 4π) ∑_{l=1}^∞ l(l+1) (r^{l−1} / a^{l+2}) P_l(cosθ),\n  ∂Φim/∂r = −(m′ / 4π) ∑_{l=1}^∞ l(l+1) (a′^{l−1} / r^{l+2}) P_l(cosθ).\n- Therefore,\n  Hr(r,θ) = −∂Φ/∂r\n           = −(m / 4π) ∑_{l=1}^∞ l(l+1) (r^{l−1} / a^{l+2}) P_l(cosθ)\n             + (m′ / 4π) ∑_{l=1}^∞ l(l+1) (a′^{l−1} / r^{l+2}) P_l(cosθ).\n\nBoundary condition at r = R:\n- Enforce Hr(R,θ) = 0 for all θ, which requires that the coefficient of each P_l(cosθ) vanish:\n  −m R^{l−1} / a^{l+2} + m′ a′^{l−1} / R^{l+2} = 0,  for all l ≥ 1.\n- Rearranging,\n  m′/m = R^{2l+1} / (a^{l+2} a′^{l−1}).\n- For this to hold for all l, the dependence on l must cancel. This is achieved by choosing the image position\n  a′ = R^2 / a,\n  which then yields\n  m′/m = R^3 / a^3,\n  independent of l.\n\nConclusion:\n- The field outside the superconducting sphere can indeed be represented as the superposition of the real dipole and an image dipole located at z = a′ = R^2/a, with the same orientation as m and with magnitude\n  m′ = m (R^3 / a^3).\n- Note on interpretation of a: Here a is the distance from the sphere center to the dipole. If instead a denotes the height above the sphere surface, replace a by (R + a) in the formula.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{m' \\;=\\; m\\,\\left(\\dfrac{R}{a}\\right)^{3}}\\]"}

The azimuthal angle is θ, and we consider an in-plane flexural mode of circumferential order m, i.e., with angular dependence cos(mθ) or sin(mθ). For Ω much smaller than the natural frequencies, the effect of rotation enters to first order through Coriolis coupling; changes of stiffness due to centrifugal tension are O(Ω^2) and may be neglected.\n\n1) Non-rotating ring: modal doublet and frequency\n\nIn the non-rotating case (Ω = 0), the two in-plane standing-wave shapes of order m,\n- φc(θ) = cos(mθ),\n- φs(θ) = sin(mθ),\nare degenerate: they have the same natural angular frequency ω0(m). For a thin, inextensional in-plane flexural mode of a circular ring (m ≥ 2), one well-known estimate is\nω0^2(m) = (E I)/(ρ A R^4) × m^2 (m^2 − 1)^2,\nwith I = π r^4/4 and A = π r^2.\n(If an extensional family is considered instead, a different ω0(m) applies; nothing in the precession result below depends on the explicit value of ω0 as long as the pair is degenerate and Ω ≪ ω0.)\n\n2) Effect of rotation: gyroscopic (Coriolis) coupling\n\nWork in the frame rotating with angular velocity Ω about the ring normal. In that frame the linearized equation of motion contains the Coriolis acceleration 2 Ω × u̇, which mixes the two orthogonal standing-wave components. Let the generalized coordinates associated with φc and φs be a(t) and b(t). Because φc and φs are orthogonal and have the same inertia and stiffness in the non-rotating ring, the non-rotating equations are\nM ä + K a = 0,\nM b̈ + K b = 0,\nwith M and K the modal mass and stiffness (so that ω0^2 = K/M).\n\nProjecting the Coriolis term onto the modal subspace gives the standard gyroscopic-coupled two-mode system (the key point is that ∂/∂θ acting on cos(mθ), sin(mθ) produces a factor m and rotates the basis):\nM ä + K a + 2 m Ω M ḃ = 0,\nM b̈ + K b − 2 m Ω M ȧ = 0.\n\nEquivalently, in matrix form\nM q̈ + 2 m Ω M J q̇ + K q = 0,\nwhere q = [a, b]^T and J = [ [0, 1], [−1, 0] ].\n\nSeek harmonic solutions q(t) ∝ e^{−i ω t}. Substitution yields\n[ (K − M ω^2) I − (−i ω)(2 m Ω M) J ] q = 0.\nThe characteristic equation is\n(ω0^2 − ω^2)^2 = (2 m Ω ω)^2.\n\nSolving for ω (retaining the physically relevant, positive roots) gives\nω± = √(ω0^2 + m^2 Ω^2) ± m Ω = ω0 ± m Ω + O(Ω^2),\nfor Ω ≪ ω0. Thus, rotation lifts the degeneracy of the m-doublet into a pair split by\nΔω = ω+ − ω− = 2 m Ω + O(Ω^3/ω0^2).\n\nMode interpretation:\n- The two split modes correspond to counter-propagating traveling waves with azimuthal dependence e^{± i mθ} whose frequencies are ω0 ± m Ω to first order. This is the familiar rotation-induced (Coriolis/Sagnac-like) frequency splitting proportional to mΩ.\n\n3) Standing-wave precession\n\nA standing wave of order m is formed by superposing equal-amplitude counter-propagating traveling waves. Using the two split frequencies,\nu(θ, t) ∝ cos(mθ − (ω0 + m Ω) t) + cos(mθ + (ω0 − m Ω) t).\nApply the sum identity cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A−B)/2] to obtain\nu(θ, t) ∝ 2 cos(mθ − m Ω t) cos(ω0 t).\n\nInterpretation:\n- The factor cos(ω0 t) is the temporal vibration at the central frequency (up to O(Ω^2) corrections).\n- The spatial phase is cos(mθ − m Ω t) = cos[m(θ − Ω t)], which means the entire standing-wave pattern (the nodal/antinodal structure) rigidly rotates with angular velocity Ω. In particular, the antinode angles satisfy m(θ − Ω t) = constant, i.e., θ̇ = Ω.\n\nTherefore, the antinodes of the standing wave precess at an angular velocity equal to the frame (or input) rotation rate Ω, independent of m, R, ρ, E, r (to first order in Ω/ω0). The sign is the same as the sign of Ω.\n\nRemarks on approximations:\n- We have kept terms to first order in Ω/ω0. Centrifugal stiffening (∝ Ω^2) only shifts ω0 by O(Ω^2) and does not change the first-order precession rate.\n- The result is generic for any degenerate azimuthal doublet: the precession of the standing-wave pattern equals the applied rotation rate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{\\delta\\omega \\;=\\; \\Omega}\\]"}

Then\n  N = (S p/(m g)) (e^{x} - 1)  ⇒  e^{x} = 1 + (N m g)/(S p),  e^{-x} = S p/(S p + N m g).\n\n2) Reversible adiabatic condition (isentropic)\n- The process is slow and walls are insulated; with negligible dissipation, it is reversible adiabatic, so dS = 0.\n- The entropy of a classical ideal gas in an external potential U(z)=m g z with uniform T can be written as\n  S = N k [const + (f/2) ln T + ln V_eff(T,H)],\n  where f is the number of quadratic degrees of freedom per molecule (for a diatomic without vibration, f=5), and\n  V_eff(T,H) = S ∫_0^H e^{-α z} dz = S (1 - e^{-α H})/α = S (k T/(m g)) (1 - e^{-x}).\n  The “effective volume” V_eff accounts for the Boltzmann factor in the gravitational field.\n\n- Therefore, along a reversible adiabatic (isentropic) path:\n  0 = dS/(N k) = (f/2) d ln T + d ln V_eff(T,H).\n\n- Compute d ln V_eff:\n  ln V_eff = ln S + ln(k T/(m g)) + ln(1 - e^{-x}), with x = (m g H)/(k T).\n  Thus\n  d ln V_eff = d ln T + d ln(1 - e^{-x}).\n  Now dx = α dH - x dT/T, and\n  d ln(1 - e^{-x}) = [e^{-x}/(1 - e^{-x})] dx = [1/(e^{x} - 1)] (α dH - x dT/T).\n\n- Plug into dS=0:\n  0 = (f/2) d ln T + d ln T + [1/(e^{x} - 1)] (α dH - x dT/T)\n    = [ (f/2 + 1) - x/(e^{x}-1) ] dT/T + [α/(e^{x}-1)] dH.\n\n- Use dx = α dH - x dT/T to eliminate dH. Multiply the above equation by 1 and replace α dH by dx + x dT/T:\n  [ (f/2 + 1) - x/(e^{x}-1) ] dT/T + [1/(e^{x}-1)] (dx + x dT/T) = 0\n  ⇒ [ (f/2 + 1) ] dT/T + [1/(e^{x}-1)] dx = 0.\n\n- Let a ≡ f/2 + 1. For a diatomic (f=5), a = 5/2 + 1 = 7/2. Then\n  a dT/T + dx/(e^{x} - 1) = 0.\n\n- Integrate:\n  ∫ a dT/T + ∫ dx/(e^{x}-1) = const\n  ⇒ a ln T + ln(1 - e^{-x}) = const\n  ⇒ T^{a} (1 - e^{-x}) = const along the isentrope.\n\n3) Express the invariant in terms of the measurable top pressure p\n- Using the hydrostatic-number relation, we have e^{x} = 1 + (N m g)/(S p), so\n  e^{-x} = S p/(S p + N m g), and\n  1 - e^{-x} = N m g/(S p + N m g).\n\n- Therefore the isentropic invariant becomes\n  T^{a} [N m g/(S p + N m g)] = constant,\n  or equivalently\n  T^{a}/(S p + N m g) = constant.\n\n- Comparing the initial state (T0, p0) and final state (T1, p1):\n  T1^{a}/(S p1 + N m g) = T0^{a}/(S p0 + N m g).\n\n- Solve for T1 with a = 7/2:\n  T1 = T0 [ (S p1 + N m g)/(S p0 + N m g) ]^{1/a}\n      = T0 [ (S p1 + N m g)/(S p0 + N m g) ]^{2/7}.\n\n4) Consistency checks\n- In the limit gravity is negligible compared to applied load, N m g ≪ S p, this reduces to T ∝ p^{(γ-1)/γ} with γ = 7/5 for a diatomic gas: T1/T0 ≈ (p1/p0)^{2/7}.\n- In the opposite limit S p ≪ N m g, the ratio tends to 1, i.e., the temperature barely changes, consistent with the gas weight dominating the stratification.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{T_{1} \\;=\\; T_{0}\\,\\left(\\frac{S\\,p_{1} + N\\,m\\,g}{S\\,p_{0} + N\\,m\\,g}\\right)^{\\!2/7}}\\]"}

Initially, the sphere performs uniform circular motion with a radius R0. Find the time t required when the circular motion radius changes to R. Assume R^2 ≫ A and m0 ≫ ρ A R.\n\nSolution:\n\n1) Relativistic dynamics and angular momentum\n\n- The oscillator moves in an isotropic harmonic potential V = (1/2) k r^2, so the force is central: F = −k r in vector form, magnitude F = k R for a circular orbit of radius R.\n\n- For uniform circular motion at speed v in special relativity, the perpendicular force required is\n  F = γ m v^2 / R,\n  where m is the rest mass of the body at that instant and γ = 1/√(1 − v^2/c^2).\n\n- The torque about the origin due to the spring is zero (central force). The dust being at rest has zero angular momentum about the origin before capture. Considering the body plus newly captured dust and using angular momentum flux arguments, the angular momentum L of the moving body about the origin is conserved despite mass accretion:\n  L = const.\n\nFor a circular orbit at radius R:\n- Force balance: k R = γ m v^2 / R.\n- Angular momentum: L = γ m v R.\n\nCombining the two:\n- Divide force balance by L: (k R)/L = (γ m v^2 / R)/ (γ m v R) = v / R^2,\n  hence\n  v = k R^3 / L.\n- Eliminating v, we get a very convenient invariant form:\n  L^2 = γ m k R^4.\n\nThese two relations hold instantaneously as the orbit shrinks slowly (adiabatic evolution).\n\n2) Mass accretion rate\n\n- The body sweeps volume per unit time A v, so the rest mass growth rate (in the lab frame) is\n  dm/dt = ρ A v.\n\nUsing v = k R^3 / L, this is\n  dm/dt = ρ A (k R^3 / L).\n\n3) Relation between R(t) and m(t)\n\nSince L^2 = γ m k R^4 is constant, differentiate with respect to time:\n  0 = d/dt (γ m k R^4) = k [ m R^4 γ̇ + γ R^4 ṁ + 4 γ m R^3 Ṙ ].\n\nWe need γ̇ in terms of Ṙ. Using v = k R^3 / L, we have\n- dv/dR = 3 k R^2 / L = 3 v / R,\n- dγ/dv = γ^3 v / c^2,\nso\n  γ̇ = (dγ/dv) dv/dt = γ^3 v (3 v Ṙ / R)/c^2 = 3 γ^3 v^2 Ṙ / (c^2 R).\n\nPlugging γ̇, ṁ = ρ A v into the derivative of L^2:\n  0 = k [ m R^4 (3 γ^3 v^2 Ṙ / (c^2 R)) + γ R^4 (ρ A v) + 4 γ m R^3 Ṙ ].\n\nDivide by k R^3 and rearrange:\n  Ṙ [ 3 γ^3 m v^2 / c^2 + 4 γ m ] = − γ ρ A v R.\n\nSolve for Ṙ:\n  Ṙ = − (γ ρ A v R) / [ 4 γ m + 3 γ^3 m v^2 / c^2 ].\n\nUsing the invariant L^2 = γ m k R^4 ⇒ γ m = L^2 / (k R^4), and v = k R^3 / L, we can write this purely in terms of R and constants (L, k):\n  Ṙ = − [ γ ρ A (k R^3 / L) R ] / [ 4 (L^2/(k R^4)) + 3 γ^2 (L^2/(k R^4)) (k^2 R^6 / L^2)/c^2 ].\n\nAfter simplification:\n  dR/dt = − [ γ ρ A k^2 R^8 / L^3 ] / [ 4 + 3 γ^2 k^2 R^6 / (L^2 c^2) ].\n\nEquivalently, the exact differential for the time is\n  dt/dR = − [ 4 L^3 / (γ ρ A k^2 R^8) ] − [ 3 L γ / (ρ A c^2 R^2) ].\n\nThis is exact within the assumptions (adiabatic circular evolution with accretion).\n\n4) Time to shrink from R0 to R: exact integral form\n\nIntegrate from R0 to R (< R0) noting that dR/dt < 0:\n  t = ∫_{R}^{R0} [ 4 L^3 / (γ(R) ρ A k^2 R^8) + 3 L γ(R) / (ρ A c^2 R^2) ] dR,\nwith\n  γ(R) = 1 / sqrt(1 − v(R)^2/c^2),  v(R) = k R^3 / L.\n\nThis integral does not, in general, reduce to elementary functions. However, under the stated conditions (R^2 ≫ A and m0 ≫ ρ A R) the evolution is slow, and typically v/c is small; we can obtain a uniformly accurate first-order relativistic correction.\n\n5) Leading-order (nonrelativistic) result plus first relativistic correction\n\nExpand γ to first order in ε = v^2/c^2:\n- γ ≈ 1 + (1/2) ε,  1/γ ≈ 1 − (1/2) ε,  ε(R) = v(R)^2/c^2 = k^2 R^6/(L^2 c^2).\n\nUsing the exact dt/dR above and keeping terms through O(1/c^2), we find\n  dt/dR ≈ − [ 4 L^3 / (ρ A k^2 R^8) + L / (ρ A c^2 R^2) ].\n\nIntegrating from R0 to R gives\n  t ≈ (4 L^3)/(7 ρ A k^2) [ R^{-7} − R0^{-7} ] + (L)/(ρ A c^2) [ R^{-1} − R0^{-1} ].\n\nFinally, express L in terms of the initial orbit at R0. Exactly, L^2 = γ0 m0 k R0^4 with γ0 the initial Lorentz factor. To the same order (first in 1/c^2), we may use the nonrelativistic value L ≈ √(m0 k) R0^2 (this is sufficient since the second term is already O(1/c^2)). Substituting L ≈ √(m0 k) R0^2 yields the explicit approximate closed form:\n\n- Leading nonrelativistic term:\n  t_NR = (4 m0^{3/2} R0^6)/(7 ρ A √k) [ R^{-7} − R0^{-7} ].\n\n- First relativistic correction:\n  t_rel,1 = (√(m0 k) R0^2)/(ρ A c^2) [ R^{-1} − R0^{-1} ].\n\nThus,\n  t ≈ t_NR + t_rel,1,\nwithin the assumptions R^2 ≫ A and m0 ≫ ρ A R (slow accretion, adiabatic orbit evolution).\n\nNote:\n- If desired, one can keep the exact L using L^2 = γ0 m0 k R0^4 (with γ0 determined from k R0 = γ0 m0 v0^2 / R0) in the compact expression t ≈ (4 L^3)/(7 ρ A k^2) (R^{-7} − R0^{-7}) + (L)/(ρ A c^2) (R^{-1} − R0^{-1}).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,t(R)\\;\\approx\\; \\frac{4\\,m_{0}^{3/2}\\,R_{0}^{6}}{7\\,\\rho\\,A\\,\\sqrt{k}}\\left(R^{-7}-R_{0}^{-7}\\right)\\;+\\;\\frac{\\sqrt{m_{0}\\,k}\\,R_{0}^{2}}{\\rho\\,A\\,c^{2}}\\left(R^{-1}-R_{0}^{-1}\\right)\\,}\n\\]"}

The inner shell is uniformly charged with a total charge of $Q(Q>0)$, while the outer shell is uncharged. There is also a small insulating sphere with a charge of $+q(q>0)$ and a mass $m$, which can be launched from a point on the inner shell with a certain velocity. The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center. If the sphere is launched from point $A$ on the inner shell and it collides with the inner shell a total of $n$ times (counting the final return to the starting point as one collision), determine the minimum launch speed $v$, ignoring gravity.\n", "solutions": "Let the distance from the center of the sphere to the position of the ball at the extreme point be $r_{1}$, and the speed be $ u_{\\mathrm{_I}}$.

The angular displacement around the center during inner and outer sphere collisions is: $$ \\alpha = {\\frac{2\\pi}{2n}} = {\\frac{\\pi}{n}} $$ The curve $AB$ is its trajectory, with point $O$ as one focus of the hyperbola, and $C$ as the other focus. According to conic section knowledge, the trajectory of the hyperbola to focus $O$ is: $$ r = \\frac{p}{e\\cos\\theta^{\\prime}-1} $$ where $\\theta^{\\prime}$ is the angle between the trajectory of the ball and its polar axis.

Between the shells (R < r < 2R), the electric potential energy is U(r) = α/r (repulsive), and the force is central. Because collisions with the spherical shells are perfectly elastic and specular (normal is radial), the tangential component of velocity is unchanged at impact, so both the total mechanical energy E and the angular momentum L about the center are conserved throughout the motion, including across collisions.\n\n- Energy and angular momentum:\n  E = 1/2 m (v_r^2 + v_t^2) + α/R initially,\n  L = m R v_t initially.\n  We can choose the initial direction (thus L for given v), while E depends only on v at r = R.\n\n- The motion between collisions is a Kepler-type trajectory under a repulsive 1/r potential. The orbit in polar coordinates (with the focus at the center) is\n  r(θ) = l / (e cos Θ − 1),\n  where Θ = θ − θ0, l = L^2/(m α), and e ≥ 1 is the eccentricity. The parameters satisfy the standard relation\n  e^2 = 1 + 2 E L^2/(m α^2) = 1 + 2 l E / α.\n\n- The angle swept as r changes from r1 to r2 along this branch follows from\n  e cos Θ(r) = 1 + l/r  ⇒  Θ(r) = arccos[(1 + l/r)/e].\n\n- Between two successive inner-shell collisions, the particle travels from r = R out to r = 2R and back to r = R (one collision at the outer shell in between). Hence the angular advance between inner-shell collisions is\n  Δθ_in = 2 Δθ_leg,  where  Δθ_leg = Θ(2R) − Θ(R).\n\n- To return to the starting point after one full revolution (2π) and having n inner-shell collisions (counting the final return), the total angular advance is n Δθ_in = 2π, so\n  Δθ_leg = π/n.\n\n- For a given speed v, Δθ_leg is maximized by maximizing L (for the same v), since θ̇ = L/(m r^2) increases and the radial motion slows, both increasing the angular sweep. Thus the minimal launch speed for a given n is attained for the launch that is tangential at r = R (v_r → 0+), i.e., L = m R v. In this limit, r = R is the periapsis, so e = 1 + l/R, with l = L^2/(m α) = m R^2 v^2/α.\n\n- With this choice:\n  e = 1 + l/R = 1 + (m R v^2)/α,\n  Θ(R) = arccos[(1 + l/R)/e] = arccos(1) = 0,\n  Θ(2R) = arccos[(1 + l/(2R))/e] = arccos[(1 + x/2)/(1 + x)],\n  where x = l/R = (m R v^2)/α.\n\n- Therefore\n  Δθ_leg = Θ(2R) − Θ(R) = arccos[(1 + x/2)/(1 + x)].\n  The closing condition gives\n  arccos[(1 + x/2)/(1 + x)] = π/n,\n  so\n  cos(π/n) = (1 + x/2)/(1 + x).\n\n- Solving for x:\n  2 cos(π/n) (1 + x) = 1 + x/2\n  ⇒ x (2 cos(π/n) − 1) = 2 (1 − cos(π/n))\n  ⇒ x = [2 (1 − cos(π/n))]/[2 cos(π/n) − 1].\n\n- Converting back to v with x = (m R v^2)/α gives the minimal speed\n  v_min^2 = (α/(m R)) · [2 (1 − cos(π/n))]/[2 cos(π/n) − 1].\n\n- Existence/consistency:\n  The denominator is positive only if cos(π/n) > 1/2, i.e., n > 3.

It is convenient to introduce x = r/R_m = 1 + h/R_m, so that r = R_m x and dr = R_m dx. Then ρ = ρ0 x^{1 - n} and g = G M_m / (R_m^2 x^2). The hydrostatic equation becomes\ndP/dr = -ρ0 x^{1 - n} G M_m / (R_m^2 x^2) = - (ρ0 G M_m / R_m^2) x^{-(n+1)}.\n\nTransforming to x:\ndP/dx = (dP/dr)(dr/dx) = - (ρ0 G M_m / R_m^2) x^{-(n+1)} · R_m = - (ρ0 G M_m / R_m) x^{-(n+1)}.\n\nIntegrate from x to ∞:\nP(∞) - P(x) = ∫_{x}^{∞} dP = - (ρ0 G M_m / R_m) ∫_{x}^{∞} u^{-(n+1)} du.\n\nSince ∫_{x}^{∞} u^{-(n+1)} du = x^{-n}/n (for n > 0), we obtain\n0 - P(x) = - (ρ0 G M_m / R_m) (x^{-n}/n)\n⇒ P(x) = (ρ0 G M_m / (n R_m)) x^{-n}.\n\nThus the pressure profile is\nP(h) = (ρ0 G M_m / (n R_m)) (1 + h/R_m)^{-n}.\n\nNow use the ideal gas law in molar form, P = (ρ/μ) R T, where μ is the molar mass and R is the universal gas constant. Solve for T:\nT(h) = μ P(h) / (R ρ(h)).\n\nCompute the ratio P/ρ using the expressions above:\nP/ρ = [ (ρ0 G M_m / (n R_m)) x^{-n} ] / [ ρ0 x^{1 - n} ] = (G M_m / (n R_m)) x^{-1} = G M_m / (n (R_m + h)).\n\nTherefore,\nT(h) = (μ / R) [ G M_m / (n (R_m + h)) ].\n\nThis temperature profile decreases as 1/(R_m + h) and is independent of ρ0; the condition n > 4 ensures a finite atmospheric mass but is not otherwise needed to obtain T(h).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{\\,T(h) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\mu\\, G M_{m}}{n\\, R\\, (R_{m} + h)}\\,}\\]"}

At that point Iring(z0) = I0 (because the flux constant is L I0 + Φext(z0)), and the equilibrium condition is\n  I0 Φ′ext(z0) = m g.\n  Note: For z0 > 0 one has Φ′ext(z0) < 0. Therefore, stability at z0 requires I0 to have the opposite sign to Φ′ext(z0), i.e., I0 must be negative (opposite to the solenoid current) if z0 > 0. In formulas below we use the equilibrium condition as written; the absolute values can be inserted if one prefers to track magnitudes only.\n\n- Using k = (Φ′0)^2 / L − I0 Φ″0 with Φ′0 ≡ Φ′ext(z0), Φ″0 ≡ Φ″ext(z0), and substituting Φ″0 = (Φ″0/Φ′0) Φ′0 together with Φ″0/Φ′0 = − 3 z0 / (R^2 + z0^2), we get\n  k = (Φ′0)^2 / L − I0 (Φ″0/Φ′0) Φ′0\n    = (Φ′0)^2 / L − (− 3 z0 / (R^2 + z0^2)) I0 Φ′0\n    = (Φ′0)^2 / L + (3 z0 / (R^2 + z0^2)) m g,\n  where in the last step we used I0 Φ′0 = m g.\n\n- Therefore\n  ω^2 = k / m = (Φ′0)^2 / (L m) + 3 z0 g / (R^2 + z0^2).\n\n- Eliminate Φ′0 by the equilibrium condition I0 Φ′0 = m g to get the compact result\n  ω^2 = (m g^2) / (L I0^2) + 3 z0 g / (R^2 + z0^2).\n\n6) Remarks\n- The small-oscillation frequency depends on gravity (as it must, because gravity selects the equilibrium height and contributes to the curvature via the equilibrium condition) and on L, I0, m, R, and z0. Remarkably, it is independent of n and r after using the equilibrium condition, despite the fact that Φext and its derivatives depend on n and r; those dependencies cancel out in ω through the equilibrium relation I0 Φ′0 = m g.\n- The result holds for r ≪ R and for small oscillations around the equilibrium position z0 > 0.\n- Stability requires ω^2 > 0, which is satisfied here because both terms are positive for z0 > 0.\n\nFinal expression for the period:\nT = 2π / sqrt[ (m g^2)/(L I0^2) + 3 z0 g/(R^2 + z0^2) ].\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{\\,T \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\;\\dfrac{m g^{2}}{L\\, I_{0}^{2}} \\;+\\; \\dfrac{3 z_{0}\\, g}{R^{2}+z_{0}^{2}}\\,}}\\,}\\]"}

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession. Solve for its precession angular frequency $\\Omega$ (the answer can be expressed in terms of $q_{0}$ and $r_{0}$).", "solutions": "According to the problem statement, a single ideal gas under the isothermal model can satisfy the Boltzmann distribution in any continuous potential energy field distribution.

Interactions are neglected; the equilibrium spatial distribution of each species is governed only by the centrifugal potential (we are told to ignore the effect of the internal electrostatic potential on the distributions, i.e., use k = ω^2/(2 kB T0)). This produces a net space charge and a radial electric field Er(r) within the cylinder. A UAV of mass m and (small) volume V is inserted; it can only provide vertical thrust, and in its steady operation it co-rotates at some radius r0 with the same ω and then is given a small radial “kick,” after which it precesses. We are asked to find its precession angular frequency Ω, and it is stated that the answer can be expressed in terms of q0 and r0. In what follows I denote by q0 the UAV’s net electric charge (this is the only way the UAV can feel the typhoon’s electric field while providing no horizontal thrust).\n\n1) Radial charge separation and Er(r) in the rotating, isothermal cylinder\n- In the rotating frame at temperature T0 and ignoring the electrostatic potential in the Boltzmann factors (as instructed), the number density of each species s ∈ {i, e} is\n  ns(r) = n s0 exp(ms k r^2), with k ≡ ω^2/(2 kB T0).\n- The total number of ions and electrons (we assume one free electron per ion; strong ionization) within the cylinder of height H and radius R gives\n  Ns = ∫V ns dV = 2πH ∫0^R ns0 e^{ms k r^2} r dr\n     = πH ns0 [e^{ms k R^2} − 1]/(ms k),\n  hence\n  ns0 = Ns ms k/[πH (e^{ms k R^2} − 1)].\n- The net charge density is\n  ρ(r) = e[ni(r) − ne(r)] \n       = e k N/(πH) [ mi e^{mi k r^2}/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − me e^{me k r^2}/(e^{me k R^2} − 1) ],\n  where I used Ni = Ne = N.\n- Gauss’s law in cylindrical symmetry (H ≫ R so edge effects are negligible) gives\n  (1/r) d/dr [ r Er(r) ] = ρ(r)/ε0,\n  with regularity at r = 0 implying Er(0) = 0. Integrating once,\n  Er(r) = (1/(ε0 r)) ∫0^r ρ(ξ) ξ dξ\n        = eN/(2π ε0 H r) [ (e^{mi k r^2} − 1)/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − (e^{me k r^2} − 1)/(e^{me k R^2} − 1) ].\n  It will also be useful that\n  Er′(r) = dEr/dr = ρ(r)/ε0 − Er(r)/r\n         = eN/(2π ε0 H) [ −Δf(r)/r^2 + 2k ( mi e^{mi k r^2}/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − me e^{me k r^2}/(e^{me k R^2} − 1) ) ],\n  where Δf(r) ≡ (e^{mi k r^2} − 1)/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − (e^{me k r^2} − 1)/(e^{me k R^2} − 1).\n\n2) Steady co-rotation condition for the UAV at r0\n- Work in the frame rotating at ω. There the unperturbed UAV is stationary at r = r0, θ = const. The only horizontal forces we retain (consistent with the problem’s statement that the UAV provides no horizontal thrust and with the modeling emphasis on the electric field) are the electrostatic force q0 Er(r) r̂ and the fictitious centrifugal force m ω^2 r r̂. The equilibrium at r0 requires\n  q0 Er(r0) + m ω^2 r0 = 0\n  (the electric force must balance the outward centrifugal force). This fixes a relation among q0, r0, and the ambient field Er(r0).\n\n3) Small in-plane perturbations and linearized equations of motion; precession frequency\n- Let the in-plane displacement from r0 be ξ = (x, y), with x along the local radial direction and y along the local azimuthal direction at r0. In the rotating frame (constant ω), the linearized in-plane equations are\n  m ξ̈ = q0 [ Er(r0) + (∂Er/∂r)|0 x ] r̂0 − 2 m ω ẑ × ξ̇ + m ω^2 ξ,\n  where I expanded the electric field to first order (including its change in magnitude and direction). Using the standard identity for the gradient of a central field Er(r) r̂, the linearized system becomes\n  m ẍ − 2 m ω ẏ + [ m ω^2 + q0 Er′(r0) ] x = 0,\n  m ÿ + 2 m ω ẋ + [ m ω^2 + q0 Er(r0)/r0 ] y = 0.\n- Use the equilibrium condition q0 Er(r0)/r0 = − m ω^2. Then the azimuthal Hooke-like term vanishes, and we obtain\n  m ẍ − 2 m ω ẏ + [ m ω^2 + q0 Er′(r0) ] x = 0,\n  m ÿ + 2 m ω ẋ = 0.\n- Seeking normal modes x, y ∝ e^{i Ω t} yields the dispersion relation\n  [ −Ω^2 + ω^2 + (q0/m) Er′(r0) ] (−Ω^2) − (−2 i ω Ω)(2 i ω Ω) = 0,\n  i.e.\n  Ω^4 − Ω^2 [ 5 ω^2 + (q0/m) Er′(r0) ] = 0.\n- One root is Ω = 0 (the neutral shift of the guiding center). The nontrivial oscillatory mode has\n  Ω^2 = 5 ω^2 + (q0/m) Er′(r0).\n\n4) Expressing Er′(r0) and useful limiting form\n- A compact and exact identity that is independent of the detailed form of ρ(r) is\n  Er′(r0) = ρ(r0)/ε0 − Er(r0)/r0.\n  Using the equilibrium relation q0 Er(r0)/r0 = − m ω^2, this can also be written as\n  Ω^2 = 6 ω^2 + (q0/m) ρ(r0)/ε0.\n- If, in the neighborhood of r0, Er(r) is approximately linear in r (equivalently, the enclosed net charge Qenc(r) ∝ r^2 locally; this indeed happens near the axis in the present model when R is not too small), then Er′(r0) ≈ Er(r0)/r0, so (q0/m) Er′(r0) ≈ −ω^2 and the precession frequency reduces to the elegant, parameter-free result\n  Ω = 2 ω.\n  For those who want it explicitly “in terms of q0 and r0,” note that, by cylindrical Gauss’s law, Er(r0) = Qenc(r0)/(2π ε0 H r0), hence the equilibrium gives ω^2 = − q0 Qenc(r0)/(2π ε0 m H r0^2), and the above becomes\n  Ω = 2 √[ − q0 Qenc(r0)/(2π ε0 m H r0^2) ].\n  But the exact general expression remains Ω^2 = 5 ω^2 + (q0/m) Er′(r0).\n\nSummary of what to plug from the kinetic model (if desired):\n- k = ω^2/(2 kB T0).\n- Er(r) = eN/(2π ε0 H r) [ (e^{mi k r^2} − 1)/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − (e^{me k r^2} − 1)/(e^{me k R^2} − 1) ].\n- Er′(r) = eN/(2π ε0 H) [ −Δf(r)/r^2 + 2k ( mi e^{mi k r^2}/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − me e^{me k r^2}/(e^{me k R^2} − 1) ) ].\nEvaluating these at r = r0 and inserting into Ω^2 = 5 ω^2 + (q0/m) Er′(r0) gives a closed expression in terms of q0, r0, and known typhoon parameters (N, R, H, T0, mi, me, ε0).\n\nFinal physical interpretation:\n- The term 4 ω^2 comes from the Coriolis coupling (the familiar inertial oscillation at 2 ω), while the extra +ω^2 in the 5 ω^2 arises from the curvature of the effective potential in the rotating frame. The electrostatic radial stiffness contributes (q0/m) Er′(r0). In the common linear-field regime, these combine to give Ω = 2 ω.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{\\Omega \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\,5\\,\\omega^{2} \\;+\\; \\frac{q_{0}}{m}\\,E_r^{\\,\\prime}(r_{0})\\,}\\,,\n\\quad\\text{with}\\;\\;E_r^{\\,\\prime}(r_{0}) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\rho(r_{0})}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\;-\\; \\frac{E_r(r_{0})}{r_{0}}\\,,\n\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;q_{0}E_r(r_{0}) + m\\omega^{2}r_{0}=0.}\\]"}
