{"id": "OPTICS/495", "questions": "In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate.

Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

The correct general relations at impact, given v0 = ω0 r, are I = [(1+β)/2] m v0 and I_N = [(1−β)/2] m v0. For a thin disk (β = 1/4), these reduce to I = (5/8) m v0 and I_N = (3/8) m v0, as used earlier.\n\nAssessment of physics and mathematics\n- Energy during contact for a thin disk (moment of inertia about a body-fixed horizontal diameter J = (1/4) m r^2) is T = (1/2) m r^2 (cos^2φ + 1/4) φ̇^2, and U = m g r sinφ. This is correct.\n- The normal reaction obtained from dynamics (or Lagrange multipliers), N = (m/4)[g − r sinφ φ̇^2]/(cos^2φ + 1/4), is correct. Setting N = 0 yields the universal lift-off condition φ̇^2 = g/(r sinφ).\n- Combining energy with the lift-off condition gives v0^2/(gr) = 1/sinφ + (4/5) sinφ, which is strictly decreasing on sinφ ∈ (0, 1], so the minimum occurs at φ = 90°. This yields v0,min = (3√5/5) √(gr).\n\nMost accurate solution (thin disk)\n- Impact stage (immediately after the vertical impulse at the overhanging rim):\n  - Minimal normal-impulse non-penetration at the most downward-moving rim point enforces v0 = ω0 r.\n  - With J = (1/4) m r^2, the linear and angular impulse balances give I + I_N = m v0 and r(I − I_N) = J ω0 = (1/4) m r v0, hence I = (5/8) m v0 and I_N = (3/8) m v0. The initial mechanical energy is E0 = (1/2) m v0^2 + (1/2) J ω0^2 = (5/8) m v0^2.\n- During rocking while in contact:\n  - Geometry: y_c = r sinφ.\n  - Energies: T = (1/2) m r^2 (cos^2φ + 1/4) φ̇^2, U = m g r sinφ.\n  - Normal reaction: N = (m/4)[g − r sinφ φ̇^2]/(cos^2φ + 1/4).\n- Lift-off condition:\n  - N = 0 ⇒ φ̇^2 = g/(r sinφ).\n- Threshold and minimization:\n  - Conservation of energy from t = 0+ to lift-off gives\n    (5/8) m v0^2 = (1/2) m r^2 (cos^2φ + 1/4) φ̇^2 + m g r sinφ.\n  - Using φ̇^2 = g/(r sinφ) at lift-off yields\n    v0^2/(g r) = 1/sinφ + (4/5) sinφ.\n  - This is strictly decreasing on sinφ ∈ (0, 1], so the minimum is at sinφ = 1 (φ = 90°):\n    v0,min^2/(g r) = 9/5 ⇒ v0,min = (3√5/5) √(g r).\n\nFinal verdict\n- The reference answer’s physics and final result are correct. The streamlined derivation above is the most transparent, and the key quantitative outcome is v0,min = (3√5/5) √(g r). The only correction needed from the debate is the general (β) impulse formulas at impact; the thin-disk case used here is consistent throughout.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ v_{0,\\min} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\,\\sqrt{g r} } \\]"}

The point dipole at the center is handled by matching the 1/r^2 term to the known vacuum dipole potential, ensuring B1 = m/(4π R^2).\n- The boundary conditions applied (continuity of tangential H and normal B) are correctly translated into relations among the coefficients A_i, B_i. The far-field condition A3 = −B0 R/μ0 is consistent with B0 being the uniform flux density in vacuum at infinity; the cavity and exterior are vacuum (μ0), and only the shell has μ = 3 μ0.\n- The key physical point for the torque is the use of the energy cross-term: in a linear medium the orientation-dependent energy is U_cross(α) = −m·B_ext,eff, where B_ext,eff is the field at the dipole due to the external uniform source after screening by the shell. Any terms quadratic in m (reaction of the shell to the dipole) are independent of α and produce no torque. This makes the torque τ = −∂U/∂α = −s m B0 sin α, with s = B_in/B0 obtained from the shell-only problem (m = 0).

Eliminating ψ̈ does not affect the δ–α relation.\n- Kinetic energy accounting: The along-torso-axis translational KE produces both the δ̇^2 coefficient a_trans and the α̇δ̇ cross coefficient b. Crucially, the legs’ perpendicular COM motion contributes an additional δ̇^2 term, and the rotational KE of both legs about their COMs contributes I_total δ̇^2/2, which means a_rot = I_total in the equation T = (1/2) a δ̇^2 + b α̇δ̇ + … The final numbers below reflect all of these.\n\nConcise, corrected derivation (CM frame, linearized)\n- Masses and lengths:\n  - Arms: two rods, each length l, mass λ l ⇒ total mass m_A = 2 λ l.\n  - Legs: two rods, each length 1.2l, mass 1.2λ l ⇒ total mass m_L = 2.4 λ l.\n  - Torso: rod, length l, mass λ l; head: point mass 0.6 λ l ⇒ m_0 = 1.6 λ l.\n  - Total mass M = 6 λ l.\n\n- Small-angle kinematics along the torso axis e_t:\n  - Arm pair COM: s_A = l − (l/2) α ⇒ ṡ_A = − (l/2) α̇.\n  - Leg COM (each): s_L = 0.6 l cos(π/4 + δ) ≈ (0.6/√2) l (1 − δ) ⇒ ṡ_L = − (0.6/√2) l δ̇.\n  - CM velocity along e_t: ṡ_CM = [m_A ṡ_A + m_L ṡ_L]/M = − (l/6) α̇ − (6/(25√2)) l δ̇.\n\n  Velocities along e_t relative to CM:\n  - Arms pair: v_tA = ṡ_A − ṡ_CM = − (l/3) α̇ + (6/(25√2)) l δ̇.\n  - Legs pair: v_tL = ṡ_L − ṡ_CM = (l/6) α̇ − (9/(25√2)) l δ̇.\n  - Torso+head: v_t0 = − ṡ_CM = (l/6) α̇ + (6/(25√2)) l δ̇.\n\n- Kinetic energy terms that affect the δ-equation:\n  1) Along-axis translational KE:\n     T_trans,∥ = (1/2)[m_A v_tA^2 + m_L v_tL^2 + m_0 v_t0^2]\n     ⇒ contributes a_trans = (3/5) λ l^3 [3 c^2 + 2 d^2] = 81/625 λ l^3,\n     and b = (2/5) λ l^3 (d − c) = − 6/(25√2) λ l^3,\n     where c = 6/(25√2), d = − 9/(25√2).\n  2) Perpendicular translational KE of the legs’ COMs:\n     Each leg has v_⊥ = 0.6 l cos(π/4) δ̇ ≈ (0.6/√2) l δ̇; energies add for two legs:\n     ΔT_perp = (1/2)·2·(1.2 λ l)·[(0.6/√2) l δ̇]^2 = (27/125) λ l^3 δ̇^2,\n     ⇒ a_perp = 27/125 λ l^3.\n  3) Rotational KE of both legs about their COMs:\n     I_total = 2 · (1/12)(1.2 λ l)(1.2 l)^2 = 36/125 λ l^3,\n     ⇒ T_rot = (1/2) I_total δ̇^2, so a_rot = I_total = 36/125 λ l^3.\n\n  Summing: a = a_trans + a_perp + a_rot = (81/625 + 27/125 + 36/125) λ l^3 = 396/625 λ l^3.\n\n- Equation for δ with α prescribed:\n  From T = (1/2) a δ̇^2 + b α̇ δ̇ + … we get a δ̈ + b α̈ = 0.\n  For α(t) = θ0 cos ω t, the steady response is δ(t) = K α(t) with\n  K = − b/a = [6/(25√2)] / [396/625] = 25/(66√2) ≈ 0.268.\n\nDetermination of the most accurate solution\n- The corrected constant K = 25/(66√2) arises from a complete and internally consistent CM-frame linearization that includes all first-order kinetic-energy contributions, including the legs’ perpendicular COM motion and the full two-leg rotational inertia.

Writing X = √(m g L) θ and Y = √(1/2 m g R) φ gives E0 = X^2 + Y^2 and\n  τ_support = √(m g R) [ (4/π) √(R/L) X − √2 (2/π) Y ].\n  By Cauchy–Schwarz, the maximum transmitted torque is\n  |τ_support| ≤ √(m g R) (2/π) √(4 R/L + 2) √(E0),\n  with equality attainable for Y/X = √(L/(2R)) and opposite signs of φ and θ.\n\n- Conclusion vs. reference answer: The reference solution’s structure is correct, but its torque coefficients were derived with an incorrect centroid placement, leading to a smaller prefactor. The corrected, internally consistent result is the one both debaters converged to.\n\nFinal verdict\n- The defender’s corrected derivation (acknowledged by the challenger) is the most accurate. The maximum ceiling separation permitting zero tension in one string at some instant is:\n  d_max = (2/π) √(E0 R/(m g)) √(4 R/L + 2).\n- This result is tight, consistent with the equations of motion and geometry, and passes multiple limiting checks, including the L → ∞ limit and the special cases φ = 0 and θ = 0.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ d_{\\max} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{E_{0}\\,R}{m g}}\\,\\sqrt{\\,\\frac{4 R}{L} + 2\\,} } \\]"}

The torque on the spherical shell about the axis gives a clean expression for the friction magnitude f(φ), and a moment balance about the hinge (including the ω × H term due to the rod’s tilted inertia) yields a unique normal force N(φ) without any variational step.\n- Both parties verified consistency: correct dimensions, sensible limits (m → 0, M → 0, small φ), the lift-off condition N ≥ 0, and the monotonicity of μ(φ) up to lift-off. The geometric identity R sinγ = L sinβ ≡ ρ and the simplification sin(β+γ) = (d/R) sinβ were used effectively to streamline the expressions.\n\nAssessment of physics and mathematics\n- Dynamics: The system has a single degree of freedom φ(t) (rotation about the horizontal axis). The combined torque balance about the axis gives φ̈ and, via an energy integral, φ̇^2. These are consistent for a freely rotating assembly with no slip.\n- Friction: With friction constrained along eφ, the shell’s equation (2/3) M R^2 φ̈ = (R sinγ) f determines f(φ) unambiguously. The rod’s hinge-moment balance (accounting for ω × H because H is not parallel to ω when the rod is tilted by β) determines N(φ).\n- Static friction coefficient: μ(φ) = |f|/N at impending slip, with no minimization. The resulting μ(φ) is monotone increasing up to lift-off; hence the interpretation “first slip at φ” is self-consistent if contact persists.\n\nDetermination of the most accurate solution\n- The corrected solution (friction along eφ, explicit f and N, no minimization, and inclusion of lift-off condition) is physically and mathematically sound and improves upon the reference answer. The optional elimination of γ via sin(β+γ) = (d/R) sinβ produces a compact final μ(φ) in terms of (L, d, R, M, m, φ) and β.\n\nFinal verdict\n- The defender’s corrected and simplified formulation is the most accurate.

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution.

Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity.

This removes the need for linearized ODEs and hyperbolic functions used in the reference.\n- The resulting recurrence for ω_n is ω_{n+1}^2 = ((1 + e)^2/4)[ω_n^2 + (3g/h)(1 − cos θ0)], with a fixed point ω_∞^2 = ((1 + e)^2/(3 − 2e − e^2))(3g/h)(1 − cos θ0).

The limiting value agrees with physical expectations and shows divergence as e → 1− (no steady state for perfectly elastic impacts), which is a useful consistency check.\n\nDetermination of the most accurate solution\n- The most accurate within-model answer for e = 0 is the exact expression ω_∞ = √[(g/h)(1 − √(1 − (l/h)^2))], with the small-spacing approximation ω_∞ ≈ (l/h) √(g/(2h)) for l ≪ h.\n- This improves on the reference by avoiding unnecessary linearization and by maintaining exact geometry throughout.\n\nFinal verdict\n- The Challenger’s and Defender’s refined derivation is correct and superior in clarity and generality.

The electrostatic force on an insulating, uniformly charged sphere of radius R centered at height h ≥ R above a grounded plane is Fe = −Q^2/(16 π ε0 h^2), which is exact. The magnetic dipole moment of a uniformly charged, rigid solid sphere spinning at angular speed ω about z is m_dip = (Q ω R^2)/5. The Meissner mirror for a dipole normal to the plane produces a repulsive force Fm = 3 μ0 m_dip^2/(32 π h^4) = 3 μ0 Q^2 R^4 ω^2/(800 π h^4).

For any nonrelativistic rotor (ω R ≪ c) and any admissible geometry (h ≥ R), this ratio is ≪ 1. Therefore, the magnetic repulsion cannot cancel the electrostatic attraction, let alone support the weight.

The drift velocity of this guiding center due to the electric field can be expressed using $\\pmb{E},\\pmb{B}$ and their magnitudes.\n\nProblem: We discuss the case where the magnetic field is uniform, but the electric field is non-uniform.

Approximate to the lowest order that can distinguish from the uniform electric field case.", "solutions": "This problem has been modified; the original problem had four questions.\n\nIf there is an electric field present, we find that the motion of the particle will be a combination of two movements: the normal circular Larmor gyration and a drift towards the center of guidance. We can choose the $\\pmb{x}$ axis along the direction of $\\pmb{E}$, so $\\pmb{E}_{y}=0$, and the velocity components related to transverse components can be treated separately. The equation of motion is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d v}{d t}}=q({\\pmb{E}}+v\\times{\\pmb{B}})\n$$  \n\nIts $\\pmb{z}$ component is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{z}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{z}\n$$  \n\nIntegrating yields  \n\n$$\nv_{\\tau}=\\frac{q E_{z}}{m}t+v_{z0}\n$$  \n\nThis is a simple motion along the direction of $\\pmb{B}$.

Differentiating these two equations gives  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{x}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})\n$$  \n\nWe can rewrite the above equations as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})=-\\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})\n$$  \n\nTherefore, if we use $\\begin{array}{r}{v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B}}\\end{array}$ instead of ${\\pmb v_{\\pmb y}}$, the equation simplifies to the situation when the electric field is zero. Thus, the two equations can be replaced by  \n\n$$\nv_{x}=v_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{\\mathrm{e}}t+\\delta)}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\upsilon_{y}=-i\\upsilon_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the angle between the component of the particle's initial velocity in the $_{xy}$ plane ${\\pmb v}_{\\bot}$ and the $\\pmb{x}$ axis (counter-clockwise direction).

Since we already know that the term $\\textstyle m{\\frac{d v}{d t}}$ only gives rise to circular motion with frequency $\\omega_{c}$, this term can be ignored in equation (1). Thus, equation (1) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{{ E}}+\\pmb{{\\upsilon}}\\times\\pmb{{ B}}=0\n$$  \n\nBy taking the cross product of $\\pmb{B}$ with the above expression, we get  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{E}\\times\\pmb{B}=\\pmb{B}\\times(\\pmb{v}\\times\\pmb{B})=\\pmb{v}\\pmb{B}^{2}-\\pmb{B}(\\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{B})\n$$  \n\nThe transverse component of this equation is  \n\n$$\nv_{\\perp q c}=E\\times B/B^{2}\\equiv v_{E}\n$$  \n\nWe define this transverse component as $\\pmb{v}_{E}$, which is the electric field drift towards the center of guidance.\n\nThe equation of motion for the particle is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d{\\boldsymbol{v}}}{d t}}=q[{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{y}})+{\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times{\\boldsymbol{B}}]\n$$  \n\nDecomposing into scalar form, we have  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{x}=\\frac{q B}{m}v_{y}+\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}(y)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{y}=-\\frac{q B}{m}v_{x}\n$$  \n\nSimplifying yields  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{\\upsilon}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\upsilon_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\frac{\\dot{E}_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\pmb{E_{x}}(\\pmb{y})$ is the electric field at the particle's location. To compute this value, we need to know the particle's trajectory, which is precisely what we attempt to solve initially. If the electric field is weak, as a first approximation, we can estimate $E_{x}(y)$ using the undisturbed trajectory.\n\nThe trajectory in the absence of an electric field is given by  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{r_{L}=\\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{|q|B}}\\end{array}$ is the Larmor gyration radius, and we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)\n$$  \n\nWe seek a solution that is the sum of the gyration at $\\omega_{c}$ and a stationary drift $_{v_{E}}$. Since we are interested in expressing $v_{E}$, we can average over one cycle to eliminate the gyration motion. Thus, the equation yields  \n\n$$\n\\bar{v}_{x}=0\n$$  \n\nIn the above equation, the average of the oscillating term $\\ddot{v}_{y}$ is clearly zero, giving us  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\ddot{v}}}_{y}=0=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\overline{{v}}_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\overline{{\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)}}\n$$  \n\nUpon expanding the small approximation and averaging, we find  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{v}}_{y}=-\\frac{E_{x}(y_{0})}{B}(1-\\frac{1}{4}k^{2}r_{L}^{2})\n$$  \n\nThus, due to non-uniformity, the usual $\\pmb{{E}}\\times\\pmb{{B}}$ drift is modified to  \n\n$$\n\\boxed{v_{E}={\\frac{E\\times B}{B^{2}}}(1-{\\frac{1}{4}}{(k \\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{\\vert{q}\\vert B})}^2)}\n$$  \n\nThe correction term represents the finite Larmor radius effect under the sinusoidal electric field distribution.", "final_answers": "$$\nv_E = \\frac{E \\times B}{B^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left(k \\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q| B}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$", "improved_solutions": "Evaluation of the arguments\n- Both Challenger and Defender converge to a consistent guiding-center treatment based on gyroaveraging the Lorentz force in uniform B and static, nonuniform E.

For the sinusoidal Ex(y), ⟨Ex⟩ = E0 cos(kY) J0(k rL) is correct.\n- The resulting drift v_gc = (⟨E⊥⟩ × B)/B^2 gives v_gc = −(E0/B) cos(kY) J0(k rL) ŷ for B = B ẑ, with no x-drift at this order.

This is the right toolkit for a smooth rod (no along-rod reaction), equal masses m, and a massless, inextensible string.\n- The sign conventions in the inward (toward A) direction are clarified: define e_in as the unit vector along the string from B to A, e_in = (−cosθ, +sinθ). Then a_A · e_in = −a_A cosθ and the relative centripetal term contributes +v′2/l inward. This avoids common sign errors.\n- The reference solution’s detour via an auxiliary angle α and its ambiguous substitution steps are unnecessary and potentially confusing. The streamlined derivation is both shorter and clearer.\n\nAssessment of physics and mathematics\n- Horizontal momentum conservation is valid: gravity is vertical, the rod exerts no force along its axis, and the string tension is internal. This yields 2 v_A − v′ sinθ = 0.\n- Energy conservation is applied correctly with the reference level at release; the ball drops by l sinθ, so total KE equals m g l sinθ. The velocity composition v_B = v_A i + v′ u_t with u_t = (−sinθ, −cosθ) correctly gives v_Bx = v_A − v′ sinθ, v_By = −v′ cosθ, and leads to v′2 = 4 g l sinθ/(1 + cos^2θ).\n- The inward force balance for the ball, T − m g sinθ = m(−a_A cosθ + v′2/l), together with the ring’s along-rod equation T cosθ = m a_A, yields T(1 + cos^2θ) = m v′2/l + m g sinθ and the final tension after substitution. Special-case checks at θ → 0+, θ = π/2, and θ → π confirm consistency.\n\nDetermination of the most accurate solution\n- The streamlined derivation presented by both debaters is correct, minimal, and free of the reference’s detours. It produces the tension\n  T(θ) = m g sinθ (5 + cos^2θ)/(1 + cos^2θ)^2,\n  which passes all consistency checks and respects the constraints (the string remains taut for 0 < θ < π).\n\nFinal verdict and solution\n- Verdict: The Challenger/Defender streamlined approach is the most accurate and scientifically sound. The reference’s final expression for T matches, but its intermediate steps contain avoidable ambiguities; the corrected, minimal derivation below is preferred.\n\nCompact final solution\n- Define θ as the angle between the string and the horizontal rod (measured downward). Let v_A be the ring’s speed along the rod, and v′ = l θ̇ be the ball’s speed relative to the ring along the string. Let u_t = (−sinθ, −cosθ) be the unit vector tangent to the string pointing in the direction of the ball’s motion.\n- Horizontal momentum conservation (no along-rod external force):\n  2 v_A − v′ sinθ = 0 ⇒ v_A = (v′ sinθ)/2.\n- Energy (ball descends by l sinθ; take release as zero potential):\n  v_Bx = v_A − v′ sinθ, v_By = −v′ cosθ,\n  so v_B^2 = (v_A − v′ sinθ)^2 + (v′ cosθ)^2 = v_A^2 − 2 v_A v′ sinθ + v′2.\n  Hence total KE: ½ m (v_A^2 + v_B^2) = ½ m [2 v_A^2 − 2 v_A v′ sinθ + v′2]\n  = ¼ m v′2 (1 + cos^2θ) using 2 v_A = v′ sinθ.\n  Set equal to m g l sinθ to get v′2 = 4 g l sinθ/(1 + cos^2θ).\n- Dynamics for T:\n  • Ring along rod: T cosθ = m a_A.\n  • Ball inward (e_in = (−cosθ, +sinθ)): T − m g sinθ = m(−a_A cosθ + v′2/l).\n  Eliminate a_A using a_A = (T cosθ)/m:\n  T(1 + cos^2θ) = m v′2/l + m g sinθ.\n  Substitute v′2 to obtain\n  T(θ) = m g sinθ (5 + cos^2θ)/(1 + cos^2θ)^2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{T(\\theta) = \\frac{m g \\,\\sin\\theta \\,\\big(5 + \\cos^2\\theta\\big)}{\\big(1 + \\cos^2\\theta\\big)^2}} \\]"}
{"id": "MECHANICS/716", "questions": "The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q. A lightweight, smooth-walled insulating thin tube can rotate around a vertical axis through point O in the horizontal plane. At a distance L from point O inside the tube, there is a photoelectric trigger control switch A. A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined. If the distance OB is measured to be $L/2$, determine the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube when the ball is at point B.

This matches the reference result.\n- Threshold: At the top point (x, y, z_rel) = (0, 0, R), the equality gives ω1 = √(g/R), confirming the topmost threshold.\n- Domain: For ω > ω1, the projected boundary exists for |x| ≥ √(R^2 − g^2/ω^4), and as ω → ∞ the non-ejectable set shrinks to the poles (±R, 0). The non-ejectable region on the top hemisphere is defined by the non-strict inequality g cosφ ≥ ω^2 R sinθ (equivalently y^2 ≤ … inside x^2 + y^2 ≤ R^2).\n\nDetermination of the most accurate solution\n- The consolidated solution (defender) with the challenger’s corrections is accurate and complete. It reproduces the reference boundary curve, correctly interprets ω1, clarifies the geometry and domain, and emphasizes independence from H.\n\nFinal verdict\n- The correct projected boundary of the non-ejectable region on the xy-plane is y^2 = (ω^4/g^2)(R^2 − x^2)(x^2 − R^2 + g^2/ω^4), and the topmost detachment threshold is ω1 = √(g/R).

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

The sphere is placed on the ground so that the circular surface formed by one of the wires is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. It is known that the sphere's center has acquired a velocity \\( v_0 \\) in the horizontal plane, and its initial angular velocity is such that it is in a pure rolling state. What is the subsequent change in velocity?", "solutions": "By noticing that the cutting of the magnetic field by the wire induces an electromotive force, which in turn generates Ampere force and torque, the motion state of the sphere changes. Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical. This results in no current through the cross-shaped wires in the center.   \n\nOnly the circular arcs perpendicular to the ${\\pmb x}$ direction have current, with the electromotive force given by:\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-\\pi R^{2}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nThus, the current is:\n\n$$\nI={\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2\\pi R\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nThe $\\pmb{\\mathscr{x}}$ component of the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{x}=I S=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{\\vec{B}}\n$$  \n\nIn the rest frame, the magnetic field rotates at an angular velocity of $-\\alpha$ (referring to the angular velocity of the sphere's rotation).

The dynamics are thus set by static friction (to maintain rolling), the Ampère torque, and the rolling constraint.\n\n- The key technical point is the sign of the motional EMF and, consequently, the sign of the induced magnetic moment μ. The correct relation for a rigid loop moving in a static, uniform magnetic field is ε_mot = ∮(v × B)·dℓ = − dΦ/dt. With Φ = S B·n and ṅ = ω × n, this gives ε_i = S (ω × B)·n_i for each great-circle loop i. This leads to a positive coefficient in μ = K (ω × B), with K = S^2/R_loop = π R^3/(2λ). This fixes the remaining inconsistency: with μ = +K ω × B, the magnetic torque is τ = μ × B = −K B^2 ω for ω ⟂ B, ensuring dissipation (τ·ω ≤ 0) and matching Joule heating.\n\n- The superposition over the three orthogonal great circles is justified by linearity and octahedral symmetry: the effective loop-response matrix is diagonal in the basis of the three loop normals, so interconnections do not induce cross-couplings between orthogonal loops. One may equivalently view this as a symmetry-based diagonalization of the mesh-current response. The resulting μ is μ = K (ω × B).\n\n- With these in place, the dynamics are straightforward: m dv/dt = f, I dω/dt = R n × f + τ_mag with I = (2/5) m R^2, and v = R n × ω.

Projecting the surface potential per unit mass onto P2(cos θ) yields:\n  - Self-gravity anisotropy (resists bulging): v_g,2 = −(8π/45) G ρ R^2 e^2 P2.\n  - Centrifugal potential (drives bulging): v_rot,2 = +(1/3) ω^2 R^2 P2.\n  - Ring tide (drives bulging): v_ring,2 = +(G m R^2/(2 r^3)) P2.\n- Equipotential condition: The coefficient of P2 must vanish:\n  −(8π/45) G ρ R^2 e^2 + (1/3) ω^2 R^2 + (G m R^2/(2 r^3)) = 0.\n  Solving gives\n  e^2 = (30 ω^2 + 45 G m/r^3)/(16 π G ρ),\n  valid to leading order in the small parameters ω^2/(Gρ) and (G m/r^3)/(Gρ).\n- Equivalent Love-number cross-check: For an incompressible homogeneous body, h2 = 5/2 and g = 4πGρR/3. The degree-2 forcing at the surface is U2 = [(1/3) ω^2 R^2 + (G m R^2/(2 r^3))] P2. The small-e shape has δr/R = −(e^2/3) P2. Hydrostatic theory gives δr/R = h2 U2/(g R). Equating yields the same e^2 as above.\n- Notes and limits:\n  - Relation to flattening: f = (a − b)/a ≈ e^2/2 for small e.\n  - Accuracy: The leading-order result is unaffected by dropping e^4 terms from rotation and tide; their impact on e^2 is higher order by O(ω^2/(Gρ)) and O((G m/r^3)/(Gρ)).\n  - Numerics for Earth-like values (ρ ≈ 5.5×10^3 kg/m^3, ω ≈ 7.29×10^−5 s^−1) give e ≈ 0.093 and f ≈ 0.0043, larger than Earth’s actual flattening because a homogeneous incompressible fluid is more deformable than the real, centrally condensed, partly elastic Earth.\n\nVerdict\n- The Defender’s final expression, with the clarified assumptions, corrected coefficients, and consistent truncation, is physically and mathematically correct at leading order. It is consistent with classical Maclaurin and Love-number results and is the most accurate answer to the stated problem under the given model.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ e \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{30\\,\\omega^{2} \\;+\\; 45\\,G\\,m/r^{3}}{16\\,\\pi\\,G\\,\\rho}} } \\]"}

The balance condition Δp/ΔV = γ p0/V0 is physically and mathematically consistent.\n- Final result: Substitution gives Q_in,min = [2√(γ p0 V0 W) − W]/(γ − 1), hence η_max = (γ − 1)/(2√(γ p0 V0/W) − 1). Domain constraints p_low = p0 − Δp* ≥ 0 and V_low = V0 − ΔV* ≥ 0 are satisfied under the stated “W sufficiently small” assumption; if violated, the optimum becomes boundary-limited with a different, piecewise form.\n- Consistency and scaling: η_max scales as √W for small W and remains below the Carnot bound. The result is independent of n and R.\n\nVerdict: The defender’s consolidated solution is correct, rigorous, and complete under the problem’s assumptions. The reference answer matches the final expression for η_max and the intermediate optimization steps.\n\nSolution (concise)\n- Given a rectangle of sides Δp, ΔV and center (p′, V′), the heat input for a clockwise cycle is\n  Q_in = W/2 + (Δp V′ + γ p′ ΔV)/(γ − 1), with W = Δp ΔV.\n- Constraining the rectangle to contain (p0, V0), minimize Q_in over its placement. Since Q_in is affine in (p′, V′) with positive coefficients, choose p′ = p0 − Δp/2, V′ = V0 − ΔV/2 (place (p0, V0) at the upper-right corner). Then\n  Q_in = [Δp V0 + γ p0 ΔV − W]/(γ − 1).\n- With area W fixed, minimize over shape: set ΔV = W/Δp and minimize F(Δp) = Δp V0 + γ p0 W/Δp. The convex minimizer satisfies Δp* = √(γ p0 W/V0), ΔV* = √(W V0/(γ p0)) and the balance Δp/ΔV = γ p0/V0.\n- At the optimum: p_high = p0, p_low = p0 − Δp*, V_high = V0, V_low = V0 − ΔV*. The minimal heat input is\n  Q_in,min = [2√(γ p0 V0 W) − W]/(γ − 1),\n  giving maximum efficiency\n  η_max = W/Q_in,min = (γ − 1)/(2√(γ p0 V0/W) − 1).\n- Validity: Requires p_low ≥ 0 and V_low ≥ 0, ensured by sufficiently small W (notably W ≤ p0 V0/γ is the tighter bound for γ > 1). For small W, η_max ≈ (γ − 1)√(W/(p0 V0))/(2√γ).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\eta_{\\max} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\,2\\sqrt{\\gamma\\, p_0 V_0 / W}\\; -\\; 1\\,} } \\]"}

There is also a small insulating sphere with a charge of $+q(q>0)$ and a mass $m$, which can be launched from a point on the inner shell with a certain velocity. The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center. If the sphere is launched from point $A$ on the inner shell and it collides with the inner shell a total of $n$ times (counting the final return to the starting point as one collision), determine the minimum launch speed $v$, ignoring gravity.\n", "solutions": "Let the distance from the center of the sphere to the position of the ball at the extreme point be $r_{1}$, and the speed be $ u_{\\mathrm{_I}}$.

The angular displacement around the center during inner and outer sphere collisions is: $$ \\alpha = {\\frac{2\\pi}{2n}} = {\\frac{\\pi}{n}} $$ The curve $AB$ is its trajectory, with point $O$ as one focus of the hyperbola, and $C$ as the other focus. According to conic section knowledge, the trajectory of the hyperbola to focus $O$ is: $$ r = \\frac{p}{e\\cos\\theta^{\\prime}-1} $$ where $\\theta^{\\prime}$ is the angle between the trajectory of the ball and its polar axis.

The problem’s intended “clean” result follows upon setting v* = v0.\n- The first integral d(r^2 θ̇) = − (q_p B/m_p) r dr is handled with correct signs; integrating yields r^2 θ̇ ∝ − r^(3/2), and regularity at r → 0 (finite tangential speed) fixes the integration constant to zero. This is equivalently justified via conservation of canonical angular momentum pθ.\n- The cusp (r → 0) is dynamically regular: θ̇ ∝ r^(−1/2) but r θ̇ ∝ r^(1/2) → 0, and r̈ remains finite.\n- Eliminating time gives dr/dθ = −√(2 A r − r^2), which integrates to r(θ) = A[1 − cos θ]; the physical branch for q_p > 0 and B upward is traced clockwise (θ̇ < 0), with θ ≤ 0, turning point at θ = −π, and closure at θ = −2π.\n- With κ = (q_p m)/(m_p q) and general v*, A = (9 a v0^2)/(8 κ^2 v*^2). For the given data κ = 3/(2√2) and the intended choice v* = v0, this reduces to r(θ) = a[1 − cos θ], in agreement with the reference solution.\n\nFinal, streamlined solution\n- Field: B(r) = m v*/(q √(a r)); define κ = (q_p m)/(m_p q). Then (q_p/m_p) B = κ v*/√(a r).\n- Azimuthal first integral (from m_p(r θ̈ + 2 ṙ θ̇) = − q_p B ṙ):\n  d(r^2 θ̇)/dr = − (q_p B/m_p) r = − κ v* √(r/a).\n  Integrate: r^2 θ̇ = − (2/3) κ v* r^(3/2)/√a + C. Regularity at r → 0 yields C = 0, so\n  θ̇ = − (2 κ v*)/(3 √(a r)).\n- Energy (speed conserved): v0^2 = ṙ^2 + r^2 θ̇^2 ⇒ ṙ^2 = v0^2 − (4 κ^2 v*^2 r)/(9 a).\n- Eliminate time:\n  dr/dθ = ṙ/θ̇ = −√[(v0^2 − α r)/(α/r)] = −√(2 A r − r^2),\n  where α = (4 κ^2 v*^2)/(9 a) and A = v0^2/(2 α) = (9 a v0^2)/(8 κ^2 v*^2).\n- Integrate with r(0) = 0:\n  r(θ) = A [1 − cos θ].\n- Specialize to the given parameters: q_p/m_p = 3q/(2√2 m) ⇒ κ = 3/(2√2). The problem intends v* = v0, hence A = 9 a/(8 κ^2) = a, yielding\n  r(θ) = a [1 − cos θ],\n  traced clockwise (θ ≤ 0), with r ∈ [0, 2a], turning at θ = −π.\n\nVerdict\n- The Defender’s final derivation is scientifically correct, resolves the initial subtlety about v in B, and matches the reference result.

The key corrections they made are:\n  - Use M = E I w'' (no absolute value).\n  - Use the correct bending energy density dU = (E I/2)(w'')^2 dx.\n  - Maintain dimensional consistency and reserve ε for strain, using ξ for the dimensionless horizontal offset (δ = ξ L).\n  - Treat w and w' as continuous at the load (no applied moment), with support boundary conditions w(±L/2) = 0.\n- Their use of Castigliano’s theorem/known-deflection formulas for a simply supported beam under an off-center point load is the cleanest route to the horizontal mode stiffness. It also makes the even-in-δ symmetry explicit, explaining why the restoring potential is quadratic with no linear term.\n\nAssessment of physics and math\n- The vertical deflection at midspan and equivalent stiffness follow standard beam formulas: λ = P L^3/(48 E I), k = 48 E I/L^3.\n- For the horizontal mode, with P = m g, a = L/2 + δ, b = L − a = L/2 − δ:\n  - Strain energy U = P^2 a^2 b^2/(6 E I L) and w(a) = ∂U/∂P = P a^2 b^2/(3 E I L).\n  - Since a^2 b^2 = (L^2/4 − δ^2)^2, w(δ) is even in δ, hence the first nonzero correction near δ = 0 is quadratic.\n  - Using Clapeyron’s theorem U = (1/2) P w, the total potential V = U − P w = −(1/2) P w(δ) gives a quadratic restoring potential in δ (or ξ) and thus a well-defined small-oscillation stiffness.\n- Kinetic energy: to quadratic order, the mass’s vertical velocity is higher order in the horizontal generalized velocity because dw/dδ|δ=0 = 0; therefore Ek = (1/2) m (L ξ̇)^2 is complete at linear order.\n- The derived frequencies are consistent and dimensionally correct. The ratio ω2^2/ω1^2 = (1/2)[m g L^2/(E a h^3)]^2 identifies the small-slope parameter σ ≪ 1 as the regime in which ω2 ≪ ω1, ensuring self-consistency of the quasi-static bending shape during horizontal oscillations.\n\nMost accurate solution and derivation\n- Geometry and material: span L, width a, thickness h, second moment I = a h^3/12, point load P = m g at x = a, simply supported at x = ±L/2. Small-slope Euler–Bernoulli, massless beam.\n- Vertical (for reference):\n  - Midspan deflection: λ = P L^3/(48 E I) = m g L^3/(4 E a h^3).\n  - Vertical stiffness: k = 48 E I/L^3 = 4 E a h^3/L^3.\n  - Vertical frequency: ω1 = √(k/m) = √(4 E a h^3/(m L^3)).\n- Horizontal mode (small offset δ = ξ L):\n  - Strain energy: U = P^2 a^2 b^2/(6 E I L).\n  - Deflection at the load: w(a) = ∂U/∂P = P a^2 b^2/(3 E I L).\n  - With a = L/2 + δ and b = L/2 − δ, a^2 b^2 = (L^2/4 − δ^2)^2, so near δ = 0:\n    - w(δ) = w0 − (P L/(6 E I)) δ^2 + O(δ^4), w0 = P L^3/(48 E I).\n  - By Clapeyron’s theorem (U = (1/2) P w), the total potential becomes\n    - V(δ) = U − P w = −(1/2) P w(δ) = const + (P^2 L/(12 E I)) δ^2 + O(δ^4).\n  - Generalized stiffness in ξ: Kξ = ∂^2V/∂ξ^2|0 = P^2 L^3/(6 E I) = 2 m^2 g^2 L^3/(E a h^3).\n  - Generalized mass: Mξ = m L^2 (since Ek = (1/2) m (L ξ̇)^2).\n  - Horizontal small-oscillation frequency:\n    - ω2 = √(Kξ/Mξ) = √(2 m g^2 L/(E a h^3)).\n\nFinal verdict\n- The Defender’s final, corrected solution is scientifically sound and the most accurate.

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession.

This is the right modeling choice and fixes the conceptual errors in the reference answer.\n\n- Linearization and result: Linearizing the coupled radial–azimuthal equations about the co-rotating equilibrium at r0 yields the standard epicyclic form. Defining the real (non-inertial) radial force Fr,real(r) = q0 E_r(r) − ρ(r) V ω^2 r, the small-oscillation frequency is\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (1/m) dFr,real/dr |r0,\nequivalently\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E′(r0) + (ρ(r0) V/m) ω^2 + (ρ′(r0) V/m) ω^2 r0.\nThese forms are dimensionally consistent, reduce to known limits (Ω = 2ω for neutrally buoyant, uniform fluid with negligible E′; Ω → √3 ω for a heavy UAV with negligible gradients), and provide a transparent stability criterion Ω^2 > 0.\n\n- What to excise from the reference answer: The attempted plasma stratification and Emax/breakdown segment are inconsistent and unnecessary for Ω. The inertial-frame expansion assuming conserved angular momentum contradicts the co-rotation constraint; the rotating-frame linearization is the correct approach.\n\n- Optional closure consistent with the problem statement: If one wishes to express ρ′ locally under the isothermal, rigidly rotating model, ρ′/ρ ≈ 2 k m̄ r with k = ω^2/(2 kB T0) and m̄ the bulk mean particle mass. Substituting at r0 gives Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E′(r0) + (ρV/m) ω^2 [1 + 2 k m̄ r0^2]. This treats E′(r0) as a local parameter and remains within the stated modeling scope.\n\nFinal verdict: The defender’s corrected derivation and compact result are the most accurate and appropriate solution to the problem.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\Omega^2 \\;=\\; 3\\,\\omega^2 \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{m}\\,\\frac{d}{dr}\\!\\left[\\,q_0\\,E_r(r)\\;-\\;\\rho(r)\\,V\\,\\omega^2 r\\,\\right]_{r=r_0}\n\\;=\\; 3\\,\\omega^2 \\;-\\; \\frac{q_0}{m}\\,E'(r_0) \\;+\\; \\frac{\\rho(r_0)\\,V}{m}\\,\\omega^2 \\;+\\; \\frac{\\rho'(r_0)\\,V}{m}\\,\\omega^2 r_0 } \\]"}
