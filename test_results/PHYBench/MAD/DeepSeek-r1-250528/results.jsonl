Now, using the trigonometric identity $\\sin^{2}\\nu+\\cos^{2}\\nu=1$, we eliminate the parameter $\\nu$:\n\n$$\n{\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}{\\mathrm{ch}}^{2}\\mu}}+{\\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2}{\\mathrm{sh}}^{2}\\mu}}=1\n$$\n\nIts physical significance is that, for an electric field, it forms a surface of equal potential. This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2).

The equation is:\n   \\[\n   I_o \\Omega + m \\Omega l^2 \\cos^2 \\theta \\cos 2\\theta = I_{\\text{edge}} \\omega.\n   \\]\n4. **Role of Friction**: Static friction is sufficiently large to prevent slipping and enable pivot transitions during collisions but does no work between collisions, validating the work-energy equation.\n\nThe derived expression for \\(\\omega\\) is consistent with fundamental physics principles, dimensional analysis, and verification cases (e.g., \\(N=3\\), \\(N=4\\), and \\(N \\to \\infty\\)).

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure.

The key points of contention centered on the accuracy of the energy conservation approach, the definition of the velocity \\(v\\), and the role of symmetry in the system.\n\n- **Energy Conservation**: The reference answer contained errors in energy accounting, specifically by using \\(\\frac{1}{2} m g l \\sin \\theta_0\\) for the initial potential energy and an inconsistent kinetic energy expression. The challenger correctly identified that the initial potential energy should be \\(m g l \\sin \\theta_0\\) for two rods, and the kinetic energy should be derived as \\(\\frac{1}{3} m l^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2\\) (sum of translational and rotational components for both rods). The defender acknowledged these errors and provided a corrected derivation. The fortuitous cancellation of errors in the reference answer does not justify its approach, as it lacks physical rigor and fails in asymmetric cases.\n\n- **Velocity Definition**: The problem's phrasing, \"velocity \\(v\\) of the rods just before the ends connected at the table touch the tabletop,\" is ambiguous. Both debaters agreed, based on kinematic analysis and context, that \\(v\\) refers to the speed of the top end (where the rods are connected by the short string). The vertical velocity of this point at \\(\\theta = 0\\) is \\(v_y = -l \\dot{\\theta}\\), with magnitude \\(l \\dot{\\theta}\\). The problem asks for \"velocity,\" but the context implies interest in the speed at impact, and the debaters concurred on providing the magnitude for clarity.\n\n- **Symmetry and Constraints**: The defender incorporated the challenger's emphasis on justifying symmetry. The identical rods, frictionless table, and top-string constraint ensure symmetric motion with one degree of freedom (\\(\\theta\\)), allowing the top end to move purely vertically. Constraint forces do no work, validating energy conservation.\n\n- **Final Solution**: The corrected derivation, agreed upon by both parties, uses proper energy accounting for two rods, specifies the top end as the point of interest, and includes symmetry justification.

Due to symmetry, the motion is described by a single generalized coordinate \\(\\theta\\), the angle each rod makes with the horizontal.\n\n- **Initial Potential Energy**:  \n  At \\(\\theta = \\theta_0\\), the center of mass height for each rod is \\(\\frac{l}{2} \\sin \\theta_0\\).

The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession. Solve for its precession angular frequency $\\Omega$ (the answer can be expressed in terms of $q_{0}$ and $r_{0}$).", "solutions": "According to the problem statement, a single ideal gas under the isothermal model can satisfy the Boltzmann distribution in any continuous potential energy field distribution.
