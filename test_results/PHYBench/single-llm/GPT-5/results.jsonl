{"id": "OPTICS/495", "questions": "In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate. This was the first time humanity recognized the relationship between electromagnetic phenomena and light phenomena. The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

A linearly polarized wave is the sum of equal-amplitude + and − circular components. After a distance d, the relative phase advance is Δφ = (ω d/c)(n_+ − n_-), so the plane of polarization rotates by\n  β = Δφ/2 = (ω d / 2c)(n_+ − n_-).\n  By definition, the Verdet constant V is the rotation per unit field per unit length: β = V B d.\n\n- Microscopic model (Lorentz oscillator with magnetic field): Take the outer-shell electrons (charge q = −e, mass m) bound harmonically with natural frequency ω0 and damping γ (we set γ → 0 at the end, as the problem states “no absorption”). Let the incident field be harmonic E(t) = Re{E e^{-iω t}} and the static magnetic field be B = B ẑ. The electron displacement r satisfies\n  m r̈ + m γ ṙ + m ω0^2 r = q E + q ṙ × B.\n  For harmonic time dependence, r(t) = Re{r e^{-iω t}}, this becomes\n  m(ω0^2 − ω^2 − iγω) r = q E + q(−iω r) × B.\n\n- Circular basis and decoupling: For B parallel to z, the equations decouple in the circular basis E_± ∝ (x̂ ± i ŷ)/√2. Writing r_± proportional to E_±, one finds the scalar relation\n  r_± = (−e/m) E_± / D_±, with D_± = (ω0^2 − ω^2 − iγω) ± ω ω_c,\n  where ω_c = eB/m is the (electron) cyclotron frequency in SI units (e > 0 is the elementary charge).\n\n- Susceptibility and refractive indices: The polarization density is P = N Z q r = N Z (−e) r, hence the circular susceptibilities are\n  χ_±(ω) = P_±/(ε0 E_±) = N Z e^2/(ε0 m) · 1/D_±.\n  The circular refractive indices are n_±^2 = 1 + χ_±. In the lossless limit (γ → 0), at a given ω we set n^2(ω) = 1 + χ0 with χ0 = N Z e^2/(ε0 m) · 1/D0 and D0 = ω0^2 − ω^2.\n\n- Expansion to first order in B (weak magneto-optic response): For small B, expand 1/D_± about D0:\n  1/D_± ≈ 1/D0 ∓ (ω ω_c)/D0^2.\n  Therefore\n  χ_± ≈ χ0 ∓ N Z e^2/(ε0 m) · (ω ω_c)/D0^2.\n  Since n_± = √(1 + χ_±), the first-order difference in indices is\n  Δn ≡ n_+ − n_- ≈ (χ_+ − χ_-)/(2n) = − [N Z e^2/(ε0 m)] · [ω ω_c]/[n D0^2].\n\n- Rotation and Verdet constant:\n  β = (ω d / 2c) Δn ⇒ V ≡ β/(B d) = (ω/(2c)) (Δn/B)\n  = − (ω/(2c)) · [N Z e^2/(ε0 m)] · [ω/(n D0^2)] · (ω_c/B).\n  Using ω_c/B = e/m and D0 = ω0^2 − ω^2, we get the explicit Lorentz-model formula:\n  V(ω) = − [N Z e^3/(2 ε0 m^2 c n)] · [ω^2/(ω0^2 − ω^2)^2].\n\n- Dispersive (Becquerel) form in terms of the material dispersion n(ω): From χ0 = n^2 − 1 and D0 = ω0^2 − ω^2,\n  dχ0/dω = −(N Z e^2/(ε0 m)) (d(1/D0)/dω) = (2 N Z e^2 ω)/(ε0 m D0^2).\n  Using d(n^2)/dω = 2n dn/dω = dχ0/dω, we obtain (N Z e^2 ω)/(ε0 m D0^2) = n dn/dω. Substituting this into Δn above yields a compact identity\n  Δn = − ω_c dn/dω.\n  Hence,\n  V(ω) = (ω/(2c)) (Δn/B) = − (ω/(2c)) (ω_c/B) dn/dω = − (e ω/(2 m c)) dn/dω.\n  Using ω = 2π c/λ, one may also write the common Becquerel formula\n  V(λ) = (e λ/(2 m c)) dn/dλ.\n\nNotes on sign and conventions\n- The sign of V depends on the convention for circular polarization and on the direction of B and propagation; many tabulations report the magnitude. The above expressions are consistent with q = −e for electrons and phase ∝ e^{-iω t}.\n- In the “normal dispersion” region (dn/dλ < 0), the Becquerel form implies V has the opposite sign to dn/dλ.\n\nSummary of results\n- General dispersive form (no absorption, real n): V(ω) = − (e ω/(2 m c)) dn/dω = (e λ/(2 m c)) dn/dλ.\n- Lorentz-oscillator form (with n the refractive index at ω): V(ω) = − [N Z e^3/(2 ε0 m^2 c n)] [ω^2/(ω0^2 − ω^2)^2].\n\nEither form may be used with β = V B d.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Verdet constant:}\\quad V(\\omega)\\equiv \\frac{\\beta}{Bd}\n= -\\,\\frac{e\\,\\omega}{2 m c}\\,\\frac{dn}{d\\omega}\n= \\frac{e\\,\\lambda}{2 m c}\\,\\frac{dn}{d\\lambda} \\\\\n&\\text{(Lorentz model, no absorption, refractive index }n\\text{ at }\\omega\\text{):}\\quad\nV(\\omega) = -\\,\\frac{N Z e^{3}}{2\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,m^{2}\\,c\\,n}\\,\n\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{(\\omega_{0}^{2}-\\omega^{2})^{2}} \\\\\n&\\text{and}\\quad \\beta = V(\\omega)\\,B\\,d\\;.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}

A short, vertical impulse is applied at the (free) right rim. After the impulse, the coin begins to rotate and translate; the contact with the table is unilateral (normal force only, no tension), so the table can push but not pull.\n\nKey modeling simplification for the marginal “just flies off” case:\n- After the impulse, the contact pressure distribution tends to concentrate at the edge line x = 0. In the limiting (minimum-speed) case that still leads to flight, the coin rotates about the table edge as a frictionless, non-adhesive pivot until it loses contact (normal reaction at the edge becomes zero). This is the standard rigid-body pendulum setup about a fixed horizontal axis through the rim.\n\nIn the cross-section (x–z plane), this reduces to a planar rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (through the rim, parallel to the disk’s axis y). Let θ be the rotation angle of the disk about that edge axis, measured from the initial flat configuration (θ = 0 when the disk is flat on the table; θ > 0 as the overhanging side moves up). The disk’s center of mass (COM) follows a circular arc of radius r about the pivot; its height is\nz_G(θ) = r sin θ.\n\nMoments of inertia:\n- About a diameter (the y-axis through the COM): I_y = (1/4) m r^2.\n- About the edge line (parallel to y) through the rim: by parallel-axis theorem\nI_p = I_y + m r^2 = (1/4) m r^2 + m r^2 = (5/4) m r^2.\n\nKinematics about the pivot:\n- If the initial COM speed (vertical) is v0 and immediately after the impulse the motion is rotation about the edge, then v0 = ω0 r, where ω0 is the initial angular speed about the edge axis.\n\nEquations of motion while in contact (rotation about the fixed pivot):\n1) Energy (gravity does work, pivot does no work):\n(1/2) I_p ω^2 + m g r sin θ = (1/2) I_p ω_0^2.

(N)\n\nLoss of contact occurs when the reaction vanishes:\nN = 0 ⇒ − r ω^2 sin θ − r α cos θ + g = 0.       (L)\n\nUse (R) to eliminate α in (L). Since α = − (m g r / I_p) cos θ, we get\n− r ω^2 sin θ − r [ − (m g r / I_p) cos θ ] cos θ + g = 0\n⇒ ω^2 sin θ − (m g r / I_p) cos^2 θ = g / r.

The quadratic f(s) is concave (−A s^2 with A > 0), so its maximum over [0,1] occurs at s = min{ ω_0^2/(2A), 1 }.\n\nWe are looking for the minimum ω_0 such that max_{s∈[0,1]} f(s) ≥ 0. For the uniform disk,\nI_p = (5/4) m r^2 ⇒ A = (m g r)/I_p = (4/5) (g / r).\n\nCheck the interior maximizer s* = ω_0^2/(2A):\nAt the threshold we will find s* ≥ 1, so the maximum over [0,1] occurs at the boundary s = 1. Therefore, the minimal ω_0 satisfies f(1) = 0:\nf(1) = ω_0^2 − A − (A + g / r) = ω_0^2 − 2A − g / r = 0.\n\nSubstitute A = (4/5) (g / r):\nω_0^2 − 2·(4/5)(g / r) − g / r = 0\n⇒ ω_0^2 = (8/5 + 1) (g / r) = (13/5) (g / r).\n\nThus the minimal initial angular speed about the edge is\nω_0,min = sqrt(13/5) sqrt(g / r).\n\nRecalling v0 = ω0 r, the minimal initial speed of the center of mass is\nv0,min = r ω_0,min = sqrt(13/5) sqrt(g r).\n\nNumerical check of consistency:\n- At lift-off (boundary case) sin θ = 1 (θ = 90°), i.e., the COM is directly above the pivot (z_G = r); the reaction just vanishes and the disk “flies off” with a nonzero angular speed ω^2 = ω_0^2 − 2A = (13/5 − 8/5)(g / r) = (g / r), consistent with the unilateral (non-adhesive) constraint.\n\nTherefore, the minimal initial COM speed required for the coin to leave the table (in the marginal case of rotation about the table edge until loss of contact) is\n\n[ \\boxed{ v_{0,\\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{13}{5}\\, g\\, r} } ].\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{v_{0,\\min}=\\sqrt{\\frac{13}{5}\\,g\\,r}} \\]"}

The centers are separated by b, with r < b < R and r + b < R so the inner lies strictly inside the outer.\n\n1) Radiative balance at a point on the outer cylinder\n\n- Let P be a point on the inner surface of the outer cylinder at polar angle θ measured from the line O2O1 (the line of centers), i.e., P = (R cosθ, R sinθ) if we take O2 at the origin and O1 at (b, 0).\n\n- For black, diffuse surfaces in an enclosure, the local net radiative heat flux leaving the surface at P equals\n  q_rad(P) = εσT2^4 − E(P) with ε = 1 (black),\n  where E(P) is the irradiance (total incident radiation) at P due to all other surfaces in the enclosure.\n\n- Because the enclosure consists only of the inner and the outer surfaces and there is no reflection (black), the irradiance can be written using a local “point view factor” F_{P→1} to the inner cylinder and F_{P→2} to the rest of the outer cylinder:\n  E(P) = σT1^4 F_{P→1} + σT2^4 F_{P→2} with F_{P→1} + F_{P→2} = 1.\n\n- Hence\n  q_rad(P) = σT2^4 − [σT1^4 F_{P→1} + σT2^4 (1 − F_{P→1})] = −σ (T1^4 − T2^4) F_{P→1}.\n\n- The power per unit area that must be supplied to the outer surface by its heat source at T2 to keep it isothermal is the negative of the net radiative loss:\n  p(θ) = −q_rad(P) = σ (T1^4 − T2^4) F_{P→1}.\n  Note: If T1 > T2, p(θ) > 0 means the outer wall is gaining net radiation from the cavity and the T2-source must remove heat (i.e., the “power absorbed from the source” would be negative). If instead you define p as the power received from the T2 source by the wall, then p_source(θ) = σ (T2^4 − T1^4) F_{P→1}.

This result can be obtained by evaluating the integral above using the parameterization of the inner circle, or via the 2D potential-theory analogy for black radiative enclosures (bipolar coordinates), and it satisfies:\n\n- Concentric check (b = 0): d = R, so F_{P→1} = r/R, which is the known uniform view factor from the outer to the inner cylinder for concentric infinite cylinders.\n\n- Reciprocity/averaging check: The circumferential average of F_{P→1} over θ must equal A1/A2 = r/R.

The small motion is about the nominal φ0 = π/4.\n- Arms are actively driven (actuated) but the legs are passive. Hinge joints can transmit torques (couples).\n- The torso is wiggled harmonically with small angular amplitude θ0 and angular frequency ω. This is the base (hip) angular excitation seen by the legs in free fall (no gravity torques in free fall).\n- To have a well-defined small-oscillation frequency (so that “resonance” is meaningful), we include a small linear torsional stiffness κ at each hip (about the symmetric equilibrium φ0). We also include a small torsional damping b at each hip, otherwise the steady-state resonance amplitude would diverge (as it must in a purely undamped, driven oscillator).\n- Mass and geometry:\n  - Mass per unit length of the uniform rods (all limbs and torso): λ.\n  - Torso length l, each arm length l, each leg length Lℓ = 1.2 l.\n  - Mass of each leg: mℓ = λ Lℓ = 1.2 λ l.\n  - Mass of torso: mT = λ l. Head mass: mh = 0.6 λ l. (The head and torso inertias affect the torque needed to drive the torso, but for the passive leg resonance amplitude under a prescribed torso base oscillation ψ(t) they do not enter the leg equation; the driving kinematics ψ(t) are taken as given.)\n- Kinematics:\n  - Let ψ(t) be the torso (base/hip) angular motion, taken as a small imposed harmonic: ψ(t) = θ0 cos(ω t).\n  - Let α± = ψ ± φ be the absolute angles of the two legs. Define x = φ − φ0 as the small deviation from φ0.\n\nMoments of inertia needed\n- Moment of inertia of one slender leg (uniform rod) of length Lℓ about its proximal hinge (the hip):\n  Ileg = (1/3) mℓ Lℓ^2 = (1/3) (1.2 λ l) (1.2 l)^2 = (1/3) · 1.728 · λ l^3 = (72/125) λ l^3 = 0.576 λ l^3.\n- The symmetric leg mode (both legs moving in/out symmetrically) has effective inertia\n  Ieff = 2 Ileg = 2 × (72/125) λ l^3 = (144/125) λ l^3 = 1.152 λ l^3.\n\nEquation of motion for the symmetric leg mode\n- Each hip has torsional stiffness κ and damping b with respect to the torso. Linearizing about φ0, the symmetric mode coordinate x = φ − φ0 obeys, under base (torso) angular excitation ψ(t),\n  Ieff ẍ + beff ẋ + keff x = − Ieff ψ̈,\n  where beff = 2 b, keff = 2 κ.\n- The right-hand side is the classical inertial base-excitation term (the “fictitious” torque in the non-inertial base), and we have included stiffness and damping so that a resonance is well-defined.\n\nSteady-state response to ψ(t) = θ0 cos(ω t)\n- With ψ(t) = θ0 cos(ω t), the forcing is −Ieff ψ̈ = +Ieff ω^2 θ0 cos(ω t + π), so the steady-state amplitude of x at frequency ω is\n  A(ω) = |x| = (Ieff ω^2 θ0) / sqrt[(keff − Ieff ω^2)^2 + (beff ω)^2].\n- The (undamped) natural frequency is ω0 = sqrt(keff / Ieff) = sqrt((2 κ)/(144/125 λ l^3)) = sqrt(125 κ / (72 λ l^3)).\n- At resonance (ω = ω0) with small damping, the steady-state amplitude is\n  Ares = (Ieff ω0^2 θ0) / (beff ω0) = (keff θ0) / (beff ω0) = θ0 sqrt(keff Ieff) / beff.\n\nInsert keff, Ieff, beff in terms of κ, b, λ, l\n- keff = 2 κ, Ieff = (144/125) λ l^3, beff = 2 b, hence\n  sqrt(keff Ieff) = sqrt( (2 κ) (144/125) λ l^3 ) = sqrt( 288/125 ) sqrt( κ λ l^3 ).\n- Therefore\n  Ares = θ0 [ sqrt(288/125) / 2 ] [ sqrt( κ λ l^3 ) / b ].\n\nA compact exact prefactor\n- Since sqrt(288/125) = 24/(5 √10), we obtain\n  Ares = θ0 [ (24/(5 √10)) / 2 ] [ sqrt( κ λ l^3 ) / b ] = θ0 [ 12/(5 √10) ] [ sqrt( κ λ l^3 ) / b ].\n\nRemarks\n- This is the steady-state resonance amplitude (in radians) of the leg half-opening angle deviation x = φ − φ0, for the symmetric leg mode, under small base (torso) angular oscillation of amplitude θ0.\n- The result is linear in the drive amplitude θ0 and inversely proportional to the hip damping b, as expected for a lightly damped driven torsional oscillator at resonance.\n- In the strictly undamped limit b → 0+, the steady-state amplitude would diverge; physically, some damping is always present. If the problem intended zero damping, the amplitude grows without bound in time at resonance, and no finite steady-state amplitude exists.\n- The head mass (given as mh = 0.6 λ l) and radius r do not enter the final amplitude when the torso motion ψ(t) is prescribed. They would matter if one instead solved for ψ(t) induced by a specified internal shoulder actuation (torque or arm motion) under the global zero external torque constraint; in that more complete actuation-to-response problem, the trunk (torso+head) inertia would enter the mapping from arm drive to the base motion ψ(t). Here, with ψ(t) taken as given, the passive leg resonance amplitude depends only on the leg inertia and hip viscoelasticity.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ A_{\\mathrm{res}} \\;=\\; \\left|\\phi-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right|_{\\mathrm{res}} \\;=\\; \\frac{12}{5\\sqrt{10}}\\;\\frac{\\theta_{0}}{b}\\;\\sqrt{\\kappa\\,\\lambda\\,l^{3}}\\;,\\quad \\text{with}\\;\\;\\omega_{0}=\\sqrt{\\frac{125\\,\\kappa}{72\\,\\lambda\\,l^{3}}} } \\]"}

The lower ends of the two strings are attached to the two endpoints of a rigid, uniform semicircular wire (a half–hoop) of radius R and mass m. The bead of mass m sits at the lowest point (the “bottom”) of the semicircle. The plane of motion is the plane of the hoop.\n- Denote by a = 2R the distance between the two lower attachment points (the endpoints of the semicircle).\n- In the symmetric equilibrium, the two lower attachment points lie a vertical distance h below the ceiling line joining the upper supports, and the two strings make an angle α with the vertical such that\n  sin α = (d − a)/(2L),  cos α = h/L,  h = √[L^2 − ((d − a)/2)^2].\n- The total mass of the moving assembly is M = 2m (the semicircular arc of mass m plus the bead of mass m). For the small-amplitude “swing” mode where the whole lower assembly translates laterally without rotating (to first order), its center of mass behaves like a simple pendulum of effective length h = L cos α. Consequently, for this symmetric mode the small-oscillation equation is\n  ü + (g/h) u = 0,\n  where u(t) is the small horizontal displacement of the assembly’s center of mass (CM).\n\nTension balance and the zero-tension condition\n\nLet T_L and T_R be the tensions in the left and right strings, directed along the strings. Project Newton’s second law for the whole assembly (rigid semicircle + bead) onto the horizontal and vertical axes.

Using tan 2α ≈ 2α, sin α ≈ α, cos α ≈ 1, the boundary condition reduces to\n2 |α| ≈ 2 √(E0/(m g L))  ⇒  α* ≈ √(E0/(m g L)).\n\nHence\nd_max ≈ 2R + 2 L α* ≈ 2R + 2 √(L E0/(m g)).\n\nRemarks on modeling assumptions\n\n- The semicircular arc is rigid; the bead can move frictionlessly along it. To linear order about the symmetric configuration with the bead at the bottom, the bead’s tangential degree of freedom decouples from the symmetric swing (translation) of the whole assembly. Therefore the effective translating mass is simply M = 2m, and the symmetric-mode frequency depends only on h = L cos α.\n- The antisymmetric (“rocking”) mode changes the difference in tensions but does not help produce the specific horizontal CM acceleration needed for T_L = 0, so concentrating the total energy into the symmetric mode is optimal for achieving a slack string within the given E0.\n\nSummary\n\n- Exact boundary (parametric): choose α* solving tan^2 2α* = 4 E0 /(m g L cos α*), then d_max = 2R + 2 L sin α*.\n- Small-angle closed form: d_max ≈ 2R + 2 √(L E0/(m g)).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Let }\\alpha^*\\text{ be the (small) solution of}\\quad \\tan^2(2\\alpha^*)=\\frac{4E_0}{m g\\,L\\cos\\alpha^*}.\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{Then}\\quad d_{\\max}=2R+2L\\sin\\alpha^*.\\\\[6pt]\n&\\text{For small angles (small oscillations), }d_{\\max}\\simeq 2R+2\\sqrt{\\frac{L\\,E_0}{m g}}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}

The total for length L is just multiplied by L.\n\nWe will use the geometry constant\nC0 = L π / acosh(D/R),\nso that in a homogeneous medium with parameter κ, the admittance is Yhom(s) = C0 κ.\n\nTwo half-spaces with different κ1(s), κ2(s)\nIn our problem, κ1(s) = σ1 + s ε1 in y > 0 and κ2(s) = σ2 + s ε2 in y < 0. The electrodes are centered on the interface y = 0, and the boundary at infinity is unbounded. By linearity, the admittance must be an affine linear functional of κ1 and κ2,\nY(s) = A κ1(s) + B κ2(s),\nwith A, B depending only on geometry. Two constraints determine A and B:\n\n1) If κ1 = κ2 = κ (homogeneous medium), then Y(s) must reduce to Yhom(s) = C0 κ. Hence A + B = C0.\n\n2) If the lower half is insulating, κ2 = 0, then the interface y = 0 acts as a symmetry (Neumann) plane for this symmetric electrode placement, and the current flows entirely in the upper half-plane; by the method of images one finds the half-space admittance equals half the full-space value: Y = (1/2) C0 κ1. Thus A = C0/2. By symmetry, B = C0/2.\n\nTherefore\nY(s) = (C0/2) [κ1(s) + κ2(s)] = (C0/2) [(σ1 + σ2) + s (ε1 + ε2)].\n\nExtracting the effective DC conductance G and capacitance C of the electrolyte between the two electrodes:\nG = (C0/2) (σ1 + σ2) = L π (σ1 + σ2) / [2 acosh(D/R)],\nC = (C0/2) (ε1 + ε2) = L π (ε1 + ε2) / [2 acosh(D/R)].\n\nEquivalent one-port seen by the source\nThe electrolyte between the two electrodes is equivalent to a resistor G in parallel with a capacitor C (a “leaky capacitor”) with admittance Y(s) = G + s C.\n\nThe source has emf U and internal resistance r0 in series with this parallel G‖C. Let v(t) be the voltage across the electrolyte one-port. The branch current is i(t) = C dv/dt + G v. The KVL with the source gives\nU = r0 i + v.\n\nWith initial condition v(0) = 0 (initially uncharged), the ODE\nr0 C dv/dt + (1 + r0 G) v = U\nhas the solution\nv(t) = U / (1 + r0 G) [1 − exp(−t/τ)],\nwhere τ = r0 C / (1 + r0 G).\n\nThe source current i(t) = C dv/dt + G v then becomes\ni(t) = U/r0 exp(−t/τ) + (G U)/(1 + r0 G) [1 − exp(−t/τ)].\n\nThis can also be written in the standard “approach to steady state” form:\n- Initial current: i(0+) = U/r0 (capacitor initially short-circuits the branch).\n- Steady current: i(∞) = (G U)/(1 + r0 G) = U / (r0 + 1/G).\n- Time constant: τ = r0 C / (1 + r0 G). In the limit r0 ≫ 1/G, τ ≈ C/G = (ε1 + ε2)/(σ1 + σ2), the Maxwell–Wagner (dielectric relaxation) time of the two-half-space medium; in the opposite limit r0 → 0, τ → 0.\n\nCollecting everything explicitly\n- acosh(D/R) = ln[D/R + sqrt((D/R)^2 − 1)].\n- G = L π (σ1 + σ2) / [2 acosh(D/R)].\n- C = L π (ε1 + ε2) / [2 acosh(D/R)].\n- i(t) = U/r0 exp[−t (1 + r0 G)/(r0 C)] + (G U)/(1 + r0 G) [1 − exp(−t (1 + r0 G)/(r0 C))].\n\nConsistency checks\n- If σ1 = σ2 = σ and ε1 = ε2 = ε, then G = L π σ / acosh(D/R) and C = L π ε / acosh(D/R), exactly the homogeneous-medium result, and i(t) reduces to the familiar source–resistor–capacitor transient.\n- If σ2 → 0, ε2 → 0 (lower half insulating), then G and C are each half of the homogeneous y > 0 half-space values, as expected by symmetry.\n- The ratio C/G = (ε1 + ε2)/(σ1 + σ2) is geometry-independent (a hallmark of Maxwell–Wagner polarization in layered media).\n\n### Final Answer\nLet acosh(x) = ln(x + sqrt(x^2 − 1)). Define\nG = L π (σ1 + σ2) / [2 acosh(D/R)],  and  C = L π (ε1 + ε2) / [2 acosh(D/R)].\nWith source internal resistance r0, the current through the source after a step connection at t = 0 is\n[ \\boxed{\\, i(t) \\;=\\; \\frac{U}{r_0}\\, e^{-t/\\tau} \\;+\\; \\frac{G\\,U}{1 + r_0 G}\\,\\bigl[1 - e^{-t/\\tau}\\bigr], \\quad \\tau \\;=\\; \\frac{r_0\\,C}{1 + r_0 G}, \\quad G \\;=\\; \\frac{L \\pi (\\sigma_1+\\sigma_2)}{2\\,\\mathrm{acosh}(D/R)}, \\quad C \\;=\\; \\frac{L \\pi (\\varepsilon_1+\\varepsilon_2)}{2\\,\\mathrm{acosh}(D/R)} \\,} ]"}
{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field.

This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2).

The metric scale factors are obtained from r_μ = ∂r/∂μ, r_ν = ∂r/∂ν, r_φ = ∂r/∂φ. A straightforward calculation gives\nh_μ = h_ν = h = a sqrt(cosh^2 μ − cos^2 ν),\nh_φ = a cosh μ cos ν.\nThe Jacobian is J = h_μ h_ν h_φ = a^3 (cosh^2 μ − cos^2 ν) (cosh μ cos ν).\n\n2) Field lines along μ and Laplace’s equation\nTo make the field lines coincide with μ-curves, we take the potential V = V(μ) only. Then E = −∇V is along e_μ:\n∇V = e_μ (1/h) dV/dμ, hence E = − e_μ (1/h) dV/dμ.\nIn a charge-free region (away from the plane z = 0), V must satisfy Laplace’s equation. In orthogonal coordinates,\n∇^2 V = 1/(h_μ h_ν h_φ) ∂/∂μ [ (h_ν h_φ / h_μ) dV/dμ ].\nSince h_μ = h_ν = h, this reduces to\n∇^2 V = 1/(h^2 h_φ) ∂/∂μ [ h_φ dV/dμ ] = 0\n⇒ ∂/∂μ [ h_φ dV/dμ ] = 0.\nBecause h_φ = a cosh μ cos ν and V depends only on μ, the quantity h_φ dV/dμ must be independent of μ for each (ν, φ). The only way this can hold for all ν is\na cosh μ cos ν dV/dμ = A cos ν, with A a constant,\ni.e.\ndV/dμ = A/(a cosh μ).\n\nIntegrating,\nV(μ) = (A/a) ∫ dμ / cosh μ + const = (A/a) 2 arctan[tanh(μ/2)] + const.\n\n3) Fixing the amplitude and sign from E0 at the origin\nWe require that near the origin (ρ = 0, z = 0) the field magnitude be E0 and point upward for z > 0. The origin corresponds to μ = 0, ν = π/2 (since ρ = a cosh μ cos ν and z = a sinh μ sin ν). There,\nh(μ=0, ν=π/2) = a, cosh μ = 1.\nThe field is\nE = − e_μ (1/h) dV/dμ = − e_μ (1/a) (A/(a cosh μ)) = − (A/a^2) e_μ.\nAt ν = π/2, e_μ points along +z for z > 0, so we need E = +E0 e_z there. Thus choose A = − a^2 E0. Then\ndV/dμ = − a E0 / cosh μ,\nV(μ) = − a E0 ∫ dμ / cosh μ + const = − a E0 [ 2 arctan(tanh(μ/2)) ] + const.\nChoosing V → 0 as μ → ∞ (far field), and noting arctan(tanh(μ/2)) → π/4 as μ → ∞, we set\nV(μ) = a E0 [ π/2 − 2 arctan(tanh(μ/2)) ].\nThe electric field everywhere (away from the source) is then\nE(μ,ν) = − e_μ (1/h) dV/dμ = e_μ E0 / [ cosh μ sqrt(cosh^2 μ − cos^2 ν) ].\n\n4) Where the plane z = 0 lies in (μ, ν)\nFrom the coordinate mapping, the plane z = 0 is covered by:\n- the disk ρ ≤ a as μ = 0 with ρ = a cos ν (0 ≤ ν ≤ π/2), and\n- the exterior ρ ≥ a as ν = 0 with ρ = a cosh μ (μ ≥ 0).\nThus the plane splits into two regions: inside the circle ρ < a is on the μ = 0 boundary; outside the circle ρ > a sits at ν = 0.\n\n5) Normal field just above the plane and surface charge σ(ρ)\nThe normal to the plane z = 0 is along e_z, so the surface charge σ on the plane is determined by the jump of the normal field:\nσ(ρ) = ε0 [E_z(0^+,ρ) − E_z(0^−,ρ)].\nBy symmetry of our construction (field lines point upward for z > 0 and downward for z < 0), E_z(0^−,ρ) = − E_z(0^+,ρ). Therefore\nσ(ρ) = 2 ε0 E_z(0^+,ρ).\n\nWe need E_z just above z = 0. The z-component of e_μ is\ne_μ · e_z = (r_μ · e_z)/|r_μ| = (a cosh μ sin ν) / h = cosh μ sin ν / sqrt(cosh^2 μ − cos^2 ν).\nTherefore\nE_z = |E| (e_μ · e_z) = [ E0 / (cosh μ sqrt(cosh^2 μ − cos^2 ν)) ] × [ cosh μ sin ν / sqrt(cosh^2 μ − cos^2 ν) ]\n= E0 sin ν / (cosh^2 μ − cos^2 ν).\n\n- Inside the circle, ρ < a: points on the plane correspond to μ = 0 and ρ = a cos ν, so cos ν = ρ/a, sin ν = sqrt(1 − (ρ/a)^2), and cosh μ = 1. Hence\nE_z(0^+,ρ) = E0 sin ν / (1 − cos^2 ν) = E0 / sin ν = E0 / sqrt(1 − (ρ/a)^2) = (a E0) / sqrt(a^2 − ρ^2).\nThus\nσ(ρ) = 2 ε0 E_z(0^+,ρ) = 2 ε0 E0 / sqrt(1 − (ρ/a)^2) = (2 ε0 a E0)/sqrt(a^2 − ρ^2), for 0 ≤ ρ < a.\n\n- Outside the circle, ρ > a: points on the plane correspond to ν = 0 (with μ fixed by ρ = a cosh μ). There sin ν = 0, so E_z(0^+,ρ) = 0 and therefore σ(ρ) = 0 for ρ > a.\n\nThus the source that generates exactly this tubular, axisymmetric, divergence-free field is a circular disk of radius a lying in the plane z = 0, with a radially varying surface charge density that diverges like 1/√(a^2 − ρ^2) at the edge.\n\n6) Consistency checks\n- Near the origin (ρ → 0) we have sin ν → 1, so E_z(0^+,0) = E0 as required.\n- The field is divergence-free away from the plane by construction: ∂/∂μ [h_φ dV/dμ] = ∂/∂μ [a cosh μ cos ν (−a E0/ cosh μ)] = ∂/∂μ [− a^2 E0 cos ν] = 0.\n- The total charge on the disk is Q = ∫_0^a σ(ρ) 2πρ dρ = 4π ε0 E0 a^2.\n\nTherefore the unique axisymmetric tubular electrostatic field with field lines along oblate-spheroidal μ-curves and magnitude E0 near the origin is produced by a charged circular disk of radius a in the plane z = 0 with the surface charge density found above.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\sigma(\\rho)=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{2\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,E_{0}}{\\sqrt{1-(\\rho/a)^{2}}}\n=\\dfrac{2\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,a\\,E_{0}}{\\sqrt{a^{2}-\\rho^{2}}}, & 0\\le \\rho<a,\\\\[8pt]\n0, & \\rho>a,\n\\end{cases}\n}\n\\]"}

Near the bottom, the distance from the big center C to the ellipse’s center O is R − h(ψ), where h is the support function of the ellipse in the direction ψ of the normal.

The conductor and the adjacent polarization layer are to be treated as a single body for force purposes.\n\nKey idea\n- The most reliable way to get the net force on the body (conductor plus its interfacial polarization charges) is to use the Maxwell stress tensor in the dielectric and integrate over a closed surface that encloses the body and all its immediate bound charges. A convenient choice is a very large sphere at infinity, where the field is the simple superposition of the applied uniform field and the Coulomb field of the net charge Q (the induced dipole field decays faster and will not contribute to the net force in the large-sphere limit).\n\nFields at large distances\n- In the dielectric, far from the sphere, the total electric field can be written as\n  E(r) = E0 + EQ(r) + ED(r),\n  where\n  - E0 is the uniform applied field (constant),\n  - EQ(r) is the field of the net charge Q in the dielectric,\n  - ED(r) is the induced dipole field caused by the presence of the conducting sphere in the uniform field (decays as 1/r^3).\n- The Coulomb field in a linear dielectric is\n  EQ(r) = (1/(4π ε)) (Q/r^2) r̂.\n- At large r, ED ∼ 1/r^3 and will not affect the net force after integration, as shown below. Hence only E0 and EQ matter for the net force.\n\nMaxwell stress tensor and force integral\n- In electrostatics (no magnetic field), the Maxwell stress tensor in a linear dielectric is\n  T = ε (E E − 1/2 E^2 I),\n  with ε = ε0 εr.\n- The net force on the enclosed body is\n  F = ∮S T · n dA,\n  where S is a closed surface taken in the dielectric and n is the outward unit normal.\n- We evaluate the force on a very large spherical surface of radius R_s → ∞. Decompose E = E0 + EQ + ED. Then T is quadratic in E; keep only the terms that survive the R_s → ∞ integration.\n\nScaling and surviving terms\n- The uniform-field-only term T(E0) gives zero net force by symmetry upon integration over a sphere.\n- Terms quadratic in EQ or ED scale like 1/r^4 and 1/r^6 in T, integrating to zero as R_s → ∞.\n- Cross terms involving ED decay at least as 1/r^3 in E, hence 1/r^3 in T, yielding contributions ∼ 1/r on integration, which vanish as R_s → ∞.\n- The only possibly nonzero contribution at infinity comes from the cross term between E0 and EQ, which scales as 1/r^2 in T, giving a finite contribution.\n\nExplicit evaluation of the E0–EQ cross term\n- Write the stress tensor linearized in EQ:\n  T_cross = ε [E0 EQ + EQ E0 − (E0 · EQ) I].\n- The force from this term is\n  F = ∮S T_cross · n dA = ε ∮S [(E0 · n) EQ + (EQ · n) E0 − (E0 · EQ) n] dA.\n- On the spherical surface, EQ is radial: EQ = |EQ| n, with |EQ| = Q/(4π ε R_s^2).\n  Also E0 · n is the cosine projection of E0 on n, and E0 · EQ = |EQ| (E0 · n).\n- Substituting these into the integrand:\n  (E0 · n) EQ = (E0 · n) |EQ| n,\n  (EQ · n) E0 = |EQ| E0,\n  (E0 · EQ) n = |EQ| (E0 · n) n.\n  The first and third terms cancel exactly, leaving\n  F = ε ∮S |EQ| E0 dA.\n- Since |EQ| = Q/(4π ε R_s^2) is constant over the large sphere, and ∮S dA = 4π R_s^2, we get\n  F = ε E0 [Q/(4π ε R_s^2)] (4π R_s^2) = Q E0.\n\nConclusions and comments\n- The net force vector on the conducting sphere (together with its interfacial polarization charges) is F = Q E0.\n- Its magnitude is |F| = |Q| E0.\n- The result is independent of the sphere radius R and of the dielectric constant εr. Physically, in a uniform field the induced dipole produces no net force; only the net free charge Q couples to the uniform field, and the appropriate field to use is the macroscopic applied field E0 in the dielectric.\n- Direction: along E0 if Q > 0, opposite E0 if Q < 0.\n- Consistency checks:\n  - If Q = 0, F = 0, as expected for a neutral sphere in a uniform field.\n  - If E0 = 0, F = 0, as expected.\n\nAlternative derivation (energy method)\n- Let φ_ext be the potential of the distant sources that generate E0 in the dielectric (excluding the sphere’s own fields). In a uniform field, φ_ext(x) = −E0 · x + const. The electrostatic energy associated with placing a net charge Q at position x in this field is U = Q φ_ext(x) = −Q E0 · x. Translating the sphere by δx changes U by δU = −Q E0 · δx, hence the force is F = −∇U = Q E0. This agrees with the stress-tensor result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{F = |Q|\\,E_{0}}\\]"}

Therefore,\n⟨E(R + ρ)⟩_θ = E0 cos(k Y) J0(k ρ) x̂,\nand the gyroaveraged E × B drift is\nV_gc,⊥(R) = [E0 cos(k Y) J0(k ρ) x̂ × (B ẑ)]/B^2\n          = - (E0/B) cos(k Y) J0(k ρ) ŷ.\n\nThus, to first order in the weak field (i.e., neglecting the slow evolution of Y during the gyroaverage), the guiding-center perpendicular drift is purely along ŷ with magnitude reduced by the finite-Larmor-radius (FLR) factor J0(k ρ).\n\n3) Lowest-order approximation distinguishing uniform-E from nonuniform-E\n- In a strictly uniform E (k = 0), J0(0) = 1 and cos(k Y) = 1, so V_gc,⊥ = -(E0/B) ŷ, the familiar E × B drift, which is species independent and independent of v⊥.\n- For k ρ ≪ 1 (E varying slowly across the orbit), the first nontrivial FLR correction is obtained from\nJ0(k ρ) ≈ 1 - (k^2 ρ^2)/4 + O((k ρ)^4).\nHence,\nV_gc,⊥ ≈ - (E0/B) cos(k Y) [1 - (k^2 ρ^2)/4] ŷ + O((k ρ)^4).\nThis O((k ρ)^2) factor is the lowest order that distinguishes the nonuniform-E case from the uniform-E case; it makes the drift (slightly) dependent on the orbit size ρ and thus on v⊥ and species.\n\n4) Expressing the result in terms of the given initial conditions\n- ρ = m v⊥/(|q| B).\n- The guiding-center Y at t = 0 (to zeroth order in the weak E) is\nY = y0 - (v⊥/Ω) cos δ = y0 - sgn(q) ρ cos δ,\nso one may write the drift in terms of Y or equivalently in terms of the initial data. The parallel (z) motion is unaffected by E⊥ and remains v_gc,∥ = vz.\n\nSummary:\n- Exact gyroaverage (to first order in E, but exact in k ρ for the sinusoidal E):\nV_gc,⊥ = - (E0/B) J0(k ρ) cos(k Y) ŷ,\nwith ρ = m v⊥/(|q| B) and Y = y0 - (v⊥/Ω) cos δ.\n- Lowest-order FLR correction for k ρ ≪ 1:\nV_gc,⊥ ≈ - (E0/B) cos(k Y) [1 - (k^2 ρ^2)/4] ŷ.\n\nNote:\n- The result reduces to the usual E × B drift evaluated at the guiding-center position when k ρ → 0: V_gc,⊥ → - (E0/B) cos(k Y) ŷ.\n- The correction factor J0(k ρ) encodes the finite-Larmor-radius averaging of the nonuniform E across the orbit; for large k ρ the drift is reduced and oscillates with k ρ.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{With } B = B\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}},\\quad E = E_0 \\cos(k y)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}},\\ \\ \\Omega \\equiv \\frac{qB}{m},\\ \\ \\rho \\equiv \\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q| B},\\\\\n&\\text{the gyroaveraged (guiding-center) perpendicular drift is}\\\\\n&\\qquad \\mathbf{V}_{\\rm gc,\\perp}(Y) \\;=\\; \\left\\langle \\frac{\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{R}+\\boldsymbol{\\rho})\\times \\mathbf{B}}{B^2} \\right\\rangle_{\\theta}\n\\;=\\; -\\,\\frac{E_0}{B}\\,J_0(k \\rho)\\,\\cos(k Y)\\, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}},\\\\\n&\\text{where } Y = y_0 - \\frac{v_\\perp}{\\Omega}\\cos\\delta \\ \\text{ at } t=0.\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{For } k\\rho \\ll 1:\\quad \\mathbf{V}_{\\rm gc,\\perp} \\;\\approx\\; -\\,\\frac{E_0}{B}\\,\\cos(k Y)\\,\\Big(1 - \\tfrac{k^2 \\rho^2}{4}\\Big)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}

The spring force is radial; if the bead is at radius r, the spring force magnitude is K_s|r − L/4| and it acts inward if r > L/4, outward if r < L/4.\n- Gravity is vertical; motion and forces of interest are radial in the horizontal plane, so gravity does not enter the radial balance.\n\nKey physical relation\nIn uniform circular motion with angular speed ω at radius r, the bead requires inward centripetal force m ω^2 r. Writing inward as positive, the radial force balance (in the inertial frame) at any equilibrium radius r is:\nF_spring,inward + F_electric,inward = m ω^2 r.\n\nTwo equilibrium conditions\n\n1) At the triggering point A (before switching), r = L and the central charge is +Q (repulsive). The spring is stretched (L > L/4), so its inward pull is K_s(L − L/4) = K_s(3L/4). The electric force is outward with magnitude k Q q / L^2, so its inward contribution is −k Q q / L^2. Thus\nK_s(3L/4) − k Q q / L^2 = m ω^2 L.    (1)\n\n2) After switching, the central charge is −Q (attractive). When the bead reattains radial equilibrium at B with r = OB = L/2, the spring (still stretched) pulls inward with K_s(L/2 − L/4) = K_s(L/4). The electric force is inward with magnitude k Q q / (L/2)^2 = 4 k Q q / L^2. Thus\nK_s(L/4) + 4 k Q q / L^2 = m ω^2 (L/2).    (2)\n\nRemark on ω\nThe device cuts off external torque at the trigger, so the drive no longer changes ω; in the usual idealization (no dissipation and no external torques thereafter), the angular speed achieved at triggering is maintained. Moreover, both equations (1) and (2) describe states where the bead is at rest relative to the tube (no radial motion), hence no tangential constraint torque at those instants. We therefore take the same ω in (1) and (2). The unknown spring constant K_s will be eliminated.\n\nSolving for ω\nFrom (1):\nK_s = [m ω^2 L + k Q q / L^2] / (3L/4) = (4/3) [ m ω^2 + (k Q q)/L^3 ].\n\nFrom (2):\nK_s = [ m ω^2 (L/2) − 4 k Q q / L^2 ] / (L/4) = 2 m ω^2 − 16 (k Q q)/L^3.\n\nEquate the two expressions for K_s:\n(4/3) [ m ω^2 + (k Q q)/L^3 ] = 2 m ω^2 − 16 (k Q q)/L^3.\n\nMultiply through by 3 and collect terms:\n4 m ω^2 + 4 (k Q q)/L^3 = 6 m ω^2 − 48 (k Q q)/L^3\n⇒ 2 m ω^2 = 52 (k Q q)/L^3\n⇒ ω^2 = 26 (k Q q)/(m L^3).\n\nTherefore,\nω = sqrt[ 26 k Q q / (m L^3) ].\n\nDimensional check\n[k Q q] has units N·m^2 = kg·m^3/s^2; dividing by m L^3 gives s^−2; square root gives s^−1.

Their resultant R balances the weight mg and must point vertically upward.\n- For zero net torque about the frame’s center of mass C, the line of action of R must pass through C. Therefore O must lie vertically above C, and the angle bisector of the two string directions at O is the vertical line through C.\n\nGeometry and notation:\n- Place the origin at the frame’s center C, with y-axis vertical and x-axis horizontal.

We analyze the bound pair X2 in the center-of-momentum (zero total momentum) frame C, then treat its breakup by an ultra-relativistic projectile in the lab frame L where X2 is at rest.\n\nPart I: Maximum coupling αc for a stable ground state (n = 1)\n\nA simple and accurate way to capture the relativistic binding (for equal masses in a −α/r potential) is a relativistic Bohr/variational estimate, which also reproduces the correct nonrelativistic limit.\n\nMethod 1 (uncertainty + relativistic energy minimization):\n- In the CM frame, let r be the separation and p ∼ ħ/r the characteristic relative momentum (uncertainty principle).\n- The total energy of the pair as a function of r is approximately\nE(r) ≈ 2 sqrt{(pc)^2 + (M c^2)^2} − α/r = 2 sqrt{(ħ c/r)^2 + (M c^2)^2} − α/r.\nLet x ≡ 1/r and y ≡ ħ c x. Then\nE(y) = 2 sqrt{y^2 + (M c^2)^2} − (α/ħ c) y.\nMinimize E with respect to y:\ndE/dy = 2 y / sqrt{y^2 + (M c^2)^2} − g = 0,\nwhere g ≡ α/(ħ c) is the dimensionless coupling.\nThis yields\n2 y / sqrt{y^2 + (M c^2)^2} = g\n⇒ 4 y^2 = g^2 (y^2 + M^2 c^4)\n⇒ y^2 = [g^2/(4 − g^2)] M^2 c^4,\nwhich is only real if 4 − g^2 > 0, i.e.,\ng < 2  ⇔  α < 2 ħ c.\nAt the minimum,\nsqrt{y^2 + M^2 c^4} = 2 M c^2 / sqrt{4 − g^2},\nand\nE_min = 2 sqrt{y^2 + M^2 c^4} − g y\n= 2·(2 M c^2)/√(4 − g^2) − M c^2 g^2/√(4 − g^2)\n= M c^2 √(4 − g^2)\n= 2 M c^2 √(1 − (g/2)^2)\n= 2 M c^2 √(1 − (α/(2 ħ c))^2).\nThis shows the ground-state energy is positive and bounded as long as α < 2 ħ c, and it collapses (no minimum) when α ≥ 2 ħ c. Therefore\nαc = 2 ħ c.\n\nMethod 2 (relativistic Bohr model, circular ground state):\nIn the CM frame, let the interparticle separation be R. Each mass M orbits the CM with speed v at radius R/2. Then:\n- Force balance (centripetal): α/R^2 = (γ M v^2)/(R/2) = 2 γ M v^2 / R, where γ = 1/√(1 − v^2/c^2).\n- Total orbital angular momentum L = 2 (R/2 · γ M v) = R γ M v. Bohr quantization (for the circular n state): L = n ħ.\nEliminate R using R = n ħ/(γ M v) in the force balance to obtain\nα = 2 n ħ v.\nThus β ≡ v/c = α/(2 n ħ c) = g/(2 n). The total energy of the pair (rest + kinetic + potential) evaluates to\nE_n = 2 γ M c^2 − α/R = 2 γ M c^2 − 2 γ M v^2 = 2 M c^2 √(1 − β^2)\n= 2 M c^2 √(1 − (α/(2 n ħ c))^2).\nA real bound state requires α/(2 n ħ c) < 1. For the ground state n = 1 this gives α < 2 ħ c, reproducing αc found above.\n\nHence, the maximum α for a stable n = 1 bound state is\nαc = 2 ħ c.\n\nPart II: Minimal beam energy E1 to dissociate X2 (with α = αc/2) by an ultra-relativistic projectile\n\nSet α = αc/2 = ħ c ⇒ g = α/(ħ c) = 1. From the energy eigenvalue above (n = 1),\nE_pair = 2 M c^2 √(1 − (g/2)^2) = 2 M c^2 √(1 − 1/4) = 2 M c^2 (√3/2) = √3 M c^2.\nThus the rest energy (in lab, where X2 is at rest) is E_pair, corresponding to an effective rest mass\nM2 = E_pair / c^2 = √3 M.\n\nWe now bombard X2 (at rest) with an ultra-relativistic projectile whose rest mass is negligible (effectively massless), of lab energy E. We ask for the minimum E needed to break X2 into two free X’s. The reaction kinematics at threshold is most simply handled with the invariant s:\n- Initial 4-momenta: target P = (M2 c, 0) and projectile k = (E/c, p), with k^2 = 0 ⇒ |p| = E/c.\n- Invariant s is\ns = (P + k)^2 = M2^2 c^2 + 2 M2 E,\nin units where c = 1: s = M2^2 + 2 M2 E.\n- At threshold for producing two free particles X of mass M (and allowing also an emitted photon, which does not raise the minimal invariant mass because its rest mass is zero), the minimal required invariant mass is\ns_th = (2 M c^2)^2  (i.e. s_th = 4 M^2 in c = 1 units).\nEquating s = s_th at threshold gives\nM2^2 + 2 M2 E1 = 4 M^2  ⇒  E1 = (4 M^2 − M2^2) / (2 M2).\nInsert M2 = √3 M:\nE1 = [4 M^2 − (√3 M)^2] / (2 √3 M) = (4 − 3) M / (2 √3) = M/(2 √3).\nRestoring c,\nE1 = (M c^2)/(2 √3).\n\nAs a consistency check, define the CM Q-value (binding energy to be supplied) as\nQ = 2 M c^2 − M2 c^2 = (2 − √3) M c^2.\nFor a massless projectile on a target at rest, the lab threshold satisfies\nE1 = Q + Q^2/(2 M2 c^2) = (2 − √3) M c^2 + [(2 − √3)^2/(2 √3)] M c^2 = (M c^2)/(2 √3),\nin agreement with the invariant-mass result above. The mention of an emitted photon does not lower the threshold; at threshold its energy can be arbitrarily small in the CM.\n\nSummary:\n- Stability requires α < αc = 2 ħ c.\n- With α = αc/2, the bound-pair rest energy is E_pair = √3 M c^2, and the minimal beam energy to dissociate X2 at rest in the lab (with a massless/ultra-relativistic projectile) is\nE1 = (M c^2)/(2 √3).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,\\alpha_{c} = 2\\,\\hbar c,\\qquad E_{1} = \\frac{M c^{2}}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\,}\n\\]"}

Therefore, the net phase difference at P is\nφ = [phase of A] − [phase of B] = Φ_int − Δϕ_air,in = Φ_int − 2 k0 β S.\n\n4) Eliminate S and simplify\nUsing the expressions above,\nΦ_int = 2 k0 ∫_0^d n^2(y)/√(n^2(y) − β^2) dy,\n2 k0 β S = 2 k0 ∫_0^d β^2/√(n^2(y) − β^2) dy.\nThus\nφ = 2 k0 ∫_0^d [n^2(y) − β^2]/√(n^2(y) − β^2) dy\n  = 2 k0 ∫_0^d √(n^2(y) − β^2) dy.\n\nThis compact integral form already contains no S and is the most transparent result:\nφ = (4π/λ) ∫_0^d √(n^2(y) − sin^2 i) dy,\nwith n(y) = n_a + (n_b − n_a)(y/d).\n\n5) Closed form for a linear profile\nSet α = (n_b − n_a)/d and β = sin i. Let\nF(n) = (1/2) [ n √(n^2 − β^2) − β^2 ln(n + √(n^2 − β^2)) ].\nThen, with dy = dn/α,\n∫_0^d √(n^2(y) − β^2) dy = (1/α) ∫_{n_a}^{n_b} √(n^2 − β^2) dn = (1/α)[F(n_b) − F(n_a)].\nTherefore\nφ = 2 k0 · (1/α)[F(n_b) − F(n_a)]\n  = (2π/λ) · (2/α)[F(n_b) − F(n_a)]\n  = (2π/λ) · (d/(n_b − n_a)) · 2[F(n_b) − F(n_a)].\n\nSince F(n) as defined already contains the 1/2, it is simpler to write directly\nφ = (k0/α) [ n √(n^2 − β^2) − β^2 ln(n + √(n^2 − β^2)) ]_{n_a}^{n_b}.\n\nExplicitly,\nφ = (2π d)/(λ (n_b − n_a)) × { n_b √(n_b^2 − sin^2 i) − n_a √(n_a^2 − sin^2 i)\n                               − sin^2 i ln[ (n_b + √(n_b^2 − sin^2 i)) / (n_a + √(n_a^2 − sin^2 i)) ] }.\n\n6) Consistency check (uniform film limit)\nIf n_a = n_b = n (uniform film), the integral reduces to\nφ → 2 k0 ∫_0^d √(n^2 − β^2) dy = 2 k0 d √(n^2 − sin^2 i) = 2 (2π/λ) n d cos r,\nwhich is the standard thin-film result (n sin r = sin i), confirming correctness.\n\nNotes:\n- We ignored the phase changes upon reflection as requested.\n- Real propagation inside the film requires sin i < n_a to keep the square roots real at y = 0 (this is typically satisfied since n_a > 1 in usual films; otherwise one must ensure no evanescence).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\varphi \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\pi d}{\\lambda\\,(n_b - n_a)}\\;\\Bigg[\\, n_b\\sqrt{n_b^{2}-\\sin^{2} i}\\;-\\;n_a\\sqrt{n_a^{2}-\\sin^{2} i}\\;-\\;\\sin^{2} i\\;\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{n_b+\\sqrt{n_b^{2}-\\sin^{2} i}}{\\,n_a+\\sqrt{n_a^{2}-\\sin^{2} i}\\,}\\right) \\Bigg] } \\]"}

A test charge of mass m and charge −q (q>0) moves in the equatorial plane z=0 on a circular orbit of radius r0 ≫ R. We give it a small radial perturbation and ask for the difference between its small-amplitude radial oscillation period and its angular revolution period.\n\nOutline of the method\n- Compute the electrostatic potential of the n-ring system at points in the equatorial plane using a multipole expansion in spherical harmonics. Because r0 ≫ R, a far-field expansion is accurate.\n- The total potential is dominated by the monopole term with small corrections from higher multipoles. The configuration is symmetric under reflection across the equatorial plane; hence only even-l terms contribute to the axisymmetric (m=0) part. The m≠0 parts are suppressed by higher powers (R/r0)l and, for n≥3, first appear at l≥n, so they are negligible at leading order for r0 ≫ R. We therefore keep the axisymmetric part (m=0), which yields an effective central potential in the equatorial plane.\n- Using this effective central potential U(r) for the −q charge, we compute the orbital angular frequency Ω and the small radial oscillation (epicyclic) frequency ωr around the circular orbit at r0. The difference between the radial-oscillation period Tr and the revolution period Tφ is then found to leading order in (R/r0)^2.\n\n1) Axisymmetric multipole expansion of the potential on the equatorial plane\nLet V(r,θ,φ) be the electrostatic potential due to the n rings. The general exterior multipole expansion is\nV(r,θ,φ) = (1/(4π ε0)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ ∑_{m=-l}^l (4π/(2l+1)) q_{lm} Y_{lm}(θ,φ) / r^{l+1},\nwith multipole moments\nq_{lm} = ∫ ρ(r′) r′^l Y_{lm}^*(θ′,φ′) d^3r′,\nwhich for line charges become line integrals along the rings.\n\nFor the m=0 (axisymmetric) moments, only Y_{l0}(θ) = sqrt((2l+1)/(4π)) P_l(cos θ) are involved. Consider one ring. Parametrize the great-circle ring by the polar angle θ along a meridian (the ring consists of two meridians at azimuths α and α+π). The linear charge density is λ = Q/(2π R), the radial coordinate r′ = R is constant, and the line element along a meridian is dl = R dθ. The contribution of one ring to q_{l0} is\nq_{l0}^{(1)} = λ ∮ R^l Y_{l0}(θ) dl\n= λ R^l [2 ∫_0^π Y_{l0}(θ) (R dθ)]\n= 2 λ R^{l+1} ∫_0^π Y_{l0}(θ) dθ.\n\nUsing Y_{l0}(θ) = sqrt((2l+1)/(4π)) P_l(cos θ) and the known integral\n∫_0^π P_{2k}(cos θ) dθ = π [( (2k−1)!! / (2k)!! )]^2,  and ∫_0^π P_{2k+1}(cos θ) dθ = 0,\nwe get for l even (l=2k)\n∫_0^π Y_{l0}(θ) dθ = sqrt((2l+1)/(4π)) π a_l, with a_{2k} = [((2k−1)!!)/(2k)!!]^2,\nand zero for odd l.

For a central potential, the angular frequency Ω and small-amplitude radial frequency ωr about the circular orbit are\nΩ^2 = U′(r0)/(m r0),\nωr^2 = [ U″(r0) + 3 U′(r0)/r0 ] / m.\n\nSubstitute the expansions:\nΩ^2 = (K/m) [ 1/r0^3 + 3 c_2 R^2/r0^5 ],\nωr^2 = (K/m) [ 1/r0^3 − 3 c_2 R^2/r0^5 ].\n\nTherefore, to leading order in ε ≡ (R/r0)^2,\nωr^2/Ω^2 = [1 − 3 c_2 ε]/[1 + 3 c_2 ε] ≈ 1 − 6 c_2 ε,\nso\nωr ≈ Ω [ 1 − 3 c_2 ε ] = Ω [ 1 + (3/8) (R^2/r0^2) ],\nsince c_2 = −1/8.\n\nThus the radial oscillation is slightly faster than the azimuthal revolution (ωr > Ω), so its period is slightly shorter.\n\n3) Periods and their difference\nLet Tφ = 2π/Ω and Tr = 2π/ωr. From the above,\nTr/Tφ = Ω/ωr ≈ 1 − (3/8) (R^2/r0^2),\nhence\nTr − Tφ ≈ − (3/8) (R^2/r0^2) Tφ.\n\nThe (leading-order) revolution period is obtained from the monopole term:\nΩ0^2 = (K/m) 1/r0^3 = (n Q q)/(4π ε0 m r0^3),\nso\nTφ ≈ 2π/Ω0 = 2π sqrt( 4π ε0 m r0^3 / (n Q q) ).\n\nTherefore, to leading order in (R/r0)^2,\nTr − Tφ ≈ − (3/8) (R^2/r0^2) 2π sqrt( 4π ε0 m r0^3 / (n Q q) ).\n\nRemarks on symmetry and validity\n- The result above used the axisymmetric (m=0) part of the potential, which is the dominant correction at order (R/r0)^2. Non-axisymmetric terms (m ≠ 0), which would introduce small azimuthal torques, first appear at l ≥ n due to the n-fold rotational symmetry (so they are O((R/r0)^n) and negligible when n ≥ 3 and r0 ≫ R). Thus the effective central approximation is consistent at leading order for n ≥ 3. Even for small n, the leading fractional correction to Tr/Tφ from non-axisymmetric terms is higher order or averages out over many revolutions when r0 ≫ R.\n\nSummary of key results\n- Effective equatorial potential to O((R/r)^2):\nV(r,π/2) ≈ (n Q)/(4π ε0) [ 1/r − (1/8) R^2/r^3 ].\n- Frequencies:\nΩ^2 = (n Q q)/(4π ε0 m r0^3) [ 1 − (3/8)(R^2/r0^2) + … ],\nωr ≈ Ω [ 1 + (3/8)(R^2/r0^2) ].\n- Period difference:\nTr − Tφ ≈ − (3/8) (R^2/r0^2) Tφ,\nwith Tφ ≈ 2π sqrt( 4π ε0 m r0^3 / (n Q q) ).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&V(r,\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) \\simeq \\frac{nQ}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Big(\\frac{1}{r}-\\frac{1}{8}\\frac{R^2}{r^3}\\Big),\\\\[4pt]\n&\\Omega^2=\\frac{1}{mr_0}\\,U'(r_0)=\\frac{nQq}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m r_0^3}\\Big(1+\\frac{3}{8}\\frac{R^2}{r_0^2}\\Big),\\\\[4pt]\n&\\omega_r^2=\\frac{1}{m}\\Big(U''(r_0)+\\frac{3U'(r_0)}{r_0}\\Big)=\\frac{nQq}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m r_0^3}\\Big(1-\\frac{3}{8}\\frac{R^2}{r_0^2}\\Big),\\\\[6pt]\n&\\Rightarrow\\ \\ \\frac{\\omega_r}{\\Omega}\\simeq 1+\\frac{3}{8}\\frac{R^2}{r_0^2},\\quad\n\\frac{T_r-T_\\phi}{T_\\phi}\\simeq -\\,\\frac{3}{8}\\frac{R^2}{r_0^2},\\\\[6pt]\n&\\Rightarrow\\ \\ T_r-T_\\phi \\simeq -\\,\\frac{3}{8}\\,\\frac{R^2}{r_0^2}\\,T_\\phi,\\quad\nT_\\phi \\simeq 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m r_0^3}{nQq}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}

A and D are two equal masses m connected by a massless rope that passes over B and C.\n- Let r ≡ AB be the length of the rope segment from A to B, and let θ be the angle that AB makes with the vertical (θ = 0 when A is vertically under B). Let y ≡ CD be the length of the rope segment from D to C.\n- The rope length between B and C is fixed and the pulleys have negligible size, so the total rope length gives the constraint r + y = constant. Hence y = const − r and ẏ = − ṙ.\n\nThus, the dynamics can be expressed in terms of r(t) and θ(t).\n\n2) Energies and Lagrangian\n- Choose the level of the pulleys as zero potential energy height. The vertical positions (upward positive) are:\n  - A: z_A = − r cosθ,\n  - D: z_D = − y.\n  Therefore, the gravitational potential energy is\n  V = m g z_A + m g z_D = − m g (r cosθ + y).\n  Using y = const − r, this is\n  V = − m g (r cosθ + const − r) = m g r (1 − cosθ) + const',\n  and we may drop the irrelevant additive constant. Hence\n  V(r, θ) = m g r (1 − cosθ).\n\n- The kinetic energy has contributions from A and D:\n  - A: in polar-like coordinates about B, T_A = (1/2) m (ṙ^2 + r^2 θ̇^2).\n  - D: ẏ = − ṙ, so T_D = (1/2) m ẏ^2 = (1/2) m ṙ^2.\n  Therefore,\n  T = T_A + T_D = (1/2) m (2 ṙ^2 + r^2 θ̇^2).\n\n- The Lagrangian is\n  L = T − V = (1/2) m (2 ṙ^2 + r^2 θ̇^2) − m g r (1 − cosθ).\n\n3) Equations of motion\nFrom Euler–Lagrange:\n\n- For θ:\n  ∂L/∂θ = − m g r sinθ,  ∂L/∂θ̇ = m r^2 θ̇\n  ⇒ d/dt (m r^2 θ̇) + m g r sinθ = 0\n  ⇒ θ̈ + 2 (ṙ/r) θ̇ + (g/r) sinθ = 0.\n\n- For r:\n  ∂L/∂r = m r θ̇^2 − m g (1 − cosθ),  ∂L/∂ṙ = 2 m ṙ\n  ⇒ d/dt (2 m ṙ) − (m r θ̇^2 − m g (1 − cosθ)) = 0\n  ⇒ 2 r̈ − r θ̇^2 + g (1 − cosθ) = 0.\n\nThese are the equations of the “swinging Atwood machine” with equal masses and negligible pulley size.\n\n4) Small-angle and slow-variation regime\nThe problem states: the initial angle θ0 is small, and A descends very slowly so that AB can be treated as nearly constant over one oscillation. This means:\n- Small-angle approximation: sinθ ≈ θ, cosθ ≈ 1 − θ^2/2.\n- The r-equation, averaged over a fast oscillation, shows the slow drift of r:\n\n  Using θ(t) ≈ Θ cos(ω t) with ω ≈ √(g/r),\n  ⟨θ^2⟩ = Θ^2/2,  ⟨θ̇^2⟩ = (Θ^2/2) ω^2 = (Θ^2/2) (g/r).\n\n  Averaging 2 r̈ − r θ̇^2 + g (1 − cosθ) = 0 gives\n  2 ⟨r̈⟩ − r ⟨θ̇^2⟩ + g ⟨1 − cosθ⟩ = 0\n  ⇒ 2 ⟨r̈⟩ − r (Θ^2/2) (g/r) + g (Θ^2/2) = 0\n  ⇒ 2 ⟨r̈⟩ ≈ 0.\n\nThus, to leading order, r varies only on a much longer timescale than the θ–oscillation; this justifies the adiabatic treatment.\n\nAt any instant, with r treated as frozen, the θ-dynamics is that of a simple pendulum of length r with small-angle frequency\n  ω(r) = √(g/r).\n\nThe θ-equation shows an extra “Hubble-like” term 2 (ṙ/r) θ̇, which acts as a weak damping when r increases. The envelope amplitude Θ(t) therefore changes slowly as r(t) drifts.\n\n5) Adiabatic invariant and amplitude scaling\nFor a harmonic oscillator with slowly varying parameters, the action (adiabatic invariant)\n  J_θ = E_θ / ω\nis (approximately) conserved.\n\nHere, for small θ at fixed r:\n- Effective angular mass: M_eff = m r^2,\n- Effective angular stiffness: K = m g r,\n- Frequency: ω = √(K/M_eff) = √(g/r).\n- Angular oscillation energy (amplitude Θ):\n  E_θ = (1/2) K Θ^2 = (1/2) m g r Θ^2.\n\nTherefore,\n  J_θ = E_θ / ω = [(1/2) m g r Θ^2] / √(g/r)\n      = (1/2) m Θ^2 √g r^{3/2}.\n\nSince J_θ is adiabatically invariant as r changes slowly due to the coupling with the other mass, we have\n  Θ^2 r^{3/2} = const.\n\nLet the initial length be r = x0 with amplitude Θ = θ0. When the length is r = x, the amplitude is Θ(x). Hence\n  θ0^2 x0^{3/2} = Θ(x)^2 x^{3/2}\n  ⇒ Θ(x) = θ0 (x0 / x)^{3/4}.\n\nThis is the standard −3/4 power law for the amplitude envelope of a pendulum whose length changes slowly.\n\nAssumptions used:\n- Small-angle oscillations (θ0 ≪ 1 and Θ(x) ≪ 1).\n- Slow variation of r compared to the oscillation period (verified via averaging above).\n- Massless rope and pulleys without friction; both masses equal m.\n\nResult interpretation:\n- If AB increases slowly from x0 to x > x0 (A descends), the angular amplitude decreases according to Θ ∝ x^{−3/4}.\n- If AB decreases, amplitude increases by the same law, within the small-angle regime.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,\\Theta(x)\\;\\approx\\;\\theta_{0}\\left(\\dfrac{x_{0}}{x}\\right)^{3/4}\\,} \\]"}

For an elastic string with modulus (elastic coefficient) k and natural length a, the tension when stretched by an extension x ≥ 0 is\n  T = (k/a) x.\n- Initially, the particle is held at distance a + b from O (so the extension is x = b) and released from rest.\n\nWe are asked for the time taken for the particle to return to its original release position (distance a + b from O).\n\nKinematics variable\n- Let s(t) be the distance from O to the particle.\n- Let x(t) = s(t) − a be the extension of the string (so x ≥ 0 means taut; x = 0 means just taut; x < 0 would be slack, in which case the string exerts no force).\n\nStage I: Motion while the string is taut (simple harmonic motion)\n- Initially x(0) = b, and the particle is released from rest, so x′(0) = 0.\n- While 0 < x(t) ≤ b (i.e., from release until the string just reaches natural length), the equation of motion is\n  m x″ = −(k/a) x.\n- This is SHM with angular frequency\n  ω = sqrt(k/(m a)).\n- The solution satisfying x(0) = b, x′(0) = 0 is\n  x(t) = b cos(ω t),    v(t) = x′(t) = −b ω sin(ω t).\n- The string becomes just slack (x = 0) for the first time when cos(ω t1) = 0, i.e.,\n  t1 = (π/2) / ω = (π/2) sqrt(m a / k).\n- The speed at that instant is\n  v1 = |v(t1)| = b ω = b sqrt(k/(m a)).\n  (Alternatively, by energy: 0.5 m v1^2 = ∫_0^b (k/a) x dx = (k/(2a)) b^2 ⇒ v1 as above.)\n\nStage II: Free motion (string slack) from s = a to the fixed point s = 0\n- For x ≤ 0 (distance s ≤ a), the string exerts no force; the particle moves with constant velocity v1 toward O.\n- Distance to cover: a.\n- Time for this leg:\n  t2 = a / v1 = a / (b ω) = (a/b) sqrt(m a / k).\n\nCollision at the fixed point and reversal\n- On reaching the fixed point O, the particle cannot pass through; the end is fixed. In the idealized model (smooth, rigid), we take the collision to reverse the velocity instantaneously with no loss of speed (perfectly elastic reversal at a fixed point).

From there, the same SHM governs the motion back to x = b (the release position).

If instead the given k were a spring constant (force per unit extension) for a spring that can also push in compression, the motion would be pure SHM throughout with angular frequency ω = sqrt(k/m), and the time to return to the release position would simply be T = 2π/ω = 2π sqrt(m/k).

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved.

I follow the hints and make every step explicit.\n\n1) Geometry and kinematics of the circular binary\n\nLet M_S and M_J be the masses of the two stars (Saka and Juipte), and let M ≡ M_S + M_J. They move on circular orbits of radii R_S and R_J about their common center of mass with angular frequency Ω. Denote the binary separation by R0 ≡ R_S + R_J.\n\n- Center-of-mass condition: M_S R_S = M_J R_J.\n- Force balance (centripetal = gravitational):\n  - For S: M_S Ω^2 R_S = G M_S M_J / R0^2 ⇒ Ω^2 R_S = G M_J / R0^2.\n  - For J: M_J Ω^2 R_J = G M_S M_J / R0^2 ⇒ Ω^2 R_J = G M_S / R0^2.\n\nAdding the two equations gives Kepler’s third law for the binary:\nΩ^2 R0 = G M / R0^2 ⇒ Ω^2 = G M / R0^3 ⇒ R0 = (G M / Ω^2)^{1/3}.\n\nThe individual radii about the COM are then\nR_S = (M_J / M) R0,  R_J = (M_S / M) R0.\n\n2) Time-averaged effective potential seen by a distant planet (r ≫ R0)\n\nThe instantaneous potential energy of a planet of mass m at position r (in the binary plane) is\nV(r, t) = − G m [ M_S / |r − r_S(t)| + M_J / |r − r_J(t)| ].\n\nGiven r ≫ R0 and that the planet’s position barely changes over one binary period (the binary rotates with angular frequency Ω), we expand in multipoles and average over the fast binary rotation. For r' ≡ |r_i| ≪ r, the expansion is\n1/|r − r'| = 1/r + (r' ⋅ r)/r^3 + (r'^2/r^3) (3 cos^2 γ − 1)/2 + O(r'^3),\nwhere γ is the angle between r' and r.\n\n- The monopole term sums to − G m M / r.\n- The dipole term vanishes because the center of mass is at the origin, ∑ M_i r_i = 0.\n- The leading correction is the quadrupole l = 2 term. Time-averaging over the binary phase in the coplanar case yields ⟨P2(cos γ)⟩ = ⟨(3 cos^2 γ − 1)/2⟩ = 1/4.\n\nTherefore the leading correction (after the time average) is\nδV(r) = − G m (1/r^3) × (1/4) ∑_i M_i r_i^2\n       = − G m (1/4) (M_S R_S^2 + M_J R_J^2) 1/r^3.\n\nUsing M_S R_S^2 + M_J R_J^2 = (M_S M_J / M) R0^2 (a standard identity for two-body COM)\nwe finally get the time-averaged effective potential\nV_eff(r) = V_0(r) + δV(r)\n         = − G m M / r − G m (1/4) (M_S M_J / M) R0^2 1/r^3.\n\nEquivalently, since Ω^2 = G M / R0^3,\nR0^2 = (G M / Ω^2)^{2/3}\nand one may write δV in terms of Ω if desired.\n\n3) Zeroth-order (Kepler) motion, LRL vector, and its magnitude\n\nDefine the gravitational parameter μ ≡ G M and the specific angular momentum h ≡ L/m. For the unperturbed potential V_0 = − G m M / r = − m μ / r, the orbit is the Kepler conic\nr(θ) = p / (1 + e cos θ),  with  p = h^2 / μ = L^2 / (m^2 G M).\n\nThe Laplace–Runge–Lenz (LRL) vector is (as given)\nB⃗ = v⃗ × L⃗ − G (M_J + M_S) m r̂ = v⃗ × L⃗ − μ m r̂.\n\nIn the pure Kepler problem (V = V_0) it is conserved: B⃗_0 = B⃗ = const. Its magnitude is related to the eccentricity e by |B⃗_0| = m μ e. In terms of the energy E and angular momentum L one has the identity\n|B⃗_0|^2 = m^2 μ^2 + 2 m E L^2  ⇒  |B⃗_0| = sqrt( m^2 μ^2 + 2 m E L^2 ),\nand e = |B⃗_0| / (m μ) = sqrt(1 + 2 E L^2 / (m μ^2)).\n\n4) Precession from the averaged quadrupole correction δV = − C / r^3\n\nWith\nC ≡ G m (1/4) (M_S M_J / M) R0^2,\nthe correction is δV = − C / r^3. It is central and time-averaged (axisymmetric), so L⃗ is still conserved, but the LRL vector precesses.\n\nA convenient way to compute the apsidal precession is via Binet’s equation for u(θ) ≡ 1/r using specific quantities (per unit mass). Let v(r) ≡ V(r)/m be the specific potential:\nv(r) = − μ / r − C_s / r^3,  where C_s ≡ C/m = G (1/4) (M_S M_J / M) R0^2.\n\nThe radial acceleration a_r = − d v/dr gives\na_r = − μ u^2 − 3 C_s u^4.\n\nBinet’s equation in specific form is\nu'' + u = − a_r / (h^2 u^2) = μ/h^2 + (3 C_s / h^2) u^2.\n\nTreat the u^2 term as a small perturbation. Write\nu'' + u = μ/h^2 + ε u^2,  with  ε ≡ 3 C_s / h^2.\n\nTo first order in ε, the secular (per orbit) advance of the periapsis is obtained by eliminating the resonance with the cos θ term in u^2; the standard perturbative calculation (solve u_1'' + u_1 = ε u_0^2 with u_0 = (1/p)(1 + e cos θ), identify the resonant A cos θ term with amplitude A = 2 e ε / p^2, and translate the secular piece into a phase drift) gives the periapsis precession per orbit\nΔα = 2 π ε / p\n    = 2 π (3 C_s / h^2) / (h^2 / μ)\n    = 6 π C_s μ / h^4.\n\nRe-expressing C_s and h in the original variables:\n- C_s = C/m = G (1/4) (M_S M_J / M) R0^2,\n- μ = G M,\n- h = L / m.\n\nTherefore\nΔα = 6 π [ G (1/4) (M_S M_J / M) R0^2 ] [ G M ] / (L^4 / m^4)\n    = (3 π / 2) G^2 M_S M_J R0^2 m^4 / L^4.\n\nUsing R0 = (G M / Ω^2)^{1/3} one obtains the requested expression in terms of M_J, M_S, G, Ω, m, L:\nΔα = (3 π / 2) G^2 M_S M_J (G M / Ω^2)^{2/3} m^4 / L^4,\nwith M = M_S + M_J.\n\nEquivalently, collecting powers of G:\nΔα = (3 π / 2) m^4 G^{8/3} M_S M_J (M_S + M_J)^{2/3} / ( L^4 Ω^{4/3} ).\n\nRemarks:\n- The averaging over the binary orbital phase (valid because R0 ≪ r and the planet barely moves over one binary period) renders the perturbation central and axisymmetric, ensuring that L is conserved while the LRL vector precesses.\n- The precession to leading order is independent of the eccentricity e (as is also the case for the GR 1/r^3-type correction).\n- The sign of δV (negative) implies a prograde precession (Δα > 0).\n\nSummary of intermediate results that were asked for:\n- Binary separation and radii: R0 = (G (M_S + M_J)/Ω^2)^{1/3}, R_S = (M_J/M) R0, R_J = (M_S/M) R0.\n- Time-averaged effective potential: V_eff(r) = − G m (M_S + M_J)/r − G m (M_S M_J / (4 (M_S + M_J))) R0^2 / r^3.\n- Zeroth-order orbit: r(θ) = p/(1 + e cos θ), with p = L^2/(m^2 G (M_S + M_J)), and |B⃗_0| = sqrt(m^2 (G (M_S + M_J))^2 + 2 m E L^2).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\Delta \\alpha \\;=\\; \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\,\\frac{G^2\\,M_S M_J\\,R_0^2\\,m^{4}}{L^{4}}\n\\;=\\;\n\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\,\\frac{m^{4}\\,G^{8/3}\\,M_S M_J\\,(M_S + M_J)^{2/3}}{L^{4}\\,\\Omega^{4/3}}\n\\quad\\text{(per planetary orbit)}\n}\n\\]"}

Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical.

Hence only rotation matters.\n- The sphere’s rotation about ŷ changes the orientations of loops A and B relative to B and induces EMFs and currents in those loops; loop C, whose normal is along ŷ, sees zero flux at all times and induces no current.\n- The induced magnetic torques oppose the rotation (Lenz’s law), and because contact is rough, the no-slip constraint v = R ω is maintained. Static friction supplies the necessary horizontal force and torque but does no work. All mechanical energy lost goes to Joule heating in the wires.\n\nGeometry and induced EMFs\nLet θ(t) be the rotation angle about ŷ, so ω = dθ/dt. The loop normals evolve as:\n- n_A(t) = R_y(θ) ẑ = (sinθ, 0, cosθ)\n- n_B(t) = R_y(θ) x̂ = (cosθ, 0, -sinθ)\n- n_C(t) = ŷ (constant)\n\nMagnetic fluxes Φ_j = B A (n_j · ẑ), with A = π R^2:\n- Φ_A = B A cosθ\n- Φ_B = - B A sinθ\n- Φ_C = 0\n\nEMFs ε_j = - dΦ_j/dt:\n- ε_A = - d/dt (B A cosθ) = B A ω sinθ\n- ε_B = - d/dt (- B A sinθ) = B A ω cosθ\n- ε_C = 0\n\nEach loop has resistance R_loop = (2 π R) λ. Assuming quasi-static conditions and negligible self-inductance:\n- i_A = ε_A / R_loop = (B A ω sinθ)/(2 π R λ)\n- i_B = ε_B / R_loop = (B A ω cosθ)/(2 π R λ)\n- i_C = 0\n\nMagnetic torque\nThe magnetic torque on loop j is τ_j = μ_j × B, where μ_j = i_j A n_j is the magnetic dipole moment.

Let θ be the material (body-fixed) polar angle along the ring.\n\n1) Modes and degeneracy at Ω = 0\n\nFor a nonrotating ring, each in-plane modal family of order m ≥ 2 consists of a pair of degenerate modes with angular dependence cos(mθ) and sin(mθ), equivalently the pair of counter-propagating traveling waves e^{± i m θ}. Denote by ω0(m) the natural frequency of that modal family at Ω = 0. For a slender circular ring vibrating in its own plane in flexure, one convenient formula (not essential for what follows) is\nω0^2(m) = (EI/(ρ A R^4)) m^2 (m^2 − 1)^2,\nso that\nω0(m) = [m (m^2 − 1)/R^2] sqrt(EI/(ρ A)).\nAny Ω ≪ ω0 assumption makes the following results insensitive to the detailed stiffness formula; we will keep ω0(m) general and only use that it is the same for the ±m traveling waves at Ω = 0.\n\n2) What rotation does to the traveling-wave frequencies\n\nLet the ring rotate rigidly about its normal at angular velocity Ω (the center is stationary in the frame rotating with Ω, and the ring’s normal is parallel to Ω). We work to first order in Ω and neglect O(Ω^2) centrifugal stiffening/softening; those terms shift both frequencies equally and do not affect the splitting at O(Ω).\n\nThere is a very general and compact way to see the effect of rotation on a wave with azimuthal order m: passing to the uniformly rotating frame subtracts Ω times the z-component of angular momentum from the Hamiltonian, i.e. H' = H − Ω L_z. For a traveling wave with angular dependence e^{i m θ} and frequency ω0 at Ω = 0, the ratio of angular momentum to energy is L_z/E = m/ω0 (a standard result for waves on a circle: the action is J = E/ω0 and L_z = m J). Therefore the mode frequency in the rotating frame shifts to\nω±(Ω) = ω0(m) ∓ m Ω + O(Ω^2),\nwhere the upper/lower sign corresponds to the wave with azimuthal phase e^{± i m θ}, i.e. counterclockwise/clockwise if θ increases CCW. \n\nThe same result can be obtained kinematically. A traveling wave written in the rotating coordinates as exp[i(m θ − ω_rot t)] corresponds in inertial coordinates ϑ = θ + Ω t to exp[i(m ϑ − (ω_rot + m Ω) t)]. To leading order in Ω (neglecting Ω^2 changes to the structure), the inertial eigenfrequency remains ω0(m); hence ω_rot = ω0 − m Ω for the +m component, and by symmetry ω_rot = ω0 + m Ω for the −m component.\n\nThus the two counter-propagating waves that formed the degenerate pair at Ω = 0 are split by\nωccw − ωcw = 2 m Ω + O(Ω^2).\n\n3) Standing waves and precession of antinodes\n\nA standing wave of order m is formed by superposing equal-amplitude counter-propagating traveling waves. Let us choose equal amplitudes and write, in the rotating frame,\nu(θ, t) = A cos(m θ − ωcw t) + A cos(m θ + ωccw t),\nwith ωcw = ω0(m) + m Ω and ωccw = ω0(m) − m Ω as above (sign convention: positive θ same as Ω).\n\nUse the identity cos X + cos Y = 2 cos[(X + Y)/2] cos[(X − Y)/2] to obtain\nu(θ, t) = 2 A cos[m θ − Δ t] cos[ω0(m) t] + O(Ω^2),\nwhere\nΔ = (ωccw − ωcw)/2 = − m Ω.\nThe slowly varying factor cos[m θ − Δ t] controls the spatial location of the antinodes. Its maxima satisfy m θ − Δ t = constant, so\nθmax(t) = θmax(0) + (Δ/m) t = θmax(0) − Ω t.\nTherefore, in the rotating frame the antinode pattern precesses at angular velocity\nδω = dθmax/dt = Δ/m = − Ω\nto first order in Ω. The negative sign (with the positive sense defined to be the same as Ω) means the antinodes drift opposite to the ring’s spin in the rotating frame. Equivalently, the standing-wave pattern is essentially stationary in the inertial frame (to O(Ω)), while the ring rotates under it.\n\n4) Remarks on dependence on material parameters\n\n- The precession rate δω is independent of R, r, ρ, E, and of the detailed value of ω0(m), provided Ω ≪ ω0(m). Those parameters determine ω0(m) and the fast carrier oscillation cos[ω0(m) t], but they drop out of the O(Ω) precession.\n- O(Ω^2) centrifugal effects (hoop tension and stiffness changes) shift both ωcw and ωccw by the same amount and thus do not affect δω at first order.\n\nSummary:\n- Traveling waves of order m in the rotating frame have ω± = ω0(m) ∓ m Ω + O(Ω^2).\n- A standing wave built from them has antinodes that precess in the rotating frame at δω = − Ω to leading order, independent of m and of material properties.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\delta\\omega \\;=\\; -\\,\\Omega \\quad\\text{(to first order in }\\Omega/\\omega_0\\text{)}}\n\\]"}

Substitute into (5):\n18/k = −[1 − 2(1 + 6/k)] = −[1 − 2 − 12/k] = −[−1 − 12/k] = 1 + 12/k.\nTherefore 18/k = 1 + 12/k ⇒ 6/k = 1 ⇒ k = 6.\n\nThus the proportionality in c_p is fixed by consistency: c_p = 6 (p v / T).\n\n4) Solve for f(p) and the equation of state\nWith k = 6, (2) gives\np f′ + [1 + 6/6] f = p f′ + 2 f = 0 ⇒ f′/f = −2/p,\nso f(p) = C p^−2, with C a positive constant (substance-dependent).\nTherefore the equation of state is\nv(T,p) = C T^3 p^−2  ⇔  p^2 v = C T^3.        (6)\n\n5) Entropy as a state function\nUse (1) with k = 6 and f = C p^−2:\ndS = 6 p T (C p^−2) dT − 3 T^2 (C p^−2) dp = 6 C T p^−1 dT − 3 C T^2 p^−2 dp.\nIntegrate at fixed p:\nS(T,p) = ∫ 6 C T p^−1 dT + const = 3 C T^2 / p + const.        (7)\n\nEliminate C via (6): C = p^2 v / T^3. Insert into (7):\nS(T,p) = 3 (p^2 v / T^3) (T^2 / p) + const = 3 (p v / T) + const.        (8)\n\nThus, up to an additive constant, the molar entropy is S = 3 (p v / T).\n\n6) Entropy change between A and D\nThe additive constant cancels in differences, so\nS_D − S_A = 3 (p_D v_D / T_D) − 3 (p_A v_A / T_A).\n\nIf T_D is not explicitly given, determine it from the equation of state (6), fixing C from state A:\nC = (p_A^2 v_A) / T_A^3 ⇒ T_D = T_A [(p_D^2 v_D) / (p_A^2 v_A)]^{1/3}.\nThen\np_D v_D / T_D = (p_A^{2/3} v_A^{1/3} / T_A) p_D^{1/3} v_D^{2/3},\nso an equivalent expression using only the provided data is\nS_D − S_A = (3 / T_A) [ p_A^{2/3} v_A^{1/3} p_D^{1/3} v_D^{2/3} − p_A v_A ].\n\nBoth forms are identical (the second simply eliminates T_D using the EOS).\n\nCheck of consistency:\n- α = 3/T holds since v ∝ T^3 at fixed p.\n- c_p = 6 p v / T by construction.\n- Isentropes (S = const ⇒ p v / T = const) combine with EOS p^2 v ∝ T^3 to give p v^2 = const, as required:\np v / T ∝ p^{1/3} v^{2/3} ⇒ const ⇒ p v^2 ∝ const^3.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,S_D - S_A \\;=\\; 3\\!\\left(\\frac{p_D v_D}{T_D} - \\frac{p_A v_A}{T_A}\\right)\n\\;=\\; \\frac{3}{T_A}\\!\\left(p_A^{2/3} v_A^{1/3}\\, p_D^{1/3} v_D^{2/3} - p_A v_A\\right)\\,}\n\\]"}

Because the force is central (F = −k r), the torque about the origin vanishes. For a variable-mass body accreting dust that is initially at rest in the lab, the momentum balance is d(γ m v)/dt = Fext (there is no u dm/dt term here since the dust’s momentum before capture is zero in this frame). Therefore the angular momentum L = r × (γ m v) is conserved (r × Fext = 0).\n\n1) Relativistic uniform circular motion relations\n\nFor uniform circular motion of radius R, the (transverse) relativistic equation is\nk R = γ m v^2 / R.\n\nThe (conserved) angular momentum magnitude is\nL = γ m R v.\n\nEliminating v between these two equations gives\nL^2 = k γ m R^4.\n\nTherefore the combination\nC := m γ R^4 = L^2 / k\nis a constant of motion.

The initial speed parameter β0 is determined by the circular-balance condition at R0:\nγ0 β0^2 = k R0^2 / (m0 c^2).\nEquivalently, with λ0 := k R0^2 / (m0 c^2), one may solve for β0^2 explicitly:\nβ0^2 = [ −λ0^2 + λ0 sqrt(λ0^2 + 4) ] / 2,\nand then γ0 = 1 / sqrt(1 − β0^2).\n\nUsing C = m γ R^4, the orbital speed on the (slowly shrinking) circular orbit is\nv(R) = sqrt(k/C) R^3,\nwhich implies\nβ(R)^2 = v(R)^2 / c^2 = (k R^6) / (C c^2),  and  γ(R) = 1 / sqrt(1 − β(R)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 − k R^6/(C c^2)).\n\n2) Mass accretion and radius evolution\n\nThe rest mass accretion rate in the lab frame is\ndm/dt = ρ A v(R) = ρ A sqrt(k/C) R^3.\n\nBecause m depends on R via the constant C:\nm(R) = C / (γ(R) R^4),\nwe can differentiate m with respect to R to obtain dm/dR and then form dR/dt = (dm/dt)/(dm/dR).

Their centers form an equilateral triangle of side 2R in the horizontal plane.\n- A light rope is wrapped around them at the height of their centers (so the rope lies in that plane).\n- A fourth identical sphere is placed on top, touching all three bottom spheres. Its center lies above the centroid of the base triangle. The four centers form a regular tetrahedron of side 2R.\n- All contacts are smooth, so contact forces act along the normals (lines joining centers). The ground is smooth, so it provides vertical reaction only (no horizontal reaction).\n\nGoal: Find the rope tension T.\n\n1) Geometry of the contact between top and bottom spheres\nThe centers form a regular tetrahedron of side a = 2R. The line of contact between the top center and any bottom center makes an angle α with the vertical.\n\nYou can compute sin α and cos α from tetrahedron geometry. The horizontal projection from a bottom center to the centroid of the base is\n- centroid distance d = a/√3 = 2R/√3,\nand the slant edge length is a = 2R. Hence:\n- sin α = (horizontal offset)/(edge length) = (2R/√3)/(2R) = 1/√3,\n- cos α = √(1 − sin^2 α) = √(1 − 1/3) = √(2/3).\n\n2) Normal force between the top sphere and one bottom sphere\nLet N be the magnitude of the normal force at one top–bottom contact. For the top sphere in vertical equilibrium, the upward components of the three contact forces balance its weight:\n3 N cos α = P\n=> N = P / (3 cos α) = P / (3 · √(2/3)) = P / (√6).\n\nThus the horizontal (radial) component of that force on a bottom sphere is\nN_h = N sin α = (P / √6) · (1/√3) = P / √18 = P / (3√2).\n\nThis horizontal component on each bottom sphere points outward, away from the centroid of the triangle.\n\n3) What forces hold a bottom sphere in horizontal equilibrium?\nConsider any one bottom sphere. The horizontal forces acting on it are:\n- Outward (away from the triangle centroid): the horizontal component N_h = N sin α from the top sphere.\n- Forces from the other two bottom spheres at the side contacts (along lines joining centers). Key observation: The top sphere tries to push the bottom spheres apart, tending to open the gaps between them. Smooth contacts cannot pull; therefore the bottom–bottom contact forces cannot be tensile. In fact, they vanish in equilibrium (they would separate if not for the rope). Hence the compressive normal at each bottom–bottom contact is S = 0.\n- Inward (toward the centroid): the resultant of the two rope tensions acting tangentially on that sphere.\n\n4) Resultant force from the rope on one bottom sphere\nIn plan view at the center height, the rope touches each sphere along an outer arc between two straight tangent segments that go between neighboring spheres. For two equal tangent circles, the straight segment between them is parallel to the line joining their centers. Therefore, at a given bottom sphere, the two rope forces are along directions parallel to the lines from that sphere’s center to the other two centers, which are separated by 60 degrees.\n\nThus the two rope tension vectors on one sphere have magnitude T each and are separated by 60°. Their vector sum (net force from the rope on that sphere) has magnitude\n|F_rope| = 2 T cos(60°/2) = 2 T cos 30° = 2 T (√3/2) = √3 T,\nand is directed toward the centroid of the triangle (inward).\n\n5) Horizontal equilibrium of one bottom sphere\nBalance radial (horizontal) forces along the line joining the bottom sphere’s center to the centroid:\ninward rope resultant = outward push from top sphere + outward push from neighbors.\n\nBut as argued, the bottom–bottom contact forces vanish (S = 0).

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/653", "questions": "A massless insulating string of length $\\alpha$ is fixed at one end, with a conductor ring of mass $m$ and radius $r$ ($r \\ll \\alpha$) suspended on the other end, forming a simple pendulum. Initially, the pendulum string is vertical, and the ring is just inside a sector of a uniform magnetic field. The center of the sector is at the suspension point, with its edges just tangent to the ring. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the ring and directed inward, with a magnetic flux density of $B$. If the ring is given an initial horizontal velocity (perpendicular to the magnetic field) with a magnitude of $v$, what is the minimum initial velocity $v_{0}$ required for the pendulum string to reach the horizontal direction? The gravitational acceleration is $g$, the magnetic field is sufficiently strong, and the torque due to the Ampere force is much greater than the torque due to gravity when the ring moves within the magnetic field. The ring is a superconducting ring with a self-inductance coefficient $L$.", "solutions": "If the ring is a superconducting ring, when it moves in a magnetic field, due to the properties of the superconductor, the magnetic flux in the ring remains unchanged, i.e.:  $$ L I + B S = B \\cdot \\pi r^2 $$  Thus, the current in the ring is:  $$ \\begin{array}{l}{I = \\displaystyle\\frac{B}{L}(\\pi r^{2} - S)}\\ = \\displaystyle\\frac{B}{L}\\left\\{r^{2}\\arcsin\\left[\\frac{a(\\theta_{0}-\\theta)}{r}\\right] - \\sqrt{2r a\\theta-a^{2}\\theta^{2}} \\cdot a(\\theta_{0}-\\theta)\\right\\}\\end{array} $$  $$ \\phi = \\operatorname{arccos}\\left[\\frac{a(\\theta_{0}-\\theta)}{r}\\right] $$  We have:  $$ \\cos\\phi = \\frac{a(\\theta_{0}-\\theta)}{r}, \\sin\\phi = \\sqrt{1-\\cos^{2}\\phi} = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{a^{2}(\\theta_{0}-\\theta)^{2}}{r^{2}}} $$  Thus:  $$ I = \\frac{B}{L}(r^{2}\\phi - r^{2}\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi), l = 2r\\sin\\phi $$  The torque about the suspension point due to the Ampère force acting on the part of the ring within the magnetic field is approximately:  $$ \\tau = I B l a = \\frac{2B^{2}r a}{L}(r^{2}\\phi - r^{2}\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi)\\sin\\phi $$  The dynamic equation of the ring is:  $$ m a^{2}\\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = -\\frac{2B^{2}r a}{L}(r^{2}\\phi - r^{2}\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi)\\sin\\phi $$  Since $\\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = \\omega\\frac{d\\omega}{d\\theta}$, we have:  $$ d\\theta = \\frac{r}{a} \\sin (\\phi) d\\phi $$  Thus:  Integrating both sides, given that initially when $\\theta = 0$, $\\phi = 0$, and $\\omega \\approx \\frac{v_{0}}{a}$, we have:  $$ m a^{2}\\int_{\\frac{v_{0}}{a}}^{\\omega}\\omega d\\omega = -\\frac{2B^{2}r^{4}}{L}\\int_{0}^{\\phi}\\left(\\phi - \\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi\\right)\\sin^{2}\\phi d\\phi $$  We obtain:  $$ \\frac{1}{2}m a^{2}\\left(\\omega^{2}-\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right) = -\\frac{B^{2}r^{4}}{2L}\\left[\\phi^{2} - \\phi\\sin2\\phi - \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos2\\phi - 1) - \\sin^{4}\\phi\\right] $$  Thus:  $$ \\omega^{2} = \\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}} - \\frac{B^{2}r^{4}}{m a^{2}L}\\left[\\phi^{2} - \\phi\\sin2\\phi - \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos2\\phi - 1) - \\sin^{4}\\phi\\right] $$  When the ring has just completely left the magnetic field area, $\\theta = 2\\theta_{0}$, corresponding to $\\phi = \\pi$, substituting into the above equation, we get:  $$ \\omega_{2}^{2} = \\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}} - \\frac{\\pi^{2}B^{2}r^{4}}{m a^{2}L} $$  To make the pendulum reach the horizontal direction, it should satisfy:  $$ v_{0} = \\sqrt{2g a + \\frac{\\pi^{2}B^{2}r^{4}}{m L}} $$", "final_answers": "$$\\sqrt{2g a+\\frac{\\pi^2 B^2 r^4}{m L}}$$", "improved_solutions": "Given data and geometry\n- Length of pendulum (string): α\n- Ring: mass m, radius r (r ≪ α), self-inductance L, superconducting\n- B-field: uniform of magnitude B, perpendicular to the plane of motion (and of the ring), confined to a sector whose vertex is at the pivot. The sector’s two radial edges are tangent to the ring when the string is vertical (downward).\n- Initially: pendulum vertical; ring fully inside the sector; no current in the superconducting ring (i = 0).\n- The ring is given an initial horizontal (tangential) speed v0 at the bottom.\n- Assumption: While any portion of the ring is in the magnetic field sector, the torque due to Ampère forces is much larger than gravity, so we may neglect gravitational effects during that short interval. Outside the field, motion is purely under gravity.\n\nKey geometric fact\n- Let δ be the half-angle between the two sector edges as seen from the pivot. Because the edges are tangent to the ring at distance α, sin δ = r/α, so δ ≈ r/α (since r ≪ α). If the pendulum deflects by an angle φ from the initial vertical direction, then:\n  - For |φ| ≤ 2δ, part of the ring area still lies within the sector (partial overlap).\n  - For |φ| ≥ 2δ, the ring has completely left the sector and is entirely outside the B-field.\n- Initially (φ = 0), the ring’s disk (area A = π r^2) lies entirely within the sector. Hence the initial external flux through the ring is\n  Φ_ext(0) = B A = B π r^2.\n\nSuperconducting flux conservation and magnetic energy\n- For a superconducting ring, the total linked flux\n  Φ_link = Φ_ext(φ) + L i(φ)\n  is conserved (no resistance, no decay), where i is the induced current and L is the self-inductance.\n- Initially, i(0) = 0, so Φ_link = Φ_ext(0) = Φ0 with Φ0 := B π r^2.\n- As the ring moves out of the sector, Φ_ext(φ) decreases from Φ0 to 0 by the time the ring has fully exited the sector (at |φ| = 2δ). To keep Φ_link constant, a current builds up to i_f such that\n  L i_f = Φ_link − Φ_ext = Φ0 − 0 = Φ0,\n  i_f = Φ0/L = (B π r^2)/L.\n- The magnetic energy stored in the superconducting ring at that instant (after it has left the field) is\n  U_B = (1/2) L i_f^2 = (1/2) L (Φ0/L)^2 = Φ0^2/(2L) = (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(2L).\n\nEnergy accounting\n- Let the initial kinetic energy at the bottom be K0 = (1/2) m v0^2.\n- While the ring is within the sector (0 ≤ |φ| ≤ 2δ), Ampère forces do work that converts part of the kinetic energy into magnetic energy U_B. Because the B-field torque ≫ gravity torque in this interval and δ ~ r/α ≪ 1, the change in gravitational potential energy up to φ = 2δ is negligible compared with the magnetic work (and in any case is small of order mg α δ^2 ≈ m g r^2/α).\n- Hence, just after the ring completely exits the sector, the kinetic energy is approximately\n  K1 = K0 − U_B = (1/2) m v0^2 − (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(2L).\n- From that point on (|φ| ≥ 2δ), there is no magnetic field acting on the ring. The motion is then that of a simple pendulum under gravity alone. To reach the horizontal position (φ = 90°) with zero speed at the top, the ring’s center must gain gravitational potential energy ΔU_g = m g α (since height gain is α[1 − cos 90°] = α).\n- Therefore, the minimal speed condition is\n  K1 = m g α,\n  i.e.,\n  (1/2) m v0^2 − (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(2L) = m g α.\n\nSolving for v0,min\n- Rearranging,\n  (1/2) m v0,min^2 = m g α + (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(2L),\n  v0,min^2 = 2 g α + (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(L m),\n  v0,min = sqrt(2 g α + (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(L m)).\n\nRemarks on assumptions and corrections\n- The correction due to gravitational potential change while inside the sector (for 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2δ) is of order mg α (1 − cos 2δ) ≈ 2 mg α δ^2 ≈ 2 m g r^2/α, which is negligible under the stated “magnetic torque ≫ gravity” condition and r ≪ α.\n- The result relies on the superconducting flux conservation Φ_link = const and that initially the ring is fully within the uniform B region (so Φ0 = B π r^2).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,v_{0,\\min} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\,2 g \\alpha \\;+\\; \\dfrac{\\pi^{2} B^{2} r^{4}}{L\\, m}\\,}\\,} \\]"}

Let Δ be the angular separation (as seen from O) between the radii to the two small centers.

Because contacts are smooth, there is no friction.\n\nKey observation (tangent-chord geometry):\n- The line of centers C1C2 (the line of action of N) makes with the tangent at each contact point an angle equal to Δ/2. This is the standard theorem: the angle between a chord and the tangent equals half the intercepted arc.\n\nEquilibrium in the tangential directions:\n- Resolve forces on cylinder 1 (higher, weight P1) along the tangent to the circle at C1. The groove’s normal is radial, so it has no tangential component. The inter-cylinder normal N has tangential component N cos(Δ/2). The weight P1 has tangential component P1 cos φ (since the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at angle φ, the component of weight along that tangent equals P1 cos φ). Tangential equilibrium gives\n  N cos(Δ/2) = P1 cos φ.  (1)\n\n- Resolve forces on cylinder 2 (lower, weight P2) along the tangent at C2.

Hence the external magnetic flux through the ring is\n  Φ(z) = A Bz(z) = A μ0 n I f(z), with f(z) = (1/2) [1 − z / √(z^2 + R^2)].\n\n- Useful derivatives:\n  f′(z) = d/dz [ (1/2)(1 − z/ρ) ] = −(1/2) R^2 / (z^2 + R^2)^{3/2} = −(1/2) R^2 / ρ^3\n  f″(z) = (3/2) z R^2 / (z^2 + R^2)^{5/2} = (3/2) z R^2 / ρ^5\n\n  Therefore,\n  Φ′(z) = A μ0 n I f′(z) = − A μ0 n I (1/2) R^2 / ρ^3\n  Φ″(z) = A μ0 n I f″(z) = A μ0 n I (3/2) z R^2 / ρ^5\n\nFluxoid conservation and ring current\n- The ring becomes superconducting far from the solenoid where the external field vanishes (B → 0 as z → ∞). At that instant, the ring carries current I0 (given, flowing in +θ̂). Fluxoid conservation then fixes a constant:\n  Φ(z) + L i(z) = constant = L I0\n  so that for any z,\n  i(z) = I0 − Φ(z)/L = I0 − [A μ0 n I f(z)]/L.\n\nMagnetic force on the ring and equilibrium\n- The magnetic force on a (small) current loop in an external field can be written in terms of the flux as\n  Fz(z) = i(z) dΦ/dz = i(z) Φ′(z).\n  The total force along z is Ftot(z) = Fz(z) − m g.\n\n- Equilibrium at z = z0 (> 0) requires\n  Ftot(z0) = 0 ⇒ i(z0) Φ′(z0) − m g = 0\n  ⇒ [I0 − Φ(z0)/L] Φ′(z0) = m g.\n\nSmall oscillations: effective stiffness and period\n- Define the effective potential for the mechanical degree of freedom z with the superconducting constraint (Φ + L i = L I0):\n  U(z) = [Φ(z) − L I0]^2 / (2 L) + m g z.\n  Then the force is Ftot = −dU/dz, and the curvature at equilibrium gives the stiffness:\n  k ≡ U″(z0) = (1/L) [Φ′(z0)]^2 + (1/L) [Φ(z0) − L I0] Φ″(z0).\n\n- Using the equilibrium condition [Φ(z0) − L I0] = − m g L / Φ′(z0), the stiffness simplifies to\n  k = (Φ′(z0))^2 / L − m g [Φ″(z0)/Φ′(z0)].\n\n- Substituting the explicit derivatives of Φ:\n  Φ′(z0) = − A μ0 n I (1/2) R^2 / ρ0^3, with ρ0 ≡ √(z0^2 + R^2)\n  Φ″(z0) = A μ0 n I (3/2) z0 R^2 / ρ0^5\n  gives\n  (Φ′(z0))^2 / L = (A μ0 n I)^2 R^4 / [4 L ρ0^6]\n  − m g [Φ″(z0)/Φ′(z0)] = − m g [ ( (3/2) z0 R^2 / ρ0^5 ) / ( − (1/2) R^2 / ρ0^3 ) ]\n                        = + 3 m g z0 / ρ0^2.\n\n- Therefore,\n  k = (A μ0 n I)^2 R^4 / [4 L (z0^2 + R^2)^3] + 3 m g z0 / (z0^2 + R^2).\n\n- The small-oscillation angular frequency and period are\n  ω^2 = k / m = (A μ0 n I)^2 R^4 / [4 L m (z0^2 + R^2)^3] + 3 g z0 / (z0^2 + R^2),\n  T = 2π / ω.\n\nRemarks\n- Note that T does not depend explicitly on I0 once z0 is fixed. The trapped current I0 sets the equilibrium position z0 via [I0 − Φ(z0)/L] Φ′(z0) = m g, but the local curvature around z0 (and hence T) depends only on the geometry (R, z0, r via A), the solenoid drive (n I), the ring’s inductance L, and gravity.\n- The approximation r ≪ R was used to take Φ ≈ A Bz(z) with Bz uniform over the ring’s cross-section.\n\nFinal closed-form expression for the small-oscillation period about the stable equilibrium z = z0:\n- Let A = π r^2 and ρ0^2 = z0^2 + R^2.

The spaceship has a rest mass of $M$, and it uses the method of annihilating matter and antimatter to produce photons, which are then emitted directly backward to provide thrust. In the reference frame of the spaceship, the frequency of the photons emitted backward is $ u _{0}$. For simplicity, we assume that the \\\"windward side\\\" of the Trisolarian spaceship is a flat surface with an area $S$. During flight, dust floating in the universe may collide with it. We assume that the cosmic dust is composed of particles with rest mass $m$. For an observer on Earth: the spaceship moves at a constant speed of $v _1$, the particles in the cosmic dust have a speed of $v_2$ and move in the same direction as the spaceship, and the particles in the dust are uniformly distributed with a density of $n$. If, according to the Trisolarian beings on the spaceship, the cosmic dust undergoes a \\\"perfectly elastic collision\\\" upon impact with the spaceship, what is the number $N^{'}$ of photons that need to be emitted backward per unit time in the reference frame of the spaceship to maintain its constant speed? Given are Planck's constant $h$, the speed of light in vacuum $c$, and relativistic effects need to be considered.\n", "solutions": "There are two reference frames; let's set up the agreements first.

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession. Solve for its precession angular frequency $\\Omega$ (the answer can be expressed in terms of $q_{0}$ and $r_{0}$).", "solutions": "According to the problem statement, a single ideal gas under the isothermal model can satisfy the Boltzmann distribution in any continuous potential energy field distribution.

In the corotating frame the effective potential for a particle of mass ms is Ueff,s(r) = −(1/2) ms ω^2 r^2. For an isothermal ideal gas at temperature T0, the Boltzmann density is\n  ns(r) = ns(0) exp[−Ueff,s(r)/(kB T0)] = ns(0) exp[(ms ω^2 r^2)/(2 kB T0)].\n\n- Define k ≡ ω^2/(2 kB T0) (as suggested), so that\n  ns(r) = ns(0) exp(ms k r^2).\n\n- Take the positive ions to have mass mi (mi ≈ mN), and electrons me. Under “strong ionization,” we take one electron per ion and uniformity along z, with a cylindrical cross-section of radius R and height H (H ≫ R). Let Ni = Ne = N be the total numbers of ions and electrons in the cylinder. Then the normalizations follow from\n  N = ∫V ns(r) dV = H ∫0^R 2π r ns(0) e^{ms k r^2} dr\n    = H 2π ns(0) [e^{ms k R^2} − 1]/(2 ms k).\n\n  Hence\n  ns(0) = N ms k / [π H (e^{ms k R^2} − 1)].\n\n- Therefore the number densities are\n  ni(r) = N mi k / [π H (e^{mi k R^2} − 1)] e^{mi k r^2}, \n  ne(r) = N me k / [π H (e^{me k R^2} − 1)] e^{me k r^2}.\n\n- The charge density is ρ(r) = e[ni(r) − ne(r)]. For an infinite (or very tall) cylinder with translational symmetry along z, Gauss’s law gives for the radial electric field inside:\n  E(r) 2π r L = Qenc(r)/ε0, where Qenc/L = ∫0^r ρ(r′) 2π r′ dr′ is the enclosed charge per unit height. Thus\n  E(r) = 1/(ε0 r) ∫0^r ρ(r′) r′ dr′.\n\n  Compute the enclosed line charge (per unit height) for each species:\n  λs(r) = e ∫0^r ns(r′) 2π r′ dr′\n         = e 2π ns(0) [e^{ms k r^2} − 1]/(2 ms k)\n         = e [N/H] [e^{ms k r^2} − 1]/[e^{ms k R^2} − 1].\n\n  Hence the net enclosed line charge is\n  λenc(r) = e [N/H] [ (e^{mi k r^2} − 1)/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − (e^{me k r^2} − 1)/(e^{me k R^2} − 1) ].\n\n  Therefore the electric field is\n  E(r) = λenc(r)/(2π ε0 r)\n       = C Δf(r)/r,\n\n  where, for conciseness, I define\n  C ≡ (e N/H)/(2π ε0), \n  f(ms; r) ≡ [e^{ms k r^2} − 1]/[e^{ms k R^2} − 1], \n  and Δf(r) ≡ f(mi; r) − f(me; r).\n\n  Note the sign: for typical mi ≫ me, ni grows radially faster than ne, so Δf(r) > 0 for r > 0, implying E(r) points radially outward. A negatively charged UAV (q0 < 0) then experiences a radially inward electric force that can provide the centripetal requirement.\n\n2) Circular corotation of the UAV and the equilibrium condition\n\n- The UAV (mass m, net charge q0) moves in the horizontal plane at angular speed θ̇ = ω with radius r0. The in-plane equations of motion (in the inertial frame) under a purely radial electric field E(r) are\n  m (r̈ − r θ̇^2) = q0 E(r), \n  m (r θ̈ + 2 ṙ θ̇) = 0.\n\n- A circular orbit of fixed radius r = r0 with θ̇ = ω obeys r̈ = 0, so\n  − m r0 ω^2 = q0 E(r0) = q0 [C Δf(r0)/r0].\n\n  Hence the equilibrium condition is\n  q0 C Δf(r0)/r0 = − m ω^2 r0.\n\n  Equivalently,\n  q0 E(r0) = − m ω^2 r0, \n  i.e. the electric force provides precisely the centripetal force.\n\n3) Small radial perturbations and epicyclic/precession frequency\n\n- Consider a small radial displacement r(t) = r0 + δr(t) with |δr| ≪ r0 and initial ṙ(0) = v0 ≪ ω r0. Let θ̇(t) = ω + δθ̇(t). Since the electric force is central, angular momentum L = m r^2 θ̇ is conserved:\n  L = m r0^2 ω = m (r0 + δr)^2 (ω + δθ̇) ≈ m r0^2 ω + m [2 r0 ω δr + r0^2 δθ̇].\n\n  Therefore 2 r0 ω δr + r0^2 δθ̇ = 0 ⇒ δθ̇ = − (2 ω/r0) δr.\n\n- Linearize the radial equation m (r̈ − r θ̇^2) = q0 E(r) about the circular solution:\n  r̈ ≈ δr̈, \n  r θ̇^2 ≈ (r0 + δr) (ω + δθ̇)^2 ≈ r0 ω^2 + ω^2 δr + 2 r0 ω δθ̇,\n  E(r) ≈ E(r0) + E′(r0) δr.\n\n  Using the circular-orbit relation q0 E(r0) = − m ω^2 r0 and substituting δθ̇, one obtains the linearized radial equation\n  m δr̈ + [3 m ω^2 − q0 E′(r0)] δr = 0.\n\n- Thus, the small radial oscillation frequency (the “precession” or epicyclic frequency) is\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E′(r0).\n\n  This is a general and very useful compact result: it ties the apsidal/epicyclic frequency to the local radial gradient of the central force (here the electric field) about the corotating circular orbit.\n\n4) Evaluate E′(r0) for the rotating plasma and eliminate unknown normalizations\n\n- From E(r) = C Δf(r)/r, its radial derivative is\n  E′(r) = C [Δf′(r)/r − Δf(r)/r^2], \n  with\n  Δf′(r) = d/dr{f(mi; r) − f(me; r)}\n          = 2 r [ mi k e^{mi k r^2}/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − me k e^{me k r^2}/(e^{me k R^2} − 1) ].\n\n- Use the equilibrium condition to eliminate the unknown constant C (or N/H). From q0 C Δf(r0)/r0 = − m ω^2 r0, one has\n  q0 C = − m ω^2 r0^2 / Δf(r0).\n\n  Therefore\n  (q0/m) E′(r0) = (q0/m) C [Δf′(r0)/r0 − Δf(r0)/r0^2]\n                 = − ω^2 r0^2 [Δf′(r0)/(r0 Δf(r0)) − Δf(r0)/(r0^2 Δf(r0)) ]\n                 = − ω^2 [ r0 Δf′(r0)/Δf(r0) − 1 ].\n\n- Plugging this into Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E′(r0) yields an explicit, normalization-free formula:\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 + ω^2 [ r0 Δf′(r0)/Δf(r0) − 1 ]\n       = ω^2 [ 2 + r0 Δf′(r0)/Δf(r0) ].\n\n  Using the explicit Δf′(r0), this can be written compactly in terms of the given parameter k and the masses:\n  r0 Δf′(r0)/Δf(r0) = 2 r0^2\n    [ mi k e^{mi k r0^2}/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − me k e^{me k r0^2}/(e^{me k R^2} − 1) ]\n    /\n    [ (e^{mi k r0^2} − 1)/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1) − (e^{me k r0^2} − 1)/(e^{me k R^2} − 1) ].\n\n  Hence\n  Ω^2 = ω^2\n        {\n          2\n          + 2 r0^2\n            [\n              mi k e^{mi k r0^2}/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1)\n              −\n              me k e^{me k r0^2}/(e^{me k R^2} − 1)\n            ]\n            /\n            [\n              (e^{mi k r0^2} − 1)/(e^{mi k R^2} − 1)\n              −\n              (e^{me k r0^2} − 1)/(e^{me k R^2} − 1)\n            ]\n        }.\n\n- Useful checks and limits:\n  - If the enclosed charge produces an approximately uniform volume charge density (so E ∝ r locally), then Δf(r) ∝ r^2 locally, giving r (Δf′/Δf) ≈ 2. The formula reduces to Ω ≈ 2 ω, the expected inertial/epicyclic frequency in solid-body rotation with a harmonic central restoring force.\n  - The sign of q0 that allows the circular corotation is fixed by q0 E(r0) = − m ω^2 r0. Since E(r) typically points outward (Δf > 0), this requires q0 < 0 (the UAV charges negatively), consistent with lightning-prone environments where electrons can attach to the vehicle.\n\n5) A very compact expression “in terms of q0 and r0”\n\n- If one prefers an expression involving q0 and the local field gradient directly (without inserting the plasma model), the linearization result\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) [dE(r)/dr]_{r=r0}\n  already gives Ω once E(r) is known or measured at r0.\n\n- When you do use the plasma model, the dependence on the unknown normalization (eN/H) cancels thanks to the equilibrium condition q0 E(r0) = − m ω^2 r0, so the final Ω depends only on (ω, r0, T0 via k, R, mi, me).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{General small–amplitude precession (epicyclic) frequency:}\\quad\n\\Omega^{2}=3\\,\\omega^{2}-\\frac{q_{0}}{m}\\,\\left.\\frac{dE(r)}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_{0}}.\n\\\\[6pt]\n&\\text{For the rotating isothermal plasma (with }k=\\omega^{2}/(2k_{B}T_{0})\\text{), using }E(r)=\\dfrac{C\\,\\Delta f(r)}{r},\\;\n\\Delta f(r)=\\frac{e^{m_{i}kr^{2}}-1}{e^{m_{i}kR^{2}}-1}-\\frac{e^{m_{e}kr^{2}}-1}{e^{m_{e}kR^{2}}-1},\n\\\\\n&\\text{and the circular–orbit condition }q_{0}E(r_{0})=-m\\omega^{2}r_{0},\n\\text{ one obtains the explicit result (independent of }q_{0}\\text{):}\n\\\\[4pt]\n&\\qquad\\Omega^{2}=\\omega^{2}\\left[\n2\n+\n2r_{0}^{2}\\,\n\\frac{\nm_{i}k\\,\\dfrac{e^{m_{i}k r_{0}^{2}}}{e^{m_{i}k R^{2}}-1}\n-\nm_{e}k\\,\\dfrac{e^{m_{e}k r_{0}^{2}}}{e^{m_{e}k R^{2}}-1}\n}{\n\\dfrac{e^{m_{i}k r_{0}^{2}}-1}{e^{m_{i}k R^{2}}-1}\n-\n\\dfrac{e^{m_{e}k r_{0}^{2}}-1}{e^{m_{e}k R^{2}}-1}\n}\n\\right].\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}
