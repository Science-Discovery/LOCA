Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\).

Problem Analysis  \nA uniform coin (mass m, radius r) rests with its left portion on a smooth horizontal tabletop and its right rim barely overhanging the edge. A short vertical impulse I is delivered to the exposed (right-hand) rim. Immediately after the impact the coin has:  \n• a translational speed v₀ of its centre of mass (CM) parallel to the tabletop, and  \n• an angular speed ω₀ about an axis through its CM perpendicular to the table.  \n\nAs the coin subsequently “tips” about the table edge, its CM must rise against gravity. The question is: What is the minimum initial CM speed v₀, min that allows the coin to lift completely off the table? (Answer in terms of g and r.)\n\n2. Approach  \nRight after the impulse the coin pivots about the table-edge contact point O (no friction, so pure rotation about O is instantaneous).  \n• Use the parallel–axis theorem to find the moment of inertia about O.  \n• Relate ω₀ and v₀ through the geometry of pure rotation about O.  \n• Apply mechanical-energy conservation between the instant after impact and the instant the last point of the coin leaves the table (normal force at O becomes zero).  \nThe CM must rise a vertical distance r; equating the required gravitational potential energy to the initial kinetic energy gives v₀, min.\n\n3. Solution Steps  \n\nStep 1: Moment of inertia about the edge  \nMoment of inertia about the CM: I_CM = ½ m r²  \nDistance from CM to edge O ≈ r (the coin just protrudes by a thin rim).  \nApplying the parallel-axis theorem:  \n\nI_O = I_CM + m r² = ½ m r² + m r² = 3/2 m r²\n\nStep 2: Kinetic energy right after the impulse  \nFor pure rotation about O, the linear and angular speeds are related by  \nv₀ = ω₀ r  ⇒ ω₀ = v₀ / r\n\nTotal kinetic energy right after impact:  \n\nK_i = ½ I_O ω₀²  \n  = ½ (3/2 m r²) (v₀² / r²)  \n  = ¾ m v₀²\n\nStep 3: Gravitational potential change before lift-off  \nThe CM must climb from the table plane to be level with the edge (distance r):  \n\nΔU = m g r\n\nStep 4: Energy conservation for the limiting (minimum-speed) case  \n\nK_i = ΔU  \n¾ m v₀, min² = m g r  \n\nSolve for v₀, min:  \n\nv₀, min² = (4/3) g r  \nv₀, min = √(4 g r / 3)\n\n4. Interpretation  \n• If the CM speed equals √(4 g r /3), the coin just exhausts its kinetic energy in lifting the CM to the table edge; the normal force at O becomes zero and the coin leaves the surface.  \n• Any smaller initial speed leaves some weight supported, so the coin falls back.  \n• The result is independent of the coin’s mass and depends only on g and its radius r.\n\n### Final Answer  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,v_{0,\\min}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{4gr}{3}}\\,}\n\\]"}

(2)\n\n    Combine (1) with a₁ (found above):  \n       a₂ = a₁ − v₀² / l = (v₀² / l) − (v₀² / l) = 0  \n       From (2) a₃ = a₂ = 0  \n\n    Resulting vertical accelerations  \n       a₁ =  v₀² / l (upward) ,   a₂ = a₃ = 0.  \n\n3.4  Newton’s second law along the string (vertical) direction  \n\n    Ball 3                T₃ − m g = m a₃ = 0  ⇒  T₃ = m g               (3)\n\n    Ball 2                T₂ − T₃ − m g = m a₂ = 0  \n                          ⇒ T₂ = T₃ + m g = m g + m g = 2 m g             (4)\n\n    (For completeness, ball 1 obeys T₁ − T₂ − m g = m a₁ = m v₀² / l,  \n     giving T₁ = 3 m g + m v₀² / l.)  \n\n     Equation (4) already gives the desired quantity.  \n\n4. Discussion  \n   • No horizontal impulsive forces act on balls 2 and 3; they therefore receive no horizontal velocity right after the blow.  \n   • Nevertheless, the upper ball’s horizontal motion requires an upward (centripetal) acceleration, which changes only the tensions in the strings connected to it.  \n   • The middle string must still support the weight of the two lower masses, hence its tension is simply 2 mg and is independent of v₀.  \n\n### Final Answer  \n\nImmediately after the hammer impact the tension in the middle string is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\, T_2 = 2\\,m\\,g \\,}\n\\]"}

{"id": "MECHANICS/101", "questions": "The problem discusses a stick figure model. The stick figure's head is a uniform sphere with a radius of $r$ and a mass of $m$, while the rest of the body consists of uniform rods with negligible thickness and a mass per unit length of $\\lambda$. All parts are connected by hinges. Specifically, the torso and both arms have a length of $l$, while the legs have a length of $1.2l$. $\\theta$ represents the angle between the arms and the torso, and $\\varphi$ represents the angle between the legs and the extended torso line (not an obtuse angle). The stick figure is composed of a head, a torso, two arms, and two legs. Initially, the stick figure is in a state where $\\theta=\\textstyle{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ and $\\varphi={\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$. The head has a mass of $m=0.6\\lambda l$, with the result expressed in terms of $\\lambda$. \n\nThe stick figure is a simulation of a real biological body, so if necessary, the connections between the torso and the arms/legs, in addition to providing interaction forces, can also exert a couple (i.e., a torque), even if there is no interaction force between them. This net torque is independent of the choice of reference point. In the following discussion, this will be referred to simply as a \"couple.\"\n\nDuring a certain free-fall motion, the stick figure, overwhelmed with panic, forgets to bring its legs together and swings its arms and torso with an amplitude of $\\theta_{0}$ (small angle) and an angular frequency of $\\omega$.

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity.

This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2).

General Approach  \nThe solution is obtained in two separate steps that are repeated from rod to rod.\n\nA. Impulsive step (collision)   \n Relate the angular velocity just before impact,  ω⁻, to the angular velocity just after impact,  ω⁺, by  \n • conservation of angular momentum about the hinge of the next rod, and  \n • the condition of zero relative velocity at the contact point (e = 0).\n\nB. Free-fall step (flight)   \n Once struck, a rod rotates from the vertical position (θ = 0) to the collision angle θc, at which its top touches the next upright rod.  \n Energy conservation during this fall gives the angular velocity just before the next impact, ω⁻, in terms of the angular velocity it received at the previous impact, ω⁺.\n\nCombining A and B yields a two-step map (ω⁺ → ω⁻ → ω⁺ of the next rod).  \nIn the steady regime the values repeat, giving two simultaneous algebraic equations from which ω∞ is obtained.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Detailed Solution  \n\n3.1  Collision geometry  \nFor a rod of length h that tips through an angle θ (measured from the vertical), the top moves horizontally by h sin θ.  \nImpact with the next upright rod occurs when this horizontal displacement equals the spacing l,\n\n h sin θc = l   ⟹  sin θc = l / h.     (1)\n\nDefine\n c ≡ cos θc = √(1 − (l/h)²).   (2)\n\n3.2  Impulsive step (ω⁻ → ω⁺)  \n\nConsider the (n)-th rod just before it hits the (n+1)-st rod.  \nAt the instant of impact both rods are in the configuration sketched below.\n\n• The contact point lies a distance y = h cos θc above the ground and horizontally at x = l from the (n)-th hinge.  \n The velocity of that point on rod n is \n  vₙ = ω⁻ y  (to the right).              \n\n• The same geometric point on rod (n+1) (which is y = h cos θc above its own hinge) acquires velocity  \n  vₙ₊₁ = ω⁺ y.\n\nPerfectly inelastic impact (e = 0) demands zero relative normal velocity, hence\n\n vₙ = vₙ₊₁  ⟹  ω⁻ = ω⁺.                         (3)\n\nTherefore both rods have exactly the same angular speed immediately after contact.\n\nLet J be the horizontal impulse exchanged during the collision.  \nBecause the hinges are frictionless, the only external impulses on the two-rod system act at the hinges themselves; taking moments about the hinge of rod (n+1) removes those unknowns.  \nWith I = (1/3) m h² the moment of inertia of a slender rod about its hinge, conservation of angular momentum about that hinge gives\n\n I ω⁻ = I ω⁺ + I ω⁺       ⟹      ω⁺ = ω⁻ / 2.        (4)\n\n(Equation 3 showed ω⁻ = ω⁺, but combining with the moment equation forces the unique solution ω⁺ = ω⁻/2.  Hence the pre-impact rod gives up one half of its angular momentum to the next rod, both leaving the collision with the common speed ω⁻/2.)\n\nDefine the numerical ratio\n\n k ≡ ω⁺ / ω⁻ = 1/2.                        (5)\n\nThe remarkable feature is that k = 1/2 is independent of the spacing l and of the collision angle θc.\n\n3.3  Free-fall step (ω⁺ → ω⁻)  \n\nImmediately after impact a rod is still vertical (θ = 0) and rotates with angular speed ω⁺.  \nIt then falls freely under gravity until its top travels the distance l and the rod reaches θ = θc.  \nEnergy conservation between these two instants gives\n\n ½ I ω⁻² = ½ I ω⁺² + m g (h/2)(1 − cos θc).   (6)\n\nInsert I = (1/3) m h² and rearrange:\n\n ω⁻² = ω⁺² + 3g/h (1 − cos θc).          (7)\n\n3.4  Steady-state condition  \n\nIn the settled wave every rod repeats the same two numbers\n ω⁺ = ω∞, ω⁻ = Ω∞.\nUsing (5) and (7)\n\n ω∞ = k Ω∞ = Ω∞ / 2,                    (8)\n\n Ω∞² = ω∞² + 3g/h (1 − c).

(10)\n\nTaking the positive root (angular speed is positive),\n\n ω∞ = √[ g/h (1 − cos θc) ].

(13)\n\nThus ω∞ grows linearly with the gap l and, expectedly, with √g/h.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Final Answer  \n\nThe common angular velocity with which every rod leaves its collision in the steady domino wave is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\n\\omega_{\\infty}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{h}\\,\\Bigl(1-\\cos\\theta_{c}\\Bigr)}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{h}\\left[1-\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\dfrac{l}{h}\\right)^{2}}\\right]}\n\\;}\n\\]\n\nwhere θc is the collision angle satisfying sin θc = l/h."}

Problem Analysis  \n    •  A homogeneous regular N-sided prism (mass m, circum-radius l) rests on a horizontal table.  \n    •  A horizontal force F acts at the centre, large enough to make the prism “walk’’ to the right: in every step it tips about the right-hand bottom vertex and the next face slaps down on the table.  \n    •  Each impact with the table is **completely inelastic** (the new face sticks to the table).  \n    •  After many steps the motion becomes periodic: the angular speed just **after** every impact acquires a constant value ω.  \n       The task is to determine this steady-state angular speed ω.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  Physical Approach (overview)  \n    a)  One step consists of a rotation through an angle  \n        Δφ = 2π/N about the currently supporting vertex.  \n        During this rotation the centre of mass (CM) advances horizontally by  \n        Δx = l sin(2π/N).  \n        Hence the external force performs the work  \n        W = F Δx = F l sin(2π/N).  \n\n    b)  Just before the new face hits the table the prism rotates about the **old** vertex with angular speed ω_b.  \n        Immediately after the inelastic blow it rotates about the **new** vertex with angular speed ω_a = ω.  \n        The collision is assumed instantaneous; impulses from gravity or the force F are negligible during the very short impact,  \n        so the **angular momentum about the new vertex** is conserved.\n\n    c)  Using that conservation we find a fixed ratio λ = ω/ω_b.  \n        The kinetic energy *lost* in the collision is  \n        ΔE_loss = ½( I + m l² )(ω_b² – ω²) = ½ S ω_b² (1 – λ²)  \n        with S ≡ I + m l² (I is the moment of inertia about the CM for the longitudinal axis).  \n\n    d)  In the steady regime the mechanical energy added in every step (W) is **exactly** the energy dissipated in the impact:  \n        W = ΔE_loss.  \n        Combining b), c) and d) yields the required steady angular speed ω.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.

Problem Analysis  \nThe guided ray starts in the core (refractive index n₁ ≡ n) and strikes the core–cladding interface under an angle θ that is larger than the critical angle, so total internal reflection (TIR) occurs.  \nThe question: “What phase shift φ does the monochromatic plane‐wave acquire after its very first reflection?”  \nThe only quantity that is required is the argument (phase) of the complex Fresnel reflection coefficient r for TIR.\n\n2. Approach  \n• Write the ordinary Fresnel reflection coefficient for TE (or TM – for a rectangular dielectric waveguide the same functional form is obtained when the electric field is parallel to the interface).  \n• Impose Snell’s law and continue it analytically into the TIR regime so that the cosine of the transmitted angle becomes imaginary.  \n• Extract the argument of r; its modulus is |r| = 1 for TIR, so r can be written as e^{iφ}.  \n• Express the result entirely through the incidence angle θ and the two indices n (core) and n₂ ≡ n + δn (cladding, with n₂ < n).\n\n3. Detailed Solution  \n\nStep 1 Fresnel coefficient  \nFor an interface between media (n₁, n₂) the (TE-polarised) amplitude reflection coefficient is  \n\nr =  ( n₁ cos θ₁ − n₂ cos θ₂ ) / ( n₁ cos θ₁ + n₂ cos θ₂ ).             (1)\n\nHere θ₁ = θ is the incidence angle inside the core and θ₂ the angle in the cladding.\n\nStep 2 Snell’s law and analytic continuation  \nSnell: n₁ sin θ₁ = n₂ sin θ₂   ⇒   sin θ₂ = (n₁/n₂) sin θ.  \n\nBecause the ray is guided, sin θ > n₂/n₁, hence sin θ₂ > 1 and θ₂ becomes complex.  \nWrite\n\ncos θ₂ = √(1 − sin²θ₂) = i γ,    γ = √[ sin² θ − (n₂/n₁)² ].        (2)\n\nγ is real and positive.\n\nStep 3 Substitute cos θ₂ = iγ in (1)  \nr = ( n₁ cos θ − i n₂ γ ) / ( n₁ cos θ + i n₂ γ ).               (3)\n\nDefine  \na ≡ n₁ cos θ ,     b ≡ n₂ γ    (b > 0).\n\nThen r = (a − i b)/(a + i b).   Its modulus is unity:\n\n|r|² = (a² + b²)/(a² + b²) = 1.        (4)\n\nTherefore r can be written in exponential form\n\nr = exp( −2 i arctan( b / a ) ).                                        (5)\n\nStep 4 Phase shift  \nComparing r = e^{iφ} with (5),\n\nφ = −2 arctan( b / a ) = −2 arctan [ n₂ γ /( n₁ cos θ ) ].             (6)\n\nInsert γ from (2):\n\nφ = −2 arctan\n     ⎡ n₂  √( sin² θ − (n₂/n₁)² )  / ( n₁ cos θ ) ⎤ .                (7)\n\nEverything is now expressed through θ, n₁ (= n) and n₂ (= n + δn).\n\nStep 5 Alternative k-vector form (often used in wave-guide texts)  \nLet k₀ = 2π/λ .  \nTransverse component:   k_y = k₀ n₁ sin θ.  \nNormal component in core: k_z = k₀ n₁ cos θ.  \nEvanescent decay constant in cladding: β = √( k_y² − k₀² n₂² ).  \nThen r = (k_z − i β)/(k_z + i β) ⇒ φ = −2 arctan( β / k_z ), which is identical to (7).\n\n4. Physical meaning  \nBecause β ≠ 0 the reflection is loss-less but accompanied by a negative phase shift −|φ|. That phase shift is the origin of the Goos–Hänchen lateral displacement and governs the modal dispersion of the fibre.\n\n### Final Answer  \nPhase shift acquired by a guided ray after one total internal reflection at the core–cladding interface:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{%\n\\displaystyle\n\\varphi \\;=\\; -\\,2\\,\\arctan\\!\\Bigg[\\,\\frac{\\,n_2\\,\\sqrt{\\sin^{2}\\theta-\\left(\\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)^{2}}}{\\,n_1\\cos\\theta}\\,\\Bigg]\n\\;=\\; -\\,2\\,\\arctan\\!\\Bigg[\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{k_y^{\\,2}-k_0^{2}n_2^{2}}}{\\,k_0 n_1\\cos\\theta}\\,\\Bigg]\n}\n\\]\n\nwhere  \nn₁ = n (core index),  n₂ = n + δn < n (cladding index),  \nθ is the incidence angle inside the core (θ > θ_c = arcsin(n₂/n₁)),  \nk₀ = 2π/λ,  k_y = k₀ n₁ sin θ."}

Bound charge contributes no net monopole charge (it integrates to zero) and, in a uniform field, produces no net force.\n\n   c) Therefore it is sufficient to calculate the field 𝐄 produced by sources external to the sphere at the location of the free charge Q; that external field is exactly the given uniform field 𝐄₀.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────\n3.  Detailed Solution Steps  \n\nStep 1:  Identify the relevant charge.  \n   • Free charge on the metal: Q (given).  \n   • Bound surface charge on the dielectric: integrates to zero, so its monopole moment vanishes.  This means it can create only higher moments (dipole, quadrupole …), none of which feel a net force in a uniform field.\n\nStep 2:  Recognise the field that acts on the free charge.  \n   • The total electric field at the position of any element of Q can be decomposed as  \n          𝐄_total = 𝐄_self + 𝐄_ext.  \n   • 𝐄_self is produced by Q itself (plus its bound mirror charge) and cannot exert a net force on the charge distribution that created it (Newton’s third law for electrostatics).  \n   • 𝐄_ext is produced by all other sources—here that is precisely the uniform external field 𝐄₀.\n\nStep 3:  Compute the net force.  \n   • Force on an element dq of free charge: d𝐅 = dq 𝐄_ext.  \n   • Integrate over the whole free charge Q:  \n\n         𝐅 = ∫ dq 𝐄_ext = Q 𝐄_ext = Q 𝐄₀.  \n\n   • The direction is the same as 𝐄₀ if Q > 0, opposite if Q < 0; the magnitude is |Q|E₀.\n\nStep 4 (optional cross-check with energy method):  \n   • Electrostatic energy in the presence of free charge Q located in the uniform field:  \n         U = –Q 𝐄₀·𝐫_c   (𝑟_c ≡ position of the sphere’s centre).  \n   • Translate the sphere by an infinitesimal displacement δ𝐫 parallel to 𝐄₀:  \n         δU = –Q 𝐄₀·δ𝐫  ⇒  𝐅 = –∇_r U = Q 𝐄₀.  \n   • Same result, confirming independence of ε_r.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────\n4.

In a perfectly uniform field, the monopole feels a force Q𝐄₀ while the dipole feels none.  Therefore the dielectric constant of the surrounding liquid does not influence the net force; it only modifies the internal distribution of field lines near the sphere.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────\n### Final Answer\nThe electrostatic force on the charged conducting sphere immersed in the dielectric is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;F = |Q|\\,E_{0}\\;}\n\\]\n\ndirected along 𝐄₀ when Q > 0 and opposite to 𝐄₀ when Q < 0.

A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined. If the distance OB is measured to be $L/2$, determine the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube when the ball is at point B.

Detailed Derivation  \n\n3.1  Coordinates  \nLet  \nû = (cos α, sin α)          (unit vector along AB, to the right)  \nv̂ = (sin α, –cos α)         (unit vector perpendicular to AB, pointing towards the interior of the frame)  \n\nMid-point of AB:             M = (x_M, y_M)                                (unknown)  \nRight end of AB:             B = M + c û  \nLeft  end of AB:             A = M – c û  \nCentre of gravity:           G = M + d v̂                                   (d = half the width)  \n\n3.2  Consequence of “no torque about the nail”  \nThe only torque about O comes from the weight, hence OG must be vertical: x_G = 0.  \nSince x_G = x_M + d sin α, we obtain  \n\n(1) x_M = –d sin α.  \n\n3.3  Horizontal force equilibrium  \nLet T be the common tension.  \nForces on the frame:  \nF_A = –T (OA/|OA|), F_B = –T (OB/|OB|).  \nTheir horizontal components cancel only if  \n\n(2) OA_x /|OA| + OB_x /|OB| = 0.  \n\nWith (1) this reads  \n\n( d sin α + c cos α) |OB| = ( c cos α – d sin α) |OA|.  (★)  \n\n3.4  Eliminating yM and using the length of the string  \n\nDenote  \nA ≡ d sin α + c cos α,  B ≡ c cos α – d sin α.  \n\nFrom the geometry one has  \n\n|OA|^2 = A^2 + (y_M – c sin α)^2,  |OB|^2 = B^2 + (y_M + c sin α)^2.  \n\nSquare (★) and simplify; the mixed terms cancel and one obtains  \n\ny_M = –(c^2 cos α)/d.  (3)  \n\nInsert (3) into |OA|:  \n\n|OA| = √{ A^2 + [ y_M – c sin α ]^2 }  \n     = √{ A^2 + [ –(c^2 cos α)/d – c sin α ]^2 }  \n     = A √{ c^2 + d^2 } / d.  \n\nBecause |OB| /|OA| = B /A, the total length of the string is  \n\n|OA| + |OB| = |OA| ( 1 + B/A ) = |OA| (A + B)/A = |OA| · 2c cos α /A.  \n\nSetting this equal to 2a gives  \n\n2a = 2c cos α  √{ c^2 + d^2 } / d,  \n\nhence  \n\n(4) cos α = (a d) / [ c √{ c^2 + d^2 } ].  \n\nFinally  \n\nsin α = √{ 1 – cos^2 α }  \n      = √{ c^2(c^2+d^2) – a^2 d^2 } / [ c √{ c^2 + d^2 } ].  \n\nCondition for reality: the radicand must be positive, exactly the inequality stated in the problem:\n\nc^4 + c^2 d^2 – a^2 d^2 > 0 ⇔ c^4 > a^2 d^2 – c^2 d^2.  \n\n───────────────────────────────────────────\n\n4.

Solution Steps  \n\nStep 3.1 Critical coupling α_c  \nFor s–waves (ℓ = 0) write the radial Schrödinger equation for u(r)=rR(r):\n\n  −(ħ²/2μ)uʺ(r)+[ħ²ℓ(ℓ+1)/(2μr²)−α/r²]u(r)=Eu(r).         (1)\n\nAt ℓ=0 the only 1/r² term comes from the attractive potential.  \nNear r→0 the kinetic term behaves like −(ħ²/2μ)uʺ≈(ħ²/2μ)(s²−¼)u/r² for u∼rˢ.  \nSubstituting into (1) gives the algebraic (indicial) equation  \n\n  s²−¼−(2μ/ħ²)α=0.         (2)\n\nSquare–integrability at the origin demands Re s > −½.  This yields  \n\n  (2μ/ħ²)α ≤ ¼ ⇒ α ≤ ħ²/(8μ).        (3)\n\nWith μ=M/2,  \n\n  α_c = ħ²/(8μ) = ħ²/(4M).                             (4)\n\nThus the ground state is stable provided α≤α_c.\n\nStep 3.2 Choose the working coupling  \nThe experiment is done at  \n\n  α = α_c/2 = ħ²/(8M).                       (5)\n\nStep 3.3 Bound–state energies for the safe potential  \nFor α≤α_c there is an ordinary discrete spectrum that can be treated in the same way as for the hydrogen\natom (the radial equation is identical apart from replacing e² by α).  \nThe energy levels are  \n\n  E_n = − μ α² /(2ħ² n²),  n=1,2,3,…                (6)\n\nInsert μ=M/2 and the chosen α of (5):\n\n  E_n = − (M/2) (ħ²/8M)² /(2ħ² n²)\n      = − M ħ⁴ /(256 M² ħ² n²)\n      = − ħ² /(256 M n²).

(8)\n\nStep 3.4 Excitation energy to n = 2  \nThe energy that must be delivered to X₂ is  \n\n  ΔE = E₂ − E₁ = − ħ²/1024 M − (− ħ²/256 M)\n        = (3/1024) ħ² / M.                   (9)\n\nStep 3.5 Threshold incident energy  \nThe projectile is ultra–relativistic (m≈0) so its energy and momentum obey p=E/c.\nIn the limit that the heavy target hardly recoils (M≫ΔE/c²) energy conservation\nrequires only that E provide at least ΔE; any extra momentum can be taken up by the small recoil and by\nthe subsequently emitted photon.  To first order, therefore, the minimum energy is\n\n  E₁ = ΔE = 3 ħ² / (1024 M).                (10)\n\nIt is often convenient to express E₁ directly in terms of the coupling α that is actually used:\nfrom (5) ħ²/M = 8α, so  \n\n  E₁ = (3/1024)(ħ²/M) = 3α/128.            (11)\n\n4.

Problem Analysis  \nThe steel ruler, with evenly spaced graduations of pitch d, behaves like a reflection grating.  \n• The laser beam travels along the +z–axis, hits the ruler, and is reflected toward a distant wall at a horizontal distance L.  \n• The ruler is horizontal (ξ = 0) but rotated in the horizontal plane by an angle φ relative to the z-axis.  \nBecause of that rotation the projected spacing between successive rulings in the direction perpendicular to the beam is reduced from d to d cos φ.  \nThe task is to find, for diffraction orders m ≈ 0, the transverse separation Δy between adjacent principal maxima (e.g. between m = 0 and m = ±1) on the wall.  \n\n2. Approach  \n1. Use the grating (reflection) equation adapted to an obliquely oriented line grating.  \n2. Convert the diffraction angle θm of order m into a position ym on the wall through simple geometry.  \n3. Linearise for small θ (m ≈ 0) to obtain a uniform spacing; differentiate to obtain Δy.  \n\n3. Solution Steps  \n\nStep 1:  Effective grating period  \nThe rulings are straight and mutually parallel.  \nIn the ruler’s own coordinate frame the period is d.  \nWhen the ruler is rotated by φ in the horizontal plane, only the component of the ruling separation that is perpendicular to the incident beam produces phase change.  \nEffective period seen by the beam:  \nd⊥ = d cos φ.  \n\nStep 2:  Grating (reflection) equation  \nFor a reflective grating with normal incidence the outgoing angle θm of the m-th order relative to the grating normal satisfies  \nd⊥ sin θm = m λ, m = 0, ±1, ±2, …  \n⇒ sin θm = m λ ⁄(d cos φ).                       (1)  \n\nStep 3:  Relating θm to screen coordinate ym  \nThe wall is a distance L from the point of reflection (along +z).  \nIn the small-angle region near the central maximum,\n\ntan θm ≈ θm   and   sin θm ≈ θm.  \n\nHence  \nym = L tan θm ≈ L θm ≈ L m λ ⁄(d cos φ).         (2)  \n\nStep 4:  Spacing between successive maxima  \nLet ym be the y-coordinate of order m.  \nFrom (2) the difference between successive orders is\n\nΔy = y_{m+1} − y_m ≈ L [(m+1) − m] λ ⁄(d cos φ) = L λ ⁄(d cos φ).         (3)  \n\nBecause the expression is independent of m (to first order), the fringes are equally spaced near the zeroth order.  \n\n4. Physical checks  \n• The result reduces to the familiar Δy = L λ/d when φ = 0 (ruler parallel to y-axis).  \n• The spacing increases with φ because rotating the ruler reduces the effective period, thereby increasing diffraction angles.  \n• Making the graduations thinner or thicker affects only intensity, not the positions, so Δy remains valid.  \n\n### Final Answer  \nThe transverse spacing of the principal maxima near the central (zeroth-order) maximum is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\Delta y \\;=\\; \\frac{L\\,\\lambda}{d\\,\\cos\\phi}}\n\\]"}

But B² = A²(1–e²), hence\n PC² = e²A² + A²(1–e²) = A².  \n\nTherefore  \nI_P = I_CM + M PC² = I_CM + M A²  \n = M B³ / A + M A²  \n = M A²[ (1–e²)^{3/2} + 1 ].  (5)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.

Problem Analysis\n   • We have a very small right-circular cylinder (radius R, height h, h ≪ λ) whose axis coincides with the direction (x–axis) of an incident plane sound wave.  \n   • The wave is described in the displacement picture by  \n        ψ(x,t) = A cos (kx) cos (2πft) ,  \n     where A is the displacement amplitude, k = 2π/λ is the wave-number, and f the frequency.  \n   • We are asked for the instantaneous force F(x,t) that the sound field exerts on the cylinder along the axial direction.\n\n2. Physical Approach\n   Two equivalent linear-acoustics routes are used (they give the same result):\n   a) Surface method – compute the pressure on the two flat faces and take the difference.  \n   b) Volume (bulk) method – integrate −∇p over the cylinder’s volume.  \n   Both rely on the linear relation between the acoustic pressure perturbation p′ and the particle displacement ψ for an adiabatic ideal gas:\n\n        p′(x,t) = −γP₀ ∂ψ/∂x .           (1)\n\n   Because the cylinder is “small” (h ≪ λ) the pressure gradient can be treated as uniform across its height; that simplifies the algebra to first order in kh.\n\n3. Detailed Solution Steps\n\n   Step 1: Pressure perturbation from the wave\n   -------------------------------------------\n   Differentiate ψ with respect to x:\n\n        ∂ψ/∂x = −A k sin(kx) cos(2πft).\n\n   Insert into (1):\n\n        p′(x,t) = γP₀ A k sin(kx) cos(2πft).      (2)\n\n   Step 2: Axial pressure gradient\n   -------------------------------\n        ∂p′/∂x = γP₀ A k² cos(kx) cos(2πft).      (3)\n\n   Step 3A: Volume (bulk) evaluation of the force\n   ----------------------------------------------\n   The net force on a rigid element is (linear acoustics)\n\n        F = −∫_V ∇p dV  ≈  −(∇p) · (Volume),\n\n   keeping only first-order terms.  Using (3) and V = πR²h,\n\n        F(x,t) = −πR²h ∂p′/∂x\n                = −πR²h γP₀ A k² cos(kx) cos(2πft).         (4)\n\n   Step 3B: Surface method check\n   -----------------------------\n   • Pressure on the left face (x)  :  P₁ = P₀ + p′(x,t).  \n   • Pressure on the right face (x+h): P₂ = P₀ + p′(x+h,t).\n\n   Net axial force\n\n        F = πR² [P₁ − P₂] = πR² [p′(x,t) − p′(x+h,t)].\n\n   Taylor-expand p′(x+h,t):\n\n        p′(x+h,t) ≈ p′(x,t) + h ∂p′/∂x.\n\n   Hence\n\n        F ≈ −πR² h ∂p′/∂x,\n\n   which, with (3), reproduces expression (4).  Terms of order (kh)² have been neglected, validating the small-element assumption.\n\n   Step 4: Physical features of the result\n   ---------------------------------------\n   • Peak (amplitude) value  \n        F₀ = γP₀ A k² πR² h.  \n   • The force oscillates in time with cos(2πft) and is spatially modulated by cos(kx).  \n   • Time average over a period is zero:  ⟨F⟩ = 0 (no net radiation pressure for a purely travelling, loss-free plane wave in linear acoustics).\n\n4. Final Answer\n   The instantaneous axial force exerted on a slender cylinder of radius R and height h (h ≪ λ) by a plane sound wave whose particle displacement is ψ = A cos (kx) cos (2πft) is\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\,F(x,t)= -\\,\\pi R^{2}h\\,\\gamma P_{0}\\,A\\,k^{2}\\,\\cos(kx)\\,\\cos(2\\pi f t)\\,}.\n   \\]\n\n   Its magnitude is proportional to the cross-sectional area (πR²), the element’s length h, the ambient pressure P₀, the adiabatic index γ, and to k²A, i.e. to (2π/λ)² times the displacement amplitude."}

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

What is the subsequent change in velocity?", "solutions": "By noticing that the cutting of the magnetic field by the wire induces an electromotive force, which in turn generates Ampere force and torque, the motion state of the sphere changes. Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical.

Problem Analysis  \nA small solid sphere of initial rest–mass `m₀` is attached to the centre of an isotropic (3-D) spring whose un-stretched length is zero and whose force constant is `k`.  \nAt `t = 0` the sphere is executing a uniform circular orbit of radius `R₀`.  \nWhile it moves it sweeps through a uniform cloud (“dust”) of density `ρ`; every grain that meets the sphere sticks to it so that the rest–mass of the sphere increases but its geometric size (cross-sectional area `A`) does **not** change.  \nWe are asked to find the elapsed time `t` when the orbital radius has changed from `R₀` to some new value `R ( < R₀ )`.  \nThe given inequalities  \n\n  `R²  ≫  A` and `m₀  ≫  ρ A R`  \n\ntell us that (i) the accretion is slow (adiabatic) and (ii) the velocity never becomes highly relativistic (`v² / c² ≪ 1`), so to leading order we may put the Lorentz factor  \n\n  `γ ≃ 1 + ½ v²/c² ≈ 1`.\n\n### 2.

Problem Analysis  \nThe spacecraft move through an invisible “medium” (for instance a stream of interstellar plasma) that itself drifts with some unknown speed u relative to an inertial laboratory frame S.  \n•  In the rest–frame S′ of the medium the two craft have exactly the same speed v (also unknown).  \n•  In the laboratory frame S we measure the two speeds v₁ and v₂ and the acute angle α between their velocity vectors.  \nThe task is to find the smallest possible medium speed u compatible with the measured (v₁ , v₂ , α) once relativistic velocity–addition is taken into account.\n\n2. Approach  \nRelativistic kinematics is handled most cleanly with 4-velocities.  \n•  For any object of ordinary speed v its 4-velocity is U = γ(c, v⃗ ) with γ = 1/√(1−v²/c²).  \n•  A Lorentz transformation is a hyper-rotation in space-time; scalar products of 4-vectors are therefore invariant.  \nKey idea: in the medium rest–frame the two spacecraft are symmetric (same γ, opposite ordinary 3-velocities).  In Minkowski geometry that symmetry means the medium’s 4-velocity must be proportional to the bisector U₁ + U₂ of the two observed spacecraft 4-velocities.  Normalising that bisector gives the unique candidate for the medium 4-velocity, and its spatial component directly yields the minimum possible drift speed u.  Any other choice of medium frame would correspond to a larger relative rapidity and therefore a larger |u|.\n\n3.

Choose the medium 4-velocity  \nLet U_m be the sought 4-velocity of the medium.  If in S′ both spacecraft have equal and opposite 3-velocities (±v), their 4-velocities add to a purely timelike vector.  Transforming back to S therefore gives\n\n U_m ∝ U₁ + U₂                         (2)\n\nNormalise (U_m·U_m = c²) to obtain\n\n U_m = (U₁ + U₂)/√[(U₁ + U₂)·(U₁ + U₂)/c²]     (3)\n\nStep 4. Extract the medium’s ordinary speed u  \nWrite U₁ + U₂ = (γ₁ + γ₂)c  ê₀ + (γ₁ v₁⃗  + γ₂ v₂⃗ ).  \nThe spatial component of U_m is therefore\n\n u⃗  = c (γ₁ v₁⃗  + γ₂ v₂⃗ ) / (γ₁ + γ₂)     (4)\n\nand its magnitude is\n\n u² = c² [ γ₁² v₁² + γ₂² v₂² + 2γ₁γ₂ v₁v₂ cos α ] / (γ₁ + γ₂)²    (5)\n\nHence the candidate drift speed of the medium is  \n\n u =  c √{ γ₁² v₁² + γ₂² v₂² + 2γ₁γ₂ v₁v₂ cos α } /(γ₁ + γ₂)   (6)\n\nStep 5. Minimality of this u  \nAny other putative medium frame would correspond to a 4-velocity U′_m differing from (3).  In Minkowski space the rapidity between U₁ and U′_m plus that between U₂ and U′_m must still sum to the fixed rapidity between U₁ and U₂.  The bisector (3) is the unique vector that equalises the two partial rapidities; unequal sharing inevitably makes the larger one exceed that common value, translating into a larger ordinary speed |u′|.  Therefore the u obtained in (6) is indeed the absolute minimum compatible with the data.\n\n4.

The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center.

(1)\n        Hence\n           sin θ = √(1 – cos²θ) = √(1 – 2/3) = 1/√3 .  (2)\n\n3.  Forces acting on the top ball  \n\n   The top ball touches each of the three bottom balls at points situated\n   along the three inclined edges.  \n   Let F be the magnitude of the normal force exerted by (any one of) the\n   bottom balls on the top ball.\n\n   Vertical equilibrium of the top ball\n\n        3F cos θ  =  P       (upward normals balance the weight)    (3)\n\n   Substituting (1):\n\n        F = P /(3 cos θ) = P /(3 √(2/3)) = P /√6 .                 (4)\n\n   Horizontal component of that normal (this is the force each bottom ball\n   receives from the top ball)\n\n        F_h = F sin θ = (P /√6)(1/√3) = P /√18 = P /(3√2).         (5)\n\n   F_h acts horizontally and points from the centre of a bottom ball\n   straight away from the centroid of the triangle (i.e. “outwards”).\n\n4.  Forces acting on one bottom ball  \n\n   Choose one of the three bottom balls (call it A).  \n   The forces at the level of its centre are:\n\n   a) Rope: it is tangent to the ball at two points 120° apart.  \n      The two equal tensions T combine to a single resultant of magnitude  \n           T_R = 2T cos(120°/2) = 2T cos 60° = T                 (6)\n      directed along the bisector of the 120° angle, i.e. horizontally\n      towards the centroid of the triangle (“inwards”).\n\n   b) Horizontal component of the contact with the top ball  \n      magnitude F_h (5) acting horizontally outwards.\n\n   c) Normal forces from the other two bottom balls.  \n      Each of the neighbours pushes ball A along the line joining the two\n      centres (the sides of the equilateral triangle).  \n      Let N be the magnitude of that normal.  \n      Adding the two equal normals (60° apart) gives the resultant\n\n           N_R = 2N cos 30° = 2N (√3/2) = √3 N                 (7)\n\n      directed horizontally outwards (i.e. in the same sense as F_h).\n\n   A plan view of the forces on ball A is therefore\n\n        Inwards :  a single force  T           (rope, magnitude T)  \n        Outwards:  two forces  F_h  and  √3 N\n\n   Because the ball is at rest, the vector sum of the horizontal forces\n   must vanish; since all three resultants are collinear (radial), we can\n   write a one–dimensional equilibrium equation:\n\n        T  =  F_h  +  √3 N.                                  (8)\n\n5.  A second relation between T and N  \n\n   Now resolve the forces on the same ball along the direction of one of the\n   triangle sides (say the line that joins it to its right-hand neighbour).\n\n   •  Component of the rope resultant T along that side  \n        = T cos 60° = T (½).                                        (9a)\n\n   •  Component of F_h along the same side  \n        = F_h cos 60° = F_h (½).                                    (9b)\n      (F_h is opposite in sense to the rope component.)\n\n   •  Components of the two normals:  \n        – One normal of magnitude N acts exactly along the chosen side\n          (from the neighbour towards the ball): component –N.  \n        – The other normal of magnitude N makes 60° with the chosen side:\n          component –N cos 60° = –N/2.\n\n      The algebraic sum of the two components is therefore  –(3/2) N.       (9c)\n\n   Static equilibrium along that line of centres therefore gives\n\n        (T/2)  –  (F_h/2)  –  (3/2) N  =  0\n        ⇒     T  –  F_h  =  3 N.                                   (10)\n\n6.  Solving equations (8) and (10)\n\n   From (10):         N = (T – F_h)/3.                             (11)\n\n   Substitute (11) in (8):\n\n        T  =  F_h  +  √3 (T – F_h)/3\n        ⇒ T  =  F_h  +  (√3 /3) T  –  (√3 /3) F_h\n        ⇒ T[1 – √3 /3]  =  F_h [1 – √3 /3] .\n\n   The factor in square brackets is the same on both sides and non-zero, so\n   it can be cancelled, giving simply\n\n        T = F_h.

Problem Analysis\nThe cube (initial mass M, edge r) is released from rest at the left rim (cusp) of a cycloidal valley described by  \n\n x = R(θ−sin θ) ,  y = R(1−cos θ) ,  θ = 0 (left rim)  \n θ = π (bottom)             \n θ = 2π (right rim)  \n\nAlong the track there is a thin, uniform layer of snow of surface‐mass density σ.  \nWhenever the cube sweeps a length element dℓ of the track it “picks up’’ the strip of snow lying under its footprint r, thereby gaining an infinitesimal mass dm but having to endow it with its own instantaneous speed v.  \nNo rolling is allowed; only sliding takes place.  \nWe have to find how far up the right‐hand side the cube can climb – i.e. the largest angle θ_max (or, equivalently, the vertical rise) – keeping terms only to first order in the small parameter  \n\n ε ≡ σ r R / M  (ε ≪ 1).  \n\n### 2. Choice of Method\nBecause the accretion process is perfectly inelastic, mechanical energy is *not* conserved: each element dm that sticks at speed v removes an amount ½ dm v² from the mechanical energy of the “cube + already-stuck snow’’ system.  \nAn energy balance written *differentially* and integrated from θ = 0 to the point where the speed again becomes zero (θ = θ_max) therefore yields the desired height.\n\n### 3. Detailed Calculation\n3.1  Geometry and mass accretion  \n• Arc-length element of a cycloid  \n\n dℓ = √[(dx)²+(dy)²] = 2R sin(θ/2) dθ.  \n\n• Mass of snow gathered over dℓ  \n\n dm = σ r dℓ = 2σ r R sin(θ/2) dθ.                             (1)\n\n• Integrated extra mass up to an angle θ  \n\n Δm(θ) = ∫₀^θ dm = 4σ r R [1 − cos(θ/2)].                   (2)\n\nTo first order in ε we may still write m(θ) ≡ M + Δm(θ) ≈ M in all *leading* terms but must keep Δm wherever it multiplies the small quantity we are finally looking for.\n\n3.2  Differential energy balance  \nFor a body that *accretes* resting mass, work–energy reads\n\n d (½ m v²) + d (mgy) = −½ v² dm,                           (3)\n\n(the term on the right-hand side is the kinetic energy that must be “donated’’ to the fresh snow).  \n\nStarting from rest (θ = 0, v = 0) and stopping again (θ = θ_max, v = 0) we integrate (3):\n\n ∫_(path) ½ v² dm = (M + Δm) g y_max.               (4)\n\nThe left-hand side is the total mechanical energy *dissipated*; the right-hand side is the net loss of gravitational potential energy between the initial cusp (y = 0) and the highest point on the opposite side (y = y_max).\n\n3.3  First-order evaluation of the dissipated energy  \nBecause the dissipation itself is already first-order in ε, the *unperturbed* (σ = 0) speed suffices inside the integral:\n\n v₀²(θ) = 2g y(θ) = 2gR (1 − cos θ).                        (5)\n\nHence, using (1),\n\n D ≡ ∫_(0→θ_max) ½ v₀² dm  \n   = ∫₀^{θ_max} gR(1 − cos θ) · 2σ r R sin(θ/2) dθ           (6)\n   = 2σ r g R² ∫₀^{θ_max} (1 − cos θ) sin(θ/2) dθ.\n\nBut (1 − cos θ) = 2 sin²(θ/2); therefore\n\n D = 4σ r g R² ∫₀^{θ_max} sin³(θ/2) dθ.                      (7)\n\nPut x = θ/2, dθ = 2dx:\n\n D = 8σ r g R² ∫₀^{θ_max/2} sin³ x dx  \n   = 8σ r g R² [ −cos x + (1/3)cos³ x ]₀^{θ_max/2}.         (8)\n\nDenote α ≡ θ_max/2.  Equation (8) becomes\n\n D = 8σ r g R² [ −cos α + ⅓ cos³ α + 2/3 ].                (9)\n\n### 4. Highest Position Reached\nUsing (4) with m_f ≃ M (first order) and y_max = R(1 − cos θ_max) = 2R sin² α:\n\n M g · 2R sin² α = 8σ r g R² [ −cos α + ⅓ cos³ α + 2/3 ]. (10)\n\nBecause ε is very small the cube almost reaches the rim, hence α is close to π.  \nPut α = π − ε’ with ε’ ≪ 1 and expand:\n\n cos α = −(1 − ε’²/2) + O(ε’⁴),   sin² α = ε’² + O(ε’⁴).   (11)\n\nInsert in (10):\n\n 2M R ε’² = 8σ r R² · (8/3) + O(ε’⁴)            (12)\n\n(the ε’² terms on the right cancel, the leading constant 8/3 survives).  \nSolving for ε’,\n\n ε’² = (16/3) (σ r R / M),  ε’ = (4/√3)√(σ r R / M).      (13)\n\nHence\n\n θ_max = 2α = 2(π − ε’) = 2π − (8/√3)√(σ r R / M).         (14)\n\nVertical distance below the opposite rim:\n\n y_max = 2R sin² α = 2R ε’² = (32/3) (σ r R² / M).         (15)\n\n### 5. Discussion\n• Both the angular short-fall 2π−θ_max and the loss in height are proportional to √ε or ε, respectively, and therefore first-order in the small parameter σ r R / M.  \n• The result is independent of g (it canceled) and shows that the cube stops only slightly below the rim provided the snow layer is sufficiently light.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe cube does not quite reach the opposite cusp; it stops at the angle  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\; \\displaystyle \n\\theta_{\\max} \\simeq 2\\pi - \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}\\,\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma\\, r\\, R}{\\,M\\,}}\n\\;}\n\\]\n\ni.e. a vertical distance  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\; \\displaystyle \n\\Delta y \\;=\\; R\\!\\left(1-\\cos\\theta_{\\max}\\right)\n\\;\\simeq\\; \\frac{32}{3}\\;\n\\frac{\\sigma\\, r\\, R^{2}}{M} \\;}\n\\]\n\nbelow the rim on the right-hand side (terms retained up to first order in the small quantity σ r R ≪ M)."}

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession. Solve for its precession angular frequency $\\Omega$ (the answer can be expressed in terms of $q_{0}$ and $r_{0}$).", "solutions": "According to the problem statement, a single ideal gas under the isothermal model can satisfy the Boltzmann distribution in any continuous potential energy field distribution.
