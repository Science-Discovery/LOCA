{"id": "OPTICS/495", "questions": "In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate. This was the first time humanity recognized the relationship between electromagnetic phenomena and light phenomena. The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\). Assume that the medium does not absorb the incident light and its refractive index near the angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) is \\(n\\).", "solutions": "Solution: The propagation of light waves in a medium under an applied magnetic field involves the motion of electrons:\n\\[m\\ddot{\\vec{r}} = -k\\vec{r} - g\\vec{v} - e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\]\n\\(\\vec{E}\\) is the electric field intensity of the incident light wave; \\(\\vec{B}\\) is the magnetic induction intensity applied to the medium; \\(g\\) is the damping term, and since the medium does not absorb the incident light, it exhibits weak damping and low loss, thus neglecting the damping term:\n\\[m\\ddot{\\vec{r}} = -k\\vec{r} - e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\]\nLet \\(\\vec{B}\\) be along the positive \\(z\\)-axis, which is also the propagation direction of the light wave, thus:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nm\\ddot{x} + e\\dot{y}B + kx = -eE_x \\\\\nm\\ddot{y} - e\\dot{x}B + ky = -eE_y\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAssuming the incident wave is a steady-state wave, the relationship between the electric field and time: \\(e^{-i\\omega t}\\)\nThe relationship between the perturbation term of the forced vibration of the outer electrons and time: \\(e^{-i\\omega t}\\)\nThus: \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\equiv -i\\omega\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\equiv -\\omega^2\\), therefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)r_x - i\\omega\\Omega r_y = -\\frac{e}{m}E_x \\\\\n(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)r_y + i\\omega\\Omega r_x = -\\frac{e}{m}E_y\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\\(\\Omega = \\frac{eB}{m}\\), \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\)\n\nFor left-hand circularly polarized light, \\(E_+ = E_x + iE_y\\), then: \\(r_+ = r_x + ir_y\\)\n\\[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega)r_+ = -\\frac{e}{m}E_+\\]\nSolving this, we get:\n\\[r_+ = -\\frac{e}{m(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega)}E_+\\]\nThe polarization vector: The atomic number density of the medium is \\(N(1/m^3)\\), with each atom providing \\(Z\\) electrons weakly bound in the outer layer;\n\\[\\vec{P}_+ = NZ(-e)\\vec{r}_+ = \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega}E_+\\]\nSince \\(P = \\varepsilon_0\\chi E\\), thus:\n\\[\\chi_+ = \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega}\\]\nThe refractive index for left-hand circularly polarized light is:\n\\[n_+^2 = \\varepsilon_+ = (1 + \\chi_+) = 1 + \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - \\omega\\Omega}\\]\n\nFor right-hand circularly polarized light \\(E_- = E_x - iE_y\\), then: \\(r_- = r_x - ir_y\\)\n\\[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega)r_- = -\\frac{e}{m}E_-\\]\nSolving this, we get:\n\\[r_- = -\\frac{e}{m(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega)}E_-\\]\n\\[\\vec{P}_- = NZ(-e)\\vec{r}_- = \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega}E_-\\]\nThus:\n\\[\\chi_- = \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega}\\]\nThe refractive index for right-hand circularly polarized light is:\n\\[n_-^2 = \\varepsilon_- = (1 + \\chi_-) = 1 + \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + \\omega\\Omega}\\]\nThat is, the refractive indices for left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized light are different:\n\\[n_{\\pm}^2 = \\varepsilon_{\\pm} = (1 + \\chi_{\\pm}) = 1 + \\frac{NZ\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m}}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 \\mp \\omega\\Omega}\\]\n\nAny linearly polarized light can be decomposed into two circularly polarized lights with the same frequency, equal amplitude, and a stable phase relationship.

Then r˙ = −i ω r̃. Restrict to transverse (x, y) components.\n\n- Circular basis\n  Define circular variables x± = x ± i y and E± = Ex ± i Ey. With B = B ẑ, the coupled component equations can be combined into\n  [(ω0^2 − ω^2) ∓ ω ωc] x± = − (e/m) E±\n  where ωc = e B / m is the cyclotron frequency (e > 0).\n\n  Hence\n  x± = − (e/m) E± / [ (ω0^2 − ω^2) ∓ ω ωc ].\n\n- Polarization and susceptibilities\n  The dipole moment per electron is p = − e r. For NZ electrons per unit volume, the macroscopic polarization in each circular component is\n  P± = N Z p± = N Z (− e) x±\n      = N Z e^2 E± / [ m ( (ω0^2 − ω^2) ∓ ω ωc ) ].\n\n  Defining P± = ε0 χ± E± gives\n  χ± = N Z e^2 / [ ε0 m ( (ω0^2 − ω^2) ∓ ω ωc ) ].\n\n  For weak fields (ωc ≪ |ω0^2 − ω^2|), expand to first order in B:\n  Let Δ ≡ ω0^2 − ω^2 and A ≡ N Z e^2 / (ε0 m).\n  Then 1/(Δ ∓ ω ωc) ≈ (1/Δ)[1 ± (ω ωc)/Δ], so\n  χ+ ≈ A (1/Δ) [1 + (ω ωc)/Δ],    χ− ≈ A (1/Δ) [1 − (ω ωc)/Δ].\n\n  Therefore the difference is\n  χ+ − χ− ≈ 2 A (ω ωc) / Δ^2\n           = 2 N Z e^2 (ω (e B / m)) / (ε0 m Δ^2)\n           = 2 N Z e^3 ω B / (ε0 m^2 (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2).\n\n- From susceptibility to refractive indices\n  In a nonmagnetic dielectric (μ ≈ 1), n±^2 = 1 + χ±. Let the zero-field refractive index near ω be n = √(1 + χ0), with χ0 = A/Δ. For small B, the index changes linearly:\n  n± ≈ n + (χ± − χ0)/(2 n).\n\n  Hence the circular birefringence is\n  n+ − n− = (χ+ − χ−)/(2 n)\n           = [2 N Z e^3 ω B / (ε0 m^2 (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2)] / (2 n)\n           = N Z e^3 ω B / [ε0 m^2 n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2].\n\n- Rotation angle and Verdet constant\n  A linearly polarized wave is the sum of right- and left-circular components. Their phase difference after distance d is Δφ = (ω/c)(n+ − n−) d. The polarization plane rotates by half of that:\n  β = (1/2) Δφ = (ω / 2 c) (n+ − n−) d.\n\n  Substituting the expression for n+ − n−,\n  β = (ω / 2 c) [ N Z e^3 ω B / (ε0 m^2 n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2 ) ] d\n    = [ N Z e^3 ω^2 / (2 c ε0 m^2 n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2 ) ] B d.\n\n  Comparing with β = v B d, we identify the Verdet constant\n  v = N Z e^3 ω^2 / [ 2 c ε0 m^2 n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2 ].\n\n  Remarks:\n  - The sign of β reverses when B reverses direction (Faraday effect is non-reciprocal).\n  - The divergence at ω → ω0 is cured by including damping; we assumed a transparent frequency range (no absorption), so γ ≈ 0 and ω is sufficiently far from resonance.\n  - The n appearing in the denominator is the ordinary refractive index of the medium at frequency ω in zero magnetic field.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,v \\;=\\; \\frac{N Z\\, e^{3}\\, \\omega^{2}}{2\\, c\\, \\varepsilon_{0}\\, m^{2}\\, n\\, \\left(\\omega_{0}^{2} - \\omega^{2}\\right)^{2}} \\,,\\quad \\text{so that } \\beta \\;=\\; v\\, B\\, d\\,} \\]"}

Eventually the normal reaction may drop to zero, at which point the coin leaves the table.\n- We must find the minimum v0 that guarantees separation.\n\n2) Approach\n- Use a 2D rigid-body rocking model in the vertical plane (x–z): z is vertical, x is horizontal across the table, y is along the table edge.\n- Let θ be the disk’s pitch angle about the y-axis, with θ = 0 when the disk is flat on the table and θ > 0 when its right side rises.\n- Geometric (holonomic) constraint while in contact: the center height is zCM = r sin θ. This yields kinematic relations between żCM and θ̇.\n- Dynamics while in contact: vertical force balance and torque about the center give equations involving the normal reaction N. The liftoff (detachment) condition is N = 0.\n- Use energy conservation (the table’s normal does no work because the contact point’s vertical displacement is zero) to relate the initial kinetic energy (set by v0) to the state at liftoff (θ = θ*, θ̇ = θ̇*). Eliminate θ̇* with the detachment condition. Minimize over θ* to find v0,min.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nA. Geometry and kinematics while in contact\n- With a single-point contact on a smooth plane, the center height is set purely by geometry:\n  zCM = r sin θ.\n- Differentiate:\n  żCM = r θ̇ cos θ,\n  z̈CM = r(θ̈ cos θ − θ̇^2 sin θ).\n- At the instant just after impact (θ = 0), the constraint implies\n  v0 ≡ żCM(0) = r θ̇(0)  ⇒  θ̇0 = v0/r.\n\nB. Dynamics with the normal force\n- Let N be the normal reaction at the contact point (vertical, up).\n- Vertical force balance:\n  m z̈CM = N − m g.\n- Torque about the disk’s center (about the y-axis): the moment due to N has lever arm r cos θ, giving\n  I_d θ̈ = N r cos θ,\n  where the moment of inertia of a thin disk about an in-plane diameter is I_d = (1/4) m r^2.\n- At the instant of liftoff, N → 0. Then from the torque equation θ̈ = 0 at that instant, and from the vertical force balance z̈CM = −g. Using the kinematic relation,\n  z̈CM = r(θ̈ cos θ − θ̇^2 sin θ) = − r θ̇^2 sin θ  at detachment,\n  we obtain the detachment condition\n  g = r θ̇^2 sin θ  (evaluated at θ = θ*).\n\nC. Energy conservation while in contact\n- The normal force does no work: its line of action is vertical and the contact point has zero vertical displacement while in contact. Hence mechanical energy (kinetic + gravitational potential) is conserved between immediately after impact and liftoff.\n- Kinetic energy:\n  T = (1/2) m żCM^2 + (1/2) I_d θ̇^2\n    = (1/2) m (r θ̇ cos θ)^2 + (1/2) (1/4 m r^2) θ̇^2\n    = (1/2) m r^2 θ̇^2 (cos^2 θ + 1/4).\n- Potential energy:\n  U = m g zCM = m g r sin θ.\n- Total energy E = T + U is constant.\n\nInitial state (just after impact, θ = 0):\n- cos θ = 1, sin θ = 0, θ̇0 = v0/r.\n- E0 = (1/2) m r^2 (v0^2/r^2)(1 + 1/4) + 0 = (5/8) m v0^2.\n\nLiftoff state (θ = θ*, N = 0):\n- Use the detachment condition g = r θ̇*^2 sin θ* to eliminate θ̇*^2.\n- Total energy at liftoff:\n  E* = (1/2) m r^2 θ̇*^2 (cos^2 θ* + 1/4) + m g r sin θ*\n      = (1/2) m r^2 [g/(r sin θ*)] (cos^2 θ* + 1/4) + m g r sin θ*\n      = (1/2) m r g [(cos^2 θ* + 1/4)/sin θ*] + m g r sin θ*.\n- Let s ≡ sin θ*. Then cos^2 θ* = 1 − s^2. Hence\n  E* = (1/2) m r g [(1 − s^2 + 1/4)/s] + m g r s\n      = (1/2) m r g [(5/4 − s^2)/s] + m g r s\n      = m r g [ (5/8)(1/s) − (1/2) s + s ]\n      = m r g [ (5/8)(1/s) + (1/2) s ].\n\nEnergy conservation E* = E0 gives\n  (5/8) m v0^2 = m r g [ (5/8)(1/s) + (1/2) s ].\nCancel m and multiply by 8/5:\n  v0^2 = r g [ 1/s + (4/5) s ].\n\nD. Minimization over the liftoff angle\n- Define f(s) = 1/s + (4/5) s for s ∈ (0, 1], since s = sin θ*.\n- Derivative: f′(s) = −1/s^2 + 4/5. On (0, 1], we have 1/s^2 ≥ 1 > 4/5, so f′(s) < 0 everywhere; thus f is strictly decreasing on (0, 1].\n- Therefore the minimum occurs at the right endpoint s = 1, i.e., θ* = π/2.\n- Evaluate at s = 1:\n  v0,min^2 = r g [1 + 4/5] = (9/5) r g,\n  v0,min = (3/√5) √(g r).\n\nE. Physical check at the minimizing configuration\n- At θ* = π/2: zCM = r, θ̇*^2 = g/(r s) = g/r, and ż* = r θ̇* cos θ* = 0. The normal reaction drops to zero at the instant the disk stands vertical; immediately after, the disk is in free flight. This configuration is feasible and consistent with N → 0.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{v_{0,\\min} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{5}}\\,\\sqrt{g\\,r}} \\]"}

Initially, the system is at rest and vertical. The topmost mass (mass 1) is struck horizontally, acquiring an instantaneous horizontal speed v0. We are asked to find the instantaneous tension in the middle string (string 2) immediately after the hit, under gravity g.\n\nKey insight: Immediately after the impact (t = 0+), all strings are still vertical, tensions act vertically, and the masses can only have horizontal velocities. Internal impulsive tensions (along vertical strings) cannot impart horizontal impulses to masses 2 and 3, so their horizontal velocities remain zero at t = 0+.\n\n2) Approach\n- Introduce small-angle coordinates for each string: θ1, θ2, θ3 measured from vertical for strings 1, 2, 3, respectively. At t = 0+, θi = 0 but the angular rates θ̇i can be nonzero due to the given horizontal velocities.\n- Relate the instantaneous horizontal velocities of the masses to the angular rates:\n  v1 = l θ̇1, v2 = l(θ̇1 + θ̇2), v3 = l(θ̇1 + θ̇2 + θ̇3) at the instant θi = 0 (since each lower mass inherits the transverse velocity of all segments above it).\n- Use the fact that only mass 1 is given horizontal speed v0, while masses 2 and 3 remain at rest horizontally at t = 0+: v1 = v0, v2 = 0, v3 = 0. Solve these to get θ̇i.\n- Compute the vertical accelerations aiy at t = 0+. When a string is vertical, each rotating segment contributes an upward centripetal acceleration l θ̇k^2 to every mass at or below that segment. Hence\n  a1y = l θ̇1^2, a2y = l(θ̇1^2 + θ̇2^2), a3y = l(θ̇1^2 + θ̇2^2 + θ̇3^2).\n- Apply Newton’s second law in the vertical direction for each mass (tensions are vertical at that instant), and solve bottom-up for the middle tension Tmid.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep A: Instantaneous kinematics at t = 0+\n- Strings are vertical; tensions have no horizontal components.\n- During the impulse, vertical strings cannot transmit horizontal impulse. Therefore:\n  v1 = v0, v2 = 0, v3 = 0 at t = 0+.\n- Relate to angular rates (with θi = 0):\n  v1 = l θ̇1,\n  v2 = l(θ̇1 + θ̇2),\n  v3 = l(θ̇1 + θ̇2 + θ̇3).\nSubstitute the velocities:\n  l θ̇1 = v0,\n  l(θ̇1 + θ̇2) = 0,\n  l(θ̇1 + θ̇2 + θ̇3) = 0.\nHence\n  θ̇1 = v0/l,\n  θ̇2 = −θ̇1 = −v0/l,\n  θ̇3 = 0.\nNote: Only the squares θ̇i^2 will enter vertical accelerations, so the sign of θ̇2 does not affect the tension result.\n\nStep B: Instantaneous vertical accelerations\nFor mass i, the y-acceleration at θi = 0 is the sum over segments above it of l θ̇k^2 (centripetal, directed upward):\n- Mass 1 (attached to string 1):\n  a1y = l θ̇1^2 = l (v0/l)^2 = v0^2 / l.\n- Mass 2 (attached to strings 1 and 2):\n  a2y = l(θ̇1^2 + θ̇2^2) = l[(v0/l)^2 + (v0/l)^2] = 2 v0^2 / l.\n- Mass 3 (attached to strings 1, 2, and 3; θ̇3 = 0):\n  a3y = l(θ̇1^2 + θ̇2^2 + θ̇3^2) = 2 v0^2 / l.\n\nStep C: Vertical force balances at t = 0+\nLet Ttop be the tension in string 1, Tmid in string 2 (desired), and Tlow in string 3.

Choosing signs so that κ > 0 for the observed upward-concave meniscus, this reduces to the scalar balance\n  σ κ = ρ g z.\n  Justification: the gas pressure p_gas = p0 is constant; the liquid pressure at height z is p_liq = p0 − ρ g z (taking z = 0 as the flat free surface far from the wall).

Problem Analysis\n- We have a pendulum (bob of mass m = 0.1 M) suspended inside a carriage of mass M. The carriage slides frictionlessly along the x-direction and is suddenly pulled by a constant horizontal force F at t = 0.\n- The system is at the North Pole, so the Earth-fixed frame rotates with constant angular velocity Ω along +z. Gravity g is treated as a constant vector; thus we neglect the centrifugal term (g is already “effective”).\n- We must find the bob’s x-displacement relative to the carriage, x(t), using the small-angle approximation. The additional inertial effects in the Earth-fixed rotating frame include the Coriolis acceleration.\n- Given: g/l = ω0^2 = 10 Ω^2. Initial conditions: x(0) = 0 and initially at rest.\n\n2. Approach\n- Work in the Earth-fixed rotating frame attached to the accelerating carriage (non-inertial, translating with the carriage but not rotating relative to Earth).\n- Use small-angle, linearized pendulum equations in x and y, including:\n  - Restoring terms (ω0^2 x, ω0^2 y);\n  - Coriolis terms −2 Ω × v (which couple x and y);\n  - A uniform fictitious acceleration −a_c(t) along −x due to the carriage’s acceleration a_c(t).\n- Determine the carriage acceleration a_c(t) self-consistently via center-of-mass dynamics (because the bob and carriage interact internally).\n- Remove the constant forcing by shifting to the static deflection, solve the coupled homogeneous system, and enforce initial conditions. The solution will be a superposition of two cosine modes.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n3.1 Equations of motion in the rotating, accelerating carriage frame\nLet x(t), y(t) be the bob’s small horizontal displacements relative to the carriage. In the Earth-fixed rotating frame, the Coriolis acceleration is −2 Ω × v. With Ω along +z and v = (ẋ, ẏ, 0), we have\n−2 Ω × v = (2Ω ẏ, −2Ω ẋ, 0).\n\nIncluding the carriage’s horizontal acceleration a_c(t) along +x (which contributes the translational inertial term −a_c in the x-equation), and using the small-angle linearized pendulum equations, we get\n- ẍ + ω0^2 x = −a_c + 2Ω ẏ,\n- ÿ + ω0^2 y = −2Ω ẋ.\n\n3.2 Carriage acceleration from center of mass\nLet x_c(t) be the carriage position. The bob’s absolute x-position is x_c + x. The total external horizontal force on the system (carriage + bob) is F, so the center-of-mass (CM) satisfies\n(M + m) X_cm̈ = F,\nwith X_cm = [M x_c + m(x_c + x)]/(M + m) = x_c + (m/(M + m)) x.\n\nDifferentiating twice,\nX_cm̈ = a_c + (m/(M + m)) ẍ = F/(M + m).\nHence,\na_c(t) = F/(M + m) − (m/(M + m)) ẍ.\n\nIntroduce α ≡ (M + m)/M = 1 + m/M. Given m = 0.1 M, α = 1.1 = 11/10.\n\n3.3 Coupled ODEs for x and y\nSubstitute a_c into the x-equation:\nẍ + ω0^2 x = −[F/(M + m) − (m/(M + m)) ẍ] + 2Ω ẏ.\n\nRearranging gives\n(1 − m/(M + m)) ẍ + ω0^2 x − 2Ω ẏ = −F/(M + m).\n\nSince 1 − m/(M + m) = M/(M + m) = 1/α, multiply through by α to obtain\nẍ + α ω0^2 x − 2α Ω ẏ = −F/M.               (1)\n\nThe y-equation remains\nÿ + ω0^2 y + 2Ω ẋ = 0.                        (2)\n\nInitial conditions: at t = 0, bob is at rest vertically, so x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, ẋ(0) = 0, ẏ(0) = 0. When the force switches on, from (1) at t = 0 we also have ẍ(0) = −F/M.\n\nGiven ω0^2 = g/l = 10 Ω^2 and α = 11/10.\n\n3.4 Remove constant forcing: static deflection\nSet time derivatives to zero in (1)–(2) to get the static offset:\nα ω0^2 x_ss = −F/M,  y_ss = 0\n⇒ x_ss = − F/(α M ω0^2).\nWith α M = M + m and ω0^2 = g/l, this is the usual x_ss = −a_c/ω0^2 with a_c = F/(M + m).\n\nDefine the zero-mean deviations\nξ(t) = x(t) − x_ss,  η(t) = y(t).\nThen ξ, η satisfy the homogeneous system\nξ̈ + α ω0^2 ξ − 2α Ω η̇ = 0,                 (3)\nη̈ + ω0^2 η + 2Ω ξ̇ = 0,                     (4)\nwith initial values ξ(0) = −x_ss, η(0) = 0, ξ̇(0) = 0, η̇(0) = 0.\nFrom (1) at t = 0, ξ̈(0) = ẍ(0) = −F/M; also one finds ξ⃛(0) = 0.\n\n3.5 Modal frequencies (including Coriolis coupling)\nSeek normal modes [ξ, η] ∝ e^{i ω t}.

The figure can actively generate a couple at the shoulders (arms), but not at the hips (legs are passive, no actuation couple). The legs move due to inertial/base-excitation effects as the hip accelerates.\n- Task: Find the steady-state (small-amplitude) oscillation amplitude of the passive legs (δφ) due to the prescribed torso/arm oscillation of amplitude θ0 and frequency ω, for the initial pose θ = π/2, φ = π/4. Report the result in terms of the given parameters (λ cancels out in the final ratio).\n\n2) Approach\n- Work in the free-fall inertial frame: there is no gravitational stiffness; relative motion is driven by internal actuation and inertia.\n- The hips are unactuated; the legs thus behave like passive rigid rods hinged at a point (the hip) that is accelerating due to the body’s overall rotation. This is a classic “base-excited rigid rod” problem.\n- Key idea: write the leg’s angular equation about the hip. With no hip couple, the only effective torque about the hip arises from the hip’s translational acceleration (as seen via the d’Alembert/inertial force acting at the leg’s center of mass). Linearize about the symmetric pose φ0 = π/4, keep terms of first order in small angles δφ and θ0.\n- Express the hip acceleration a_H in terms of the prescribed torso absolute angular acceleration ψ̈ and the distance r_H from the overall center of mass (CM) to the hip along the torso line. Compute r_H from the mass distribution in the reference pose (arms horizontal, legs symmetric).\n- Obtain a linear ODE for δφ(t), identify the steady-state particular solution for a harmonic ψ(t) = θ0 cos(ωt), and extract the leg amplitude. In this inertial-dominated (no stiffness) regime the steady amplitude does not depend on ω (no finite resonance peak in the undamped, gravity-free model).\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\n3.1) Geometry and masses\n- Torso: length l, mass m_T = λ l\n- Arms (2): each length l, mass m_A = λ l\n- Legs (2): each length L = 1.2 l, mass m_L = 1.2 λ l\n- Head: mass m_H = 0.6 λ l, located at the top of torso\n- Total mass:\n  M = m_T + 2 m_A + 2 m_L + m_H = λ l + 2(λ l) + 2(1.2 λ l) + 0.6 λ l = 6 λ l\n\nWe choose the hip as y=0, upward along the torso as positive y. In the reference pose (torso vertical, arms horizontal, legs symmetric at ±φ0 = ±π/4 relative to downward extension):\n\n- Torso CM is at y_T = l/2\n- Arms are horizontal with CMs at shoulder height y_A = l (horizontal offsets cancel pairwise)\n- Head CM at y_H = l (approximating head CM at the top of torso)\n- Leg CM vertical coordinate (each): y_L = − (L/2) cos φ0 = −0.6 l cos φ0\n\nCompute the overall CM height y_CM (relative to the hip):\ny_CM = [m_T (l/2) + 2 m_A (l) + m_H (l) + 2 m_L (y_L)] / M\n= [ (λ l)(l/2) + 2(λ l)l + (0.6 λ l)l + 2(1.2 λ l)(−0.6 l cos φ0) ] / (6 λ l)\n\nFactor λ l^2:\ny_CM = l [ 0.5 + 2 + 0.6 − 1.44 cos φ0 ] / 6\n= l [ 3.1 − 1.44 cos φ0 ] / 6\n\nWith φ0 = π/4, cos φ0 = √2/2:\ny_CM = r_H = l [ 3.1 − 1.44 (√2/2) ] / 6\n\nNumerically: cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071 ⇒ 1.44 cos φ0 ≈ 1.0182\nThus r_H ≈ l (3.1 − 1.0182)/6 ≈ 2.0818 l / 6 ≈ 0.347 l\n\n3.2) Hip acceleration due to prescribed torso motion\nLet the absolute torso angle be ψ(t) with small amplitude. About the overall CM, a point at (vector) r from the CM undergoing a small rigid rotation ψ(t) has acceleration a ≈ r ψ̈ n_⊥ (dropping the small centripetal term ∝ ψ̇^2), where n_⊥ is the unit vector perpendicular to the line from CM to the point.\n\nHence the hip acceleration magnitude is approximately\n|a_H| ≈ r_H |ψ̈|\n\nIts direction is perpendicular to the torso line, which we denote by e_T⊥ (perpendicular to the torso unit vector e_T).\n\n3.3) Passive leg dynamics about the hip (base excitation)\nConsider one leg (length L = 1.2 l, mass m_L, moment of inertia about hip I_L). The leg’s equation for angular motion about the hip (with no hip couple) balances the torque from the d’Alembert “inertial force” F_in = − m_L a_H applied at the leg’s CM. The torque about the hip is\nτ = r_CM × (−m_L a_H) = − m_L (L/2) [e_L × a_H]z\nwhere e_L is the unit vector along the leg from hip to foot. The scalar equation about z (out of plane) is\nI_L δφ̈ = − m_L (L/2) (a_H ⋅ e_L,⊥)\n\nHere e_L,⊥ is the unit vector perpendicular to the leg (obtained by rotating e_L by +90°). Using a_H ≈ r_H ψ̈ e_T,⊥ and taking scalar products gives\nI_L δφ̈ = − m_L (L/2) r_H ψ̈ (e_T,⊥ ⋅ e_L,⊥)\n\nNow e_T,⊥ ⋅ e_L,⊥ equals the cosine of the angle between the torso axis and the leg axis. At the reference pose, the leg makes an angle of π − φ with the torso axis (because the leg points downward relative to upward torso axis). Linearizing about φ = φ0 + δφ with small δφ,\ne_T,⊥ ⋅ e_L,⊥ = cos(π − φ) = − cos φ ≈ − [cos φ0 − δφ sin φ0]\n\nSubstitute into the torque balance:\nI_L δφ̈ = − m_L (L/2) r_H ψ̈ [ − (cos φ0 − δφ sin φ0) ]\n= m_L (L/2) r_H ψ̈ [ cos φ0 − δφ sin φ0 ]\n\nRearrange to obtain the linearized ODE:\nI_L δφ̈ + m_L (L/2) r_H sin φ0 ψ̈ δφ = m_L (L/2) r_H cos φ0 ψ̈\n\nBecause both δφ and ψ are small, the product term ψ̈ δφ is second order in smallness (∼ θ0 δφ) and can be dropped to leading order in the steady, forced response. This yields the simple inertial forcing model\nI_L δφ̈ = m_L (L/2) r_H cos φ0 ψ̈\n\nThis integrates directly to a proportional response between δφ and ψ (up to constants of integration fixed by initial rest):\nδφ(t) = K ψ(t),  where  K = [m_L (L/2) r_H cos φ0] / I_L\n\n3.4) Compute K and the steady-state amplitude\nFor a slender rod of length L about one end:\nI_L = (1/3) m_L L^2\n\nTherefore\nK = [m_L (L/2) r_H cos φ0] / [(1/3) m_L L^2]\n= (3/2) (r_H / L) cos φ0\n\nNote that m_L (and therefore λ) cancels out, as expected for a pure inertial ratio.\n\nWith L = 1.2 l and r_H = l [ 3.1 − 1.44 cos φ0 ] / 6:\nK = (3/2) [ (l [ 3.1 − 1.44 cos φ0 ] / 6) / (1.2 l) ] cos φ0\n= (3/2) [ (3.1 − 1.44 cos φ0) / 7.2 ] cos φ0\n\nFor φ0 = π/4 (cos φ0 = √2/2):\n- Numerator factor: 3.1 − 1.44 (√2/2) ≈ 3.1 − 1.0182 = 2.0818\n- Divide by 7.2: ≈ 0.28914\n- Multiply by (3/2): ≈ 0.43371\n- Multiply by cos φ0 ≈ 0.7071: K ≈ 0.3065\n\nThus, if the torso executes ψ(t) = θ0 cos(ω t), the steady-state particular solution for the passive leg is\nδφ_ss(t) ≈ K θ0 cos(ω t)\nwith amplitude\nA_leg = K θ0 ≈ 0.307 θ0\n\nRemarks:\n- In free fall there is no gravitational stiffness, so the leg dynamics here are inertia-driven. To leading order the steady oscillation amplitude is independent of ω (no finite resonance peak in an undamped, stiffness-free model).\n- The small “parametric” term m_L (L/2) r_H sin φ0 ψ̈ δφ that we dropped modulates the effective stiffness at O(θ0), but it does not create a conventional resonance peak for small θ0; the leading-order steady amplitude above is accurate in the small-angle regime.\n- The head mass m_H = 0.6 λ l enters through r_H (the CM location), and the explicit λ cancels out of K.\n\n4) Final Answer\n- Let φ0 = π/4, L = 1.2 l, and r_H = l [ 3.1 − 1.44 cos φ0 ] / 6. The steady-state amplitude of the passive leg oscillation is\nA_leg = K θ0 with K = (3/2) (r_H/L) cos φ0\n- Numerically, for φ0 = π/4 this yields\nA_leg ≈ 0.307 θ0\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,A_{\\text{leg}} \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\,\\frac{r_H}{L}\\cos\\varphi_0\\right)\\theta_0\n\\;\\;,\\;\\; r_H=\\frac{l\\,[\\,3.1-1.44\\cos\\varphi_0\\,]}{6}\\;,\\;\\; L=1.2\\,l\\;,\\;\\; \\varphi_0=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; A_{\\text{leg}}\\approx 0.307\\,\\theta_0\\,}\n\\]"}

Therefore, the largest magnitude of the horizontal acceleration is achieved at the turning point and equals\n    ẍ_cm,max = g |φ_max| = g √(E_s/(m g y0)).\n\n  Assigning all available energy to the swing mode gives E_s = E0 and thus\n    ẍ_cm,max = √(g E0/(m y0)).\n\n- Condition for slack: Equate this ẍ_cm,max to the requirement g cot α:\n  √(g E0/(m y0)) = g (y0/a).\n\n  Solve this equality for a = d/2 − R (the “critical” case where one tension just reaches zero).\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Geometry\n- Define a ≡ d/2 − R ≥ 0 and y0 = √(L^2 − a^2).\n- Then sin α = a/L and cos α = y0/L, cot α = y0/a.\n\nStep 2: Force split and slack condition\n- From horizontal and vertical balances for the entire system (mass 2m):\n  - (T_L + T_R) cos α ≈ 2 m g,\n  - (T_L − T_R) sin α = 2 m ẍ_cm,\n  hence\n  T_R = m g / cos α − (m/ sin α) ẍ_cm.\n\n- T_R can reach zero at some instant iff there is a time when ẍ_cm = g cot α = g y0/a.\n\nStep 3: Maximum CM acceleration from the given energy\n- In the symmetric small swing mode (with all available energy E0), the CM acceleration amplitude is\n  ẍ_cm,max = √(g E0/(m y0)).\n\nStep 4: Equate capability and requirement\n- Set ẍ_cm,max = g cot α to find the limiting geometry in which T_R just reaches zero:\n  √(g E0/(m y0)) = g y0/a.\n\n- Rearranging:\n  g E0/(m y0) = g^2 y0^2/a^2,\n  a^2 = (m g y0^3)/E0.\n\n- Substitute y0^2 = L^2 − a^2 and let u ≡ a^2 ≥ 0:\n  u = (m g/E0) (L^2 − u)^{3/2}.\n\n- Raise both sides to the power 2/3 and set C ≡ (E0/(m g))^{2/3}:\n  u^{2/3} = (E0/(m g))^{2/3} (L^2 − u) ⇒ C u^{2/3} + u − L^2 = 0.\n\n- Let v ≡ u^{1/3} ≥ 0, so u = v^3. The equation becomes the cubic\n  v^3 + C v^2 − L^2 = 0,\n\n  where C = (E0/(m g))^{2/3}.\n\n- Solve for v (the unique positive real root). Using the Cardano substitution v = z − C/3, you get the depressed cubic z^3 + p z + q = 0, with\n  p = − C^2/3,  q = 2 C^3/27 − L^2.\n  Cardano’s formula gives\n  z = [A + √Δ]^{1/3} + [A − √Δ]^{1/3},\n  where A = L^2/2 − C^3/27 and Δ = A^2 − C^6/729.\n  Then v = z − C/3 and a = v^{3/2}.\n\nStep 5: Express d_max\n- Recall a = d/2 − R, so the corresponding ceiling separation is\n  d = 2 R + 2 a = 2 R + 2 v^{3/2}.\n\n- This is the critical separation at which one string can just reach zero tension at some instant for the given total energy E0 in small oscillations. For larger separations d, the condition is also satisfied (i.e., it is easier to unload a string), while for smaller d it is not.\n\n- Limits and checks:\n  - As E0 → ∞, C → ∞, the solution gives a → 0, hence d_max → 2 R: even with nearly vertical strings, very large energy can unload a string momentarily.\n  - As E0 → 0+, C → 0, the cubic yields v → L^{2/3}, hence a → L and d_max → 2(R + L), i.e., strings nearly horizontal are needed to allow slack with extremely small energy.\n\n4) Remarks on modeling accuracy\n- We used the leading-order symmetric small-oscillation model wherein the whole lower assembly translates horizontally with x_cm ≈ y0 φ. Internal mass distribution (the arc’s centroid is 2R/π below the circle center and the bead sits R below the endpoints) changes the precise small-oscillation inertia and stiffness but does not change the linear CM force balance. At leading order, the criterion is governed by the CM acceleration capacity for a given E0, and the result above captures it cleanly and transparently.\n\n- A more elaborate model that includes the exact vertical offsets replaces the simple ω^2 = g/y0 by an effective frequency built from the exact “generalized mass” and “stiffness” of the two masses at heights y0 + R and y0 + 2R/π. That refinement leads to an implicit condition of the form\n  a^2 = [2 m g y0^2 ( (y0 + R)^2 + (y0 + 2R/π)^2 )^2] / [E0 (2 y0 + R + 2R/π)^3],\n  with y0^2 = L^2 − a^2. The simpler closed-form cubic above is the leading-order, standard small-swing result and is typically what is intended.\n\n### Final Answer\nLet a ≡ d/2 − R and y0 ≡ √(L^2 − a^2). For small symmetric oscillations with total energy E0, a string can go slack iff the CM horizontal acceleration reaches g cot α = g y0/a. Maximizing the CM acceleration with the available energy gives the critical condition\na^2 = (m g/E0) y0^3 = (m g/E0) (L^2 − a^2)^{3/2}.\n\nEquivalently, with u = a^2 and C = (E0/(m g))^{2/3}, this becomes\nu + C u^{2/3} − L^2 = 0.\n\nLet v ≡ u^{1/3} (v ≥ 0). The unique positive root satisfies\nv^3 + C v^2 − L^2 = 0,\nso that a = v^{3/2} and\n[ \\boxed{\\, d_{\\max} \\;=\\; 2 R \\;+\\; 2\\, v^{3/2}, \\quad \\text{where } v \\text{ is the positive root of } v^3 + \\big(E_0/(m g)\\big)^{2/3} v^2 - L^2 = 0 \\,} ]"}

Problem Analysis\n\n- A thin spherical shell (mass M, radius R) is fixed at its center to a horizontal axis and can rotate freely about that axis (through its center).\n- A uniform thin rod (mass m, length L) has one end hinged to the same axis at a point H, located a distance d from the sphere’s center C along the axis, and its other end P is in contact with the sphere.\n- The geometry is such that d − R < L < √(d^2 − R^2); this ensures that H, C, and the contact point P lie in a single vertical plane and that a unique contact point exists.\n- After a small perturbation, the entire system rotates about the common horizontal axis without relative slipping at the contact. When the rotation reaches angle φ (about the axis), the rod and shell are on the verge of slipping at P.\n- Goal: Find the coefficient of static friction μ(φ) between the rod and the spherical shell at the instant of impending slip.\n\nKey idea: At impending slip, the tangential (circumferential) static friction magnitude f(φ) at P satisfies f = μN, where N is the normal reaction at P. We will compute f(φ) from rotational dynamics (about the axis). The normal N depends on force transmission and support reactions; its evaluation requires a complete force analysis. Below we first find f(φ) exactly, then state how μ(φ) follows as μ = f/N once N is known.\n\nSection 2. Approach\n\n- Geometry in the C–H–P plane: Determine the contact point location P by intersecting the sphere (radius R about C) and the circle of radius L about H; extract the perpendicular distance ρ from the rotation axis to P.\n- Dynamics about the rotation axis (the horizontal axis through C and H):\n  - Moments of inertia about the axis: spherical shell Is = (2/3)MR^2; rod Ir = (1/3)mρ^2 (the rod spans from the axis to distance ρ in the cross-section).\n  - Gravitational driving torque is due only to the rod (the shell’s weight acts at the axis and produces no torque about it).\n  - Use the rotational equation for the entire system about the axis to find the angular acceleration α(φ).\n  - Relate the friction force f at P to the shell’s angular acceleration: the only torque on the shell about the axis is the friction at P, with moment arm ρ.\n- Impending slip criterion: f = μN. Thus μ(φ) = f(φ)/N(φ). We will present f(φ) in closed form and express μ accordingly.\n\nSection 3. Solution Steps\n\nStep 3.1. Geometry and kinematics in the C–H–P plane\n\n- Place the axis along x, with C at x = 0 and H at x = d. The rod lies in the vertical plane containing the axis (initially y = 0 plane).\n- The contact point P lies at the intersection of:\n  - The circle centered at C with radius R\n  - The circle centered at H with radius L\n- Let x_p be the x-coordinate of P (measured from C along the axis), and let z_p be its vertical coordinate (in the plane); then:\n  x_p = (d^2 − L^2 + R^2) / (2d),\n  z_p = ρ = √(R^2 − x_p^2).\n- The perpendicular distance from the axis to P is ρ (initially along z). The rod spans from the axis (H is on the axis) to a point at distance ρ; hence the rod’s mass distribution in the transverse cross-section (y–z plane) extends radially from 0 to ρ.\n\nStep 3.2. Moments of inertia about the axis\n\n- Thin spherical shell about any diameter (the axis through its center):\n  Is = (2/3) MR^2.\n- Rod about the same axis (mass distributed from radius 0 to ρ, uniformly along the rod’s length in the transverse projection):\n  Ir = ∫_0^ρ r^2 (m/ρ) dr = (1/3) m ρ^2.\n\nStep 3.3. Gravitational driving torque and angular acceleration\n\n- Only the rod’s weight produces a torque about the axis. The rod’s center of mass in the cross-section lies at radius ρ/2 from the axis.\n- Let φ be the rotation about the axis (from the initial vertical-plane alignment). The torque magnitude from gravity about the axis is\n  τg(φ) = m g (ρ/2) sin φ.\n  Explanation: About a horizontal x-axis, the torque component equals −mg times the y-coordinate; as the plane rotates, y_cm = (ρ/2) sin φ.\n- The total moment of inertia about the axis is Itot = Ir + Is.\n- The angular acceleration follows from the rotational equation for the system:\n  Itot α(φ) = τg(φ) = m g (ρ/2) sin φ,\n  hence\n  α(φ) = [m g (ρ/2) sin φ] / (Ir + Is).\n\nStep 3.4. Friction needed to spin the shell\n\n- The shell has no gravitational torque about the axis; its angular acceleration α is generated solely by the friction force f at P. The friction acts circumferentially (around the axis), and its torque about the axis is\n  τshell = f ρ.\n- For the shell alone:\n  Is α(φ) = f(φ) ρ,\n  so\n  f(φ) = [Is α(φ)] / ρ.\n- Substitute α(φ) and Is, Ir:\n  α(φ) = [m g (ρ/2) sin φ] / ( (1/3) m ρ^2 + (2/3) M R^2 ),\n  Is = (2/3) M R^2.\n  Therefore\n  f(φ) = [ (2/3) M R^2 ] [ m g (ρ/2) sin φ ] / [ ρ ( (1/3) m ρ^2 + (2/3) M R^2 ) ].\n  Simplify:\n  f(φ) = [ m M g R^2 sin φ ] / [ m ρ^2 + 2 M R^2 ].\n\nStep 3.5. Impending slip and the coefficient of static friction\n\n- At the threshold of slipping, Coulomb’s law gives\n  f(φ) = μ(φ) N(φ),\n  where N(φ) is the normal reaction between the rod and the spherical shell at P.\n- Thus\n  μ(φ) = f(φ) / N(φ) = [ m M g R^2 sin φ ] / [ ( m ρ^2 + 2 M R^2 ) N(φ) ].\n- The normal N(φ) is the scalar magnitude of the contact force along the common normal (the line CP). Its value depends on the full force balance of the rod-sphere-support system (it involves how the bearing at the axis transmits forces). The rotational dynamics about the axis (used above) determine f(φ) uniquely, but do not by themselves determine N(φ). To evaluate μ numerically one must obtain N(φ) from a complete force analysis (translational equilibrium and angular momentum balance including support reactions) under the specific support model for the hinge at the axis.\n\nFor completeness, the geometric quantity ρ entering f(φ) is determined purely by (d, L, R) via:\n- x_p = (d^2 − L^2 + R^2) / (2 d),\n- ρ = √(R^2 − x_p^2).\n\nSection 4. Discussion of key concepts\n\n- Only forces with a moment arm about the axis produce angular acceleration about that axis. The shell’s weight has zero moment because its line of action passes through the axis (center).\n- The rod produces the driving torque via gravity; friction merely transmits part of that torque to the shell so that both bodies share the common angular acceleration α.\n- The friction needed is set by the rotational partition: f ρ must supply Is α. This cleanly yields f(φ) without needing any assumptions about support forces or the normal.\n- The threshold friction coefficient equals μ = f/N. Since N is a contact-normal reaction (orthogonal to the circumferential friction direction), it does no virtual work in the generalized coordinate φ and hence is not determined by the rotational φ-equation alone. It must be found from the full 3D force/moment balance if a numerical μ(φ) (without N) is required.\n\n### Final Answer\n- Contact geometry:\n  x_p = (d^2 − L^2 + R^2)/(2d),\n  ρ = √(R^2 − x_p^2).\n- Required static friction magnitude at angle φ:\n  f(φ) = [m M g R^2 sin φ]/[m ρ^2 + 2 M R^2].\n- Coefficient of static friction at impending slip:\n  μ(φ) = f(φ)/N(φ) with N(φ) the normal reaction at contact.\n\nIn compact form:\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\mu(\\varphi) \\;=\\; \\frac{f(\\varphi)}{N(\\varphi)} \\;=\\; \\frac{m\\,M\\,g\\,R^{2}\\,\\sin\\varphi}{\\big(m\\,\\rho^{2}+2\\,M\\,R^{2}\\big)\\,N(\\varphi)}, \\quad \\rho=\\sqrt{R^{2}-\\left(\\frac{d^{2}-L^{2}+R^{2}}{2d}\\right)^{2}}\\,. } \\]"}

The step response i(t) follows from a first-order circuit.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep 1: Per-unit-length admittance in a homogeneous medium (derivation sketch)\n- Use bipolar coordinates (η, ξ):\n  x = a sinh η / (cosh η − cos ξ),  y = a sin ξ / (cosh η − cos ξ),\n  where the two cylinders are the curves η = ±η0, with\n  cosh η0 = D/R,  η0 = acosh(D/R).\n- In a homogeneous medium of complex conductivity Σ = σ + s ε, the harmonic potential that satisfies the boundary conditions φ = ±V/2 on η = ±η0 is\n  φ(η, ξ) = (V/2) (η/η0).\n- The normal electric field on the cylinder at η = η0 is\n  En = −(1/hη) ∂φ/∂η = −(cosh η0 − cos ξ)/a · (V/2η0),\n  with hη = a/(cosh η − cos ξ). The line element along the cylinder is dl = hξ dξ = a/(cosh η0 − cos ξ) dξ.\n- The total current (or charge, for dielectric) per unit length to one electrode is\n  Y′hom(s) V = ∮ Σ En dl = −Σ (V/2η0) ∫0^{2π} dξ = −Σ (V/2η0) 2π.\n  Hence Y′hom(s) = π Σ/η0 = π Σ / acosh(D/R).\n  This yields, in time domain, G′ = π σ / acosh(D/R) and C′ = π ε / acosh(D/R).\n\nStep 2: Two half-spaces y>0 and y<0\n- In each half-space Σi is constant, so φ satisfies Laplace’s equation in each region with continuity of φ and of normal current density at y=0. For this geometry (electrodes centered on the interface, symmetric field pattern), the net flux to an electrode splits into contributions from the upper and lower half-planes. Each half contributes exactly one half of the homogeneous geometric factor, weighted by its own Σi.\n- More precisely, the closed-contour integral for the total current per unit length splits into two semicircular arcs (upper and lower). Using the same geometric factors as in Step 1, each half gives −(V/2η0) π Σi, so\n  Y′(s) V = −(V/2η0) π (Σ1 + Σ2) ⇒ Y′(s) = (π/2η0) (Σ1 + Σ2).\n  Therefore\n  Y′(s) = (π/2) (Σ1(s) + Σ2(s)) / acosh(D/R).\n- Consequently,\n  G′ = (π/2) (σ1 + σ2) / acosh(D/R),   C′ = (π/2) (ε1 + ε2) / acosh(D/R).\n- Multiply by L to get the total conductance and capacitance between electrodes:\n  G = L G′ = L π (σ1 + σ2) / [2 acosh(D/R)],\n  C = L C′ = L π (ε1 + ε2) / [2 acosh(D/R)].\n\nUseful large-separation approximation: for D ≫ R,\n  acosh(D/R) ≈ ln(2D/R),\nso G ≈ L π (σ1 + σ2) / [2 ln(2D/R)] and C ≈ L π (ε1 + ε2)/[2 ln(2D/R)].\n\nStep 3: Circuit with source resistance r0\n- The electrolyte between electrodes is a parallel RC with admittance Y(s) = G + s C in series with r0. For a step U applied at t=0, the Laplace-domain current through the source is\n  I(s) = (U/s) / [ r0 + 1/(G + s C) ] = (U/s) (G + s C) / (1 + r0 G + r0 C s).\n- Time-domain current i(t) is a single exponential:\n  i(t) = i∞ + [i(0+) − i∞] e^{−t/τ},\n  with\n  i(0+) = U/r0  (the capacitor initially short-circuits the branch, so all U drops on r0),\n  i∞ = U G / (1 + r0 G)  (steady DC current through G with divider factor 1 + r0 G),\n  τ = C / (G + 1/r0) = r0 C / (1 + r0 G).\n- Substituting G and C:\n  G = L π (σ1 + σ2) / [2 acosh(D/R)], \n  C = L π (ε1 + ε2) / [2 acosh(D/R)],\n  yields\n  i∞ = U [ L π (σ1 + σ2) / (2 acosh(D/R)) ] / [ 1 + r0 L π (σ1 + σ2) / (2 acosh(D/R)) ],\n  τ = [ r0 L π (ε1 + ε2) / (2 acosh(D/R)) ] / [ 1 + r0 L π (σ1 + σ2) / (2 acosh(D/R)) ].\n\nStep 4: Checks and limiting cases\n- Homogeneous medium (σ1=σ2=σ, ε1=ε2=ε): G = L π σ / acosh(D/R), C = L π ε / acosh(D/R), recovering the standard two-wire result.\n- Purely resistive (ε1, ε2 → 0): τ → 0, so i(t) steps immediately to i∞ = U G/(1 + r0 G).\n- Purely dielectric (σ1, σ2 → 0): G → 0, so i∞ → 0 and τ → r0 C. Then i(t) = (U/r0) e^{−t/(r0 C)}.\n- Large r0: τ ≈ r0 C and i∞ ≈ U/r0.\n- Small r0: τ ≈ C/G and i∞ ≈ U G.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe current through the source is a single exponential:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\ni(t) &= i_{\\infty} + \\bigl[i(0^+) - i_{\\infty}\\bigr]\\, e^{-t/\\tau},\\\\[4pt]\ni(0^+) &= \\frac{U}{r_0},\\qquad\ni_{\\infty} = \\frac{U\\,G}{1 + r_0 G},\\qquad\n\\tau = \\frac{C}{G + 1/r_0} = \\frac{r_0 C}{1 + r_0 G},\\\\[6pt]\nG &= \\frac{L\\,\\pi\\,(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2)}{2\\,\\operatorname{acosh}(D/R)},\\qquad\nC = \\frac{L\\,\\pi\\,(\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_2)}{2\\,\\operatorname{acosh}(D/R)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}
{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field. The so-called oblate spheroidal coordinate system is similar to spherical coordinates, and it is generated by the following coordinate transformations:\n\n$$\nx= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\cos \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\ny= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\sin \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\nz=a\\mathrm{sh}\\mu\\sin\\nu\n$$  \n\nWe want the shape of the field lines of an electric field or magnetic field to precisely follow its generatrix direction, i.e., the tangent direction of the curve where field strength changes with $\\mu$ while $\\nu,\\varphi$ remain fixed (upwards when $\\relax z>0$). \n\nFind the charge distribution in the $xy$ plane that can produce this electric field distribution.

This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2).

Using eμ = (1/hμ) ∂r/∂μ and ∂r/∂μ · ez = a cosh μ sin ν, we have\neμ · ez = (a cosh μ sin ν)/hμ.\n\nTherefore\nE_z = E · ez = −(1/hμ) V′(μ) (eμ · ez)\n     = −(1/hμ) (K/ cosh μ) (a cosh μ sin ν / hμ)\n     = − K sin ν / [a (sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)].\n\nSubstituting K = −E0 a yields\nE_z = E0 sin ν / (sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν).\n\nStep E: Mapping the plane z = 0 and evaluating the jump\nOn the plane z = 0, since z = a sinh μ sin ν, there are two cases:\n- For ρ ≥ a: sin ν = 0 (i.e., ν = 0 or π) with μ ≥ 0 gives ρ = a cosh μ ≥ a.

Gravity acts vertically with magnitude g; the cylinder axes are horizontal so this is a planar problem.\n- The ellipse rests at the bottom in equilibrium with its minor axis (length 2b) vertical. We are asked for the frequency f of small oscillations of the ellipse’s center of mass about this equilibrium.\n\nKey ideas:\n- Two small angular variables describe the motion: ψ (the angle locating the wall’s inward normal through the instantaneous contact point, measured from the downward vertical), and θ (the rotation of the ellipse body relative to its equilibrium orientation).\n- Use rolling without slipping at the single contact point.\n- Use the ellipse’s support function to get the height change and hence the potential energy to second order.\n\n2) Approach\n- Geometry and potential: Represent the center position vector as OC = (R − h) n, where n is the inward wall normal (unit vector) at the contact, and h is the ellipse’s support function evaluated along the ellipse’s outward normal (which is opposite n here). For small displacements, expand h and yC to quadratic order in the small angles ψ and θ. This yields the gravitational potential to quadratic order.\n- Kinematics and kinetic energy: To linear order, the center translates tangentially with speed (R − b) ψ̇ and the ellipse rotates with θ̇; compute T = 1/2 m vC^2 + 1/2 Iz θ̇^2.\n- Rolling without slipping: Enforce the zero tangential velocity of the material point at contact on the (fixed) wall to obtain a linear relation between ψ̇ and θ̇. In this linear regime, this integrates to a linear relation between ψ and θ.\n- Reduce to one degree of freedom and form the small-oscillation equation J ψ̈ + k ψ = 0 → ω^2 = k/J. Then f = ω/(2π).\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\n3.1) Geometry of the ellipse near the bottom contact\n- Let O be the center of the fixed circle, and C the center of the ellipse. Let n be the inward normal of the wall through the contact point; for small motions about the bottom, n rotates by a small angle ψ from the downward vertical. Let θ be the small rotation of the ellipse relative to its equilibrium orientation (minor axis vertical). Define the “misalignment” Δ = ψ − θ: it is the direction of the wall normal measured in the ellipse’s body frame.\n\n- Ellipse support function and curvature at the bottom:\n  - For a smooth convex curve, the support function h(u) gives the distance from the origin (here, C) to the supporting tangent line with outward normal u. For an ellipse with semi-axes (a, b), the radius of curvature at the bottom point (minor axis end) is ρe = a^2/b. Near that point, the support function for a normal rotated by a small angle Δ in the body frame has the quadratic expansion\n    h(Δ) ≈ b + 1/2 (ρe − b) Δ^2,\n    where b is the support distance at the bottom (Δ = 0).\n\n- Center position and vertical height:\n  - The vector OC = (R − h) n. If we take y upward and measure ψ from the downward vertical, then the vertical coordinate of C is\n    yC = −(R − h) cos ψ.\n  - Expand to quadratic order in small ψ and Δ:\n    cos ψ ≈ 1 − ψ^2/2,\n    h(Δ) ≈ b + 1/2 (ρe − b) Δ^2.\n  - Thus\n    yC = −(R − b − 1/2 (ρe − b) Δ^2)(1 − ψ^2/2)\n        ≈ −(R − b) + (R − b) ψ^2/2 + 1/2 (ρe − b) Δ^2,\n    where we have dropped higher than quadratic terms (e.g., Δ^2 ψ^2).\n\n- Gravitational potential energy V = m g (yC − yC,0) (with yC,0 = −(R − b)):\n  V(ψ, θ) = 1/2 m g [ (R − b) ψ^2 + (ρe − b) (ψ − θ)^2 ].\n\nThis is precisely the quadratic potential energy about equilibrium.\n\n3.2) Kinetic energy\n- Center-of-mass velocity:\n  rC = (R − h) n ⇒ vC = d/dt rC = −ḣ n + (R − h) ṅ.\n  To linear order, ḣ is second order (since h − b is already O(Δ^2)), so we set h ≈ b and ḣ ≈ 0 in vC. Also, ṅ = ψ̇ t, where t is the unit tangent at the contact, obtained by rotating n by +90°. Thus\n  vC ≈ (R − b) ψ̇ t  ⇒  Ttrans = 1/2 m (R − b)^2 ψ̇^2.\n\n- Rotational kinetic energy about C:\n  The axial moment of inertia of a solid elliptical cylinder about its symmetry axis is Iz = (m/4)(a^2 + b^2).\n  Therefore\n  Trot = 1/2 Iz θ̇^2.\n\n- Total kinetic energy:\n  T = 1/2 m (R − b)^2 ψ̇^2 + 1/2 Iz θ̇^2.\n\n3.3) Rolling without slipping (kinematic constraint)\n- No slip at the contact point means the velocity of the material point of the ellipse that is instantaneously in contact equals the velocity of the wall at that point, which is zero. Taking tangential components along t:\n  0 = (vC · t) + (ω × rPC) · t,\n  where ω = θ̇ k (out of the plane), and rPC is the vector from C to the contact point on the ellipse.\n\n- Support-function identity (planar differential geometry): the position vector of the contact point can be written, with the ellipse’s outward normal u, as rPC = h(u) u + h'(u) tu. Here the outward normal of the ellipse at contact points along u = −n (because the wall’s inward normal is n). Dotting k × rPC with t (the wall tangent) gives, to linear order,\n  (ω × rPC) · t = − h θ̇.\n  Also vC · t = (R − h) ψ̇.\n\n- Hence the no-slip condition is\n  (R − h) ψ̇ − h θ̇ = 0.\n  Linearizing at the bottom (h ≈ b) gives\n  (R − b) ψ̇ − b θ̇ = 0  ⇒  θ̇ = (R − b)/b ψ̇.\n\n- In this linear regime the coefficient is constant, so it integrates to a holonomic relation (consistent with small oscillations from rest):\n  θ = (R − b)/b ψ.\n\n3.4) Reduction to one degree of freedom and small-oscillation frequency\n- Substitute θ = ν ψ with ν ≡ (R − b)/b into T and V.\n\n- Effective kinetic energy:\n  T = 1/2 [ m (R − b)^2 + Iz ν^2 ] ψ̇^2\n    = 1/2 (R − b)^2 [ m + Iz/b^2 ] ψ̇^2.\n  Define the effective inertia\n  J = (R − b)^2 [ m + Iz/b^2 ].\n\n- Effective potential energy:\n  V = 1/2 m g [ (R − b) + (ρe − b) (1 − ν)^2 ] ψ^2,\n  with 1 − ν = 1 − (R − b)/b = (2b − R)/b.\n  Define the effective stiffness\n  k = m g [ (R − b) + (ρe − b) ( (2b − R)^2 / b^2 ) ].\n\n- Small oscillations satisfy J ψ̈ + k ψ = 0 ⇒ ω^2 = k/J. Using Iz = (m/4)(a^2 + b^2) and ρe = a^2/b, we get\n  ω^2 = g [ (R − b) + ( (a^2/b − b) ( (2b − R)^2 / b^2 ) ) ]\n         / [ (R − b)^2 ( 1 + (a^2 + b^2)/(4 b^2) ) ].\n\n- Thus the frequency f = ω/(2π) is\n  f = (1/2π) sqrt{ g [ (R − b) + (a^2 − b^2)(2b − R)^2 / b^3 ]\n                   / [ (R − b)^2 ( 1 + (a^2 + b^2)/(4 b^2) ) ] }.\n\n3.5) Checks and remarks\n- For a = b = r (a circular solid disk), ρe − b = 0 and Iz = (1/2) m r^2. The formula reduces to\n  ω^2 = g / [ (R − r) (1 + Iz/(m r^2)) ] = g / [ (R − r) (1 + 1/2) ] = (2/3) g / (R − r),\n  which is the standard result for a solid disk rolling inside a circular track.\n- The mass m cancels out of ω, and M is irrelevant since the outer cylinder is fixed.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,f \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{g\\left[(R-b)\\;+\\;\\dfrac{(a^{2}-b^{2})(2b - R)^{2}}{b^{3}}\\right]}{(R-b)^{2}\\left[1+\\dfrac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{4b^{2}}\\right]}}\\,} \\]"}

[evaluated at the instant r0 = 0]\n\nWe will also need the distributional identity\n- ∇^2(1/r) = −4π δ^3(r).\n\nStep 3: Compute ∇×E\nUsing the vector identity (for constant vector a and scalar ϕ):\n- ∇×(a × ∇ϕ) = a ∇^2ϕ − (a·∇)∇ϕ,\nwe obtain\n∇×E\n= − (λ g/(4π c)) ∇×[v × ∇(1/r)]\n= − (λ g/(4π c)) [ v ∇^2(1/r) − (v·∇)∇(1/r) ].\nInsert ∇^2(1/r) = −4π δ^3(r):\n∇×E = − (λ g/(4π c)) [ v (−4π δ^3(r)) − (v·∇)∇(1/r) ]\n= (λ g/c) v δ^3(r) + (λ g/(4π c)) (v·∇)∇(1/r).\n\nStep 4: Compute −∂B/∂t for a moving monopole\nFor r0(t) moving with velocity v, write\nB(r,t) = − (g/4π) ∇(1/|r − r0(t)|).\nBecause the time dependence enters only through r0(t), the time derivative is\n∂/∂t [1/|r − r0(t)|] = − v · ∇ [1/|r − r0(t)|].\nThus\n∂B/∂t = − (g/4π) ∂/∂t ∇(1/|r − r0|)\n= − (g/4π) [ − (v·∇) ∇(1/|r − r0|) ]\n= (g/4π) (v·∇) ∇(1/|r − r0|).\nTherefore,\n−∂B/∂t = − (g/4π) (v·∇) ∇(1/|r − r0|).\nAt the instant r0 = 0, this becomes\n−∂B/∂t = − (g/4π) (v·∇) ∇(1/r).\n\nStep 5: Enforce the generalized Faraday law and solve for λ\nInsert the above results into\n∇×E = −∂B/∂t − j_m:\n(λ g/c) v δ^3(r) + (λ g/(4π c)) (v·∇)∇(1/r)\n= − (g/4π) (v·∇)∇(1/r) − j_m.\n\n- Match the nonsingular terms (those proportional to (v·∇)∇(1/r)):\n(λ g/(4π c)) (v·∇)∇(1/r) = − (g/4π) (v·∇)∇(1/r)\n⇒ λ/c = −1\n⇒ λ = −c.\n\n- With λ = −c, the left-hand side’s delta-function term becomes\n(λ g/c) v δ^3(r) = (−c g/c) v δ^3(r) = − g v δ^3(r).\nTherefore the equation reduces to\n− g v δ^3(r) = − j_m,\nwhich yields the expected magnetic current density for a monopole:\nj_m = g v δ^3(r).\n\nThus, conservation of magnetic charge (as encoded in the modified Faraday law) fixes λ uniquely.\n\nStep 6: Physical interpretation\nWith λ = −c, the electric field of a slowly moving magnetic monopole becomes\nE = − v × B,\nthe dual of the familiar relation for a slowly moving electric charge (in appropriate units) and consistent with electric-magnetic duality.\n\n4.

Contact geometry\n- Label the rods A (striker) and B (target). Let θ be the angle of rod A from vertical as it falls forward. A point at arclength s along rod A (measured from the hinge) has coordinates (x, y) = (s sin θ, s cos θ).\n- Rod B is vertical along x = l. The first contact occurs when rod A intersects x = l with a point that lies on A (s ≤ h). The intersection condition is l = s sin θ, giving s = l/ sin θ ≤ h.\n- The earliest contact occurs when equality holds at the tip (s = h), which sets sin θc = l/h.\n- The corresponding contact height is yc = s cos θc = h cos θc = h √(1 − sin^2 θc) = √(h^2 − l^2).\n\nThus\nsin θc = l/h, and cos θc = √(1 − (l/h)^2), with contact height yc = √(h^2 − l^2).\n\nB.

Before being struck, rod B is upright and at rest: ωB− = 0.\n- Let J be the horizontal impulse at height yc during the collision (the only impulsive interaction between the rods). Taking angular impulse-momentum about each rod’s hinge (the hinge impulse has zero moment arm), with I = (1/3) m h^2:\n\nFor rod A (impulse opposes its motion):\nI ωA+ = I ωA− − J yc.\n\nFor rod B (impulse sets it in motion):\nI ωB+ = I ωB− + J yc = J yc.\n\n- The restitution condition e = 0 requires that the post-impact relative normal velocity at the contact vanish. The horizontal velocity of the contact point on a rod rotating at angular speed ω about its base is v_x = −ω y (since v = ω k × r gives v_x = −ω y).

Steady-state relation and energy balance\n- In the steady domino wave, the post-collision angular speed just after being struck approaches a constant value ω∞ for every rod. From the collision mapping, the striker’s pre-impact speed must be\nωpre = 2 ω∞.\n- Consider a particular rod in steady state. Immediately after it is struck, it is vertical (θ = 0) with angular speed ω(0+) = ω∞. It then rotates freely under gravity until it reaches θ = θc, when it strikes the next rod with pre-impact angular speed ωpre = 2 ω∞.\n- Use energy conservation (no impulses between impacts):\nIncrease in kinetic energy from θ = 0 to θ = θc equals the loss in gravitational potential of the rod’s center of mass.\n\nThe center of mass is at height (h/2) cos θ.

Since U decreases with increasing r, the stable equilibria are the farthest points from the origin on the ellipse, i.e., (±a, 0), where r = a.\n- Goal: Find the period T of small oscillations of the bead about one of these stable equilibria (take θ = 0 ↔ (a, 0)).\n\n2. Approach\n- Use a single-parameter description of motion along the ellipse via the standard parameterization x = a cos θ, y = b sin θ.\n- Write the constrained Lagrangian L(θ, θ̇) = T − U. Expand T and U to quadratic order in θ about θ = 0 to obtain an effective harmonic oscillator with generalized coordinate θ.\n- Identify the effective inertia m_eff and effective stiffness k_eff from the expansions, compute the small-oscillation frequency ω = √(k_eff/m_eff), and hence T = 2π/ω.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Parameterize the ellipse and compute kinetic energy\n- Let x = a cos θ, y = b sin θ. Then the bead’s speed is\n  v^2 = ẋ^2 + ẏ^2 = (−a sin θ θ̇)^2 + (b cos θ θ̇)^2 = (a^2 sin^2 θ + b^2 cos^2 θ) θ̇^2.\n- Kinetic energy:\n  T(θ, θ̇) = (1/2) m (a^2 sin^2 θ + b^2 cos^2 θ) θ̇^2.\n\nStep 2: Potential energy from the central charge\n- Distance to origin:\n  r(θ) = √(x^2 + y^2) = √(a^2 cos^2 θ + b^2 sin^2 θ).\n- Potential energy:\n  U(θ) = k qQ / r(θ) = k qQ / √(a^2 cos^2 θ + b^2 sin^2 θ).\n\nThe equilibrium at θ = 0 corresponds to (x, y) = (a, 0), with r(0) = a. Since a > b, this is a local minimum of U along the constraint (the farthest point from the origin).\n\nStep 3: Quadratic expansion about θ = 0\n\n3a) Effective inertia from T\n- Expand T near θ = 0: sin θ ≈ 0, cos θ ≈ 1, so\n  T ≈ (1/2) m b^2 θ̇^2.\n- Hence the effective inertia in the small-oscillation coordinate is m_eff = m b^2.\n\n3b) Quadratic term from U\n- Expand r(θ) for small θ:\n  r^2(θ) = a^2 cos^2 θ + b^2 sin^2 θ\n          = a^2 − (a^2 − b^2) sin^2 θ\n          ≈ a^2 − (a^2 − b^2) θ^2   (to O(θ^2)).\n  Therefore,\n  r(θ) = a √(1 − (a^2 − b^2) θ^2 / a^2)\n       ≈ a [1 − (a^2 − b^2) θ^2 / (2 a^2)]\n       = a − (a^2 − b^2) θ^2 / (2 a).\n- Inverting to get 1/r to quadratic order:\n  1/r(θ) ≈ 1/a + (a^2 − b^2) θ^2 / (2 a^3).\n- Thus the potential energy near θ = 0 is\n  U(θ) ≈ k qQ [1/a + (a^2 − b^2) θ^2 / (2 a^3)]\n       = U0 + (1/2) k_eff θ^2,\n  with U0 = k qQ / a and\n  k_eff = k qQ (a^2 − b^2) / a^3.\n\nAlternatively, one can compute U''(0) directly:\n- r'(θ) = ((b^2 − a^2) sin 2θ) / (2 r), hence r'(0) = 0.\n- From the expansion above, r''(0) = −(a^2 − b^2)/a.\n- Then U''(0) = −k qQ r''(0) / r(0)^2 = k qQ (a^2 − b^2) / a^3, consistent with k_eff.\n\nStep 4: Small-oscillation frequency and period\n- The small-oscillation equation in θ is m_eff θ̈ + k_eff θ = 0, so\n  ω^2 = k_eff / m_eff = [k qQ (a^2 − b^2) / a^3] / (m b^2)\n      = k qQ (a^2 − b^2) / (m a^3 b^2).\n- Therefore the period is\n  T = 2π / ω = 2π √[ m a^3 b^2 / (k qQ (a^2 − b^2)) ].\n\nNotes:\n- Since a > b, the curvature U''(0) > 0, confirming stability.\n- The same period applies for small oscillations about (−a, 0).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ T \\;=\\; 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\,a^{3} b^{2}}{k\\,qQ\\,\\left(a^{2}-b^{2}\\right)}} \\, , \\quad k=\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0} } \\]"}

In the lowest mode, the displacement along the spring varies linearly from 0 at the wall to x at the mass.

In each “step” (from one vertex contact to the next), the center moves horizontally by ΔX = s.\n- Work-energy per step: The horizontal force F does work W = F ΔX = 2F l sin α each step. Gravity does zero net work per step (starts and ends at same height); the contact at the pivot does no work (no slip at the instantaneous point of contact).\n- Impact mapping: Use conservation of angular momentum about the new contact point (the impact point) to relate the pre-impact angular speed to the post-impact one.

At the instant of contact at P, the side OP is horizontal.\n- During the ideally short impact, angular momentum about P is conserved (impulse at P has zero moment about P; other external impulses over the short duration are negligible). After impact, the motion is a pure rotation about P with angular speed ω+.\n- The angular momentum about P just before impact is\nH_P− = I_G ω− + m r_GP × v_G−,\nwhere v_G− = ω− k × r_GO (rotation about O) and r_GP, r_GO are vectors from the vertices P, O to the center.

Problem Analysis\n- We have a wedge of mass M and angle θ resting on a smooth horizontal table (no external horizontal force).\n- A small block of mass m slides without friction on the incline and is attached to the top of the wedge by a spring (constant k, natural length L0).\n- The block is released from rest at a distance s = L0 from the top, so the spring is initially unextended.\n- We are asked to find the oscillation period of the small block m as it slides along the incline while the wedge can recoil horizontally.\n\nKey physical features:\n- No friction anywhere.\n- The wedge can move freely horizontally; thus the horizontal momentum of the system is conserved.\n- The spring and gravity provide forces along the incline; the wedge’s motion couples to the block’s motion.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use Lagrangian mechanics with generalized coordinates:\n  - s: the displacement of the block along the incline measured from the top.\n  - X: the horizontal position of the wedge.\n- Identify that X is a cyclic coordinate (no explicit dependence in the Lagrangian), so the corresponding momentum is conserved. Initial rest implies that conserved momentum is zero, allowing elimination of Ẋ in favor of ṡ.\n- This yields an effective one-degree-of-freedom motion in s with an effective inertial mass m_eff.\n- The potential energy is quadratic in s with a linear gravitational term; equilibrium is shifted by gravity, but the motion is harmonic with frequency determined by k and m_eff.\n\n3.

The refracted angle in the film is i1 (Snell’s law).\n- The incidence is such that the interfaces n2 → n1 are beyond the critical angle (total internal reflection, TIR). Thus, inside the film, the normal component of the wavevector is imaginary (evanescent field).\n- We are asked to find the total reflectance Rs (intensity reflectance for s-polarization) accounting for multiple reflections/refractions (a Fabry–Pérot slab with evanescent tunneling).\n\nSection 2. Approach\n- Use the standard thin-film (Fabry–Pérot) amplitude reflection formula for a slab with symmetric surroundings (n2–n1–n2).\n- For s-polarization, write the single-interface Fresnel coefficient r01,s (from n2 to n1) and r12,s (from n1 to n2). In the symmetric case r12,s = −r01,s.\n- The slab round-trip phase is δ = k1z d, where k1z is the z-component of the wavevector in the film. In the TIR regime, cos i1 is imaginary and δ is purely imaginary; this produces an exponential factor e−2κd describing evanescent tunneling (“frustrated TIR”).\n- Insert these into the Airy formula, simplify, and take the squared magnitude to obtain Rs.\n\nSection 3. Solution Steps\n\n3.1. Geometry, Snell’s law, and evanescence\n- Snell’s law: n2 sin i2 = n1 sin i1 ⇒ sin i1 = (n2/n1) sin i2 = (1/n) sin i2.\n- TIR at the n2→n1 interface occurs for sin i2 > n (since n < 1). In this regime,\n  cos i1 = i sqrt(sin^2 i1 − 1) = i sqrt((sin^2 i2)/n^2 − 1) = i (1/n) sqrt(sin^2 i2 − n^2).\n\n3.2. Single-interface Fresnel coefficient (s-polarization)\n- For s-polarization (E ⟂ plane of incidence), the amplitude reflection coefficient from n2 to n1 is\n  r01,s = (n2 cos i2 − n1 cos i1)/(n2 cos i2 + n1 cos i1)\n         = (cos i2 − n cos i1)/(cos i2 + n cos i1).\n- Using cos i1 = i (1/n) sqrt(sin^2 i2 − n^2), we get\n  n cos i1 = i sqrt(sin^2 i2 − n^2) ≡ i α, with α = sqrt(sin^2 i2 − n^2).\n  Hence\n  r01,s = (cos i2 − i α)/(cos i2 + i α).\n- Note: |r01,s| = 1 (as expected for TIR at a single interface); r01,s is a pure phase, r01,s = e−2 i φ with φ = arctan(α/cos i2).\n\n3.3. Slab phase thickness in the TIR regime\n- The z-component of the wavevector in the film: k1z = (2π/λ0) n1 cos i1, where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength.\n- Given that λ is the wavelength in n2, λ0 = n2 λ.

Thin-film (Airy) amplitude reflection coefficient\n- For a symmetric slab (n2–n1–n2), the amplitude reflection coefficient is\n  r_slab,s = (r01,s + r12,s e2 i δ)/(1 + r01,s r12,s e2 i δ).\n- Symmetry gives r12,s = −r01,s, so\n  r_slab,s = r01,s (1 − e2 i δ)/(1 − r01,s^2 e2 i δ).\n- With δ = i κ d, this becomes\n  r_slab,s = r01,s (1 − e−2 κ d)/(1 − r01,s^2 e−2 κ d).\n\n3.5. Total reflectance Rs\n- The intensity reflectance is Rs = |r_slab,s|^2. Using |r01,s| = 1, a convenient form is obtained by writing r01,s = e−2 i φ, so r01,s^2 = e−4 i φ and defining x ≡ e−2 κ d:\n  Rs = | r01,s |^2 |1 − x|^2 / |1 − r01,s^2 x|^2\n     = (1 − x)^2 / |1 − e−4 i φ x|^2\n     = (1 − x)^2 / (1 − 2 x cos 4 φ + x^2).\n- Here\n  φ = arctan( sqrt(sin^2 i2 − n^2)/cos i2 ),     x = exp(−2 κ d),     κ = (2π/λ) sqrt(sin^2 i2 − n^2).\n- Equivalently, one may use the explicit interface coefficient:\n  r01,s = (cos i2 − i sqrt(sin^2 i2 − n^2))/(cos i2 + i sqrt(sin^2 i2 − n^2)),\n  and\n  Rs = | r01,s (1 − e−2 κ d)/(1 − r01,s^2 e−2 κ d) |^2,\n  with κ as above.\n\n3.6.

For steady, fully developed, incompressible flow, the velocity is v = (0, 0, u(x,y)), and pressure p = p(z) with dp/dz = constant.\n- The axial component of the steady Navier–Stokes equation reduces to\n  0 = −(1/ρ) dp/dz + (μ/ρ) ∇⊥^2 u,\n  or equivalently\n  μ ∇⊥^2 u = dp/dz.\n- Define G = −dp/dz = Δp/l > 0 (positive driving gradient). Then\n  ∇⊥^2 u = −G/μ,\n  with boundary condition u = 0 on the three sides (no-slip).\n\nStep 2: Ansatz using distances to the sides of the equilateral triangle\n- Let r1, r2, r3 be the perpendicular distances from a point (x,y) to the three sides. Inside an equilateral triangle of altitude h = (√3/2) a:\n  - Each ri is a linear function of x,y; hence ∇ri is a constant unit normal vector ni pointing inward and ∇^2 ri = 0.\n  - The pairwise dot products of inward unit normals satisfy ni · nj = cos 120° = −1/2 for i ≠ j.\n  - The sum of perpendicular distances to the three sides is constant throughout the triangle:\n    r1 + r2 + r3 = h.\n- Consider u(x,y) = C r1 r2 r3.

Then\n  TQQ = ε [ α^2 n n − (1/2) α^2 I ] ⇒ TQQ · n = ε α^2 [ (n n) · n − (1/2) n ] = ε α^2 (1/2) n.\n  Integrating gives ∮ TQQ · n dA = (ε α^2 / 2) ∮ n dA = 0, since ∮ n dA = 0.\n\n- Contribution from T0Q (the cross term):\n  Using E_Q = α n, we have\n    T0Q · n = ε [ E0 (E_Q · n) + E_Q (E0 · n) − (E0 · E_Q) n ].\n  But E_Q · n = α and E0 · E_Q = α (E0 · n), so\n    T0Q · n = ε [ α E0 + α n (E0 · n) − α (E0 · n) n ] = ε α E0.\n  Remarkably, the angular-dependent terms cancel, leaving a constant vector over S.\n\nTherefore, the net force is\n  F = ∮ T0Q · n dA = ∮ ε α E0 dA = ε α E0 (4π R^2)\n    = ε [ Q / (4π ε R^2) ] E0 (4π R^2) = Q E0.\n\nStep 4: Role of higher multipoles\n- Any higher multipole field behaves as E_m ∼ 1/R^3 (dipole) or faster at large R. Its cross term with E0 contributes to the traction as ∼ ε E0 E_m, whose surface integral scales like R^2 × (1/R^3) → 0 as R → ∞. Thus, only the monopole (net charge) term survives, confirming the result above.\n\nStep 5: Interpretation and independence of εr\n- The result F = Q E0 is independent of εr and R. Physically, in a uniform medium a uniform field exerts a net force Q E0 on a body carrying free charge Q. Polarization charges rearrange how stresses are distributed locally but do not alter the total force when the medium is homogeneous and the body plus its bound-charge layer are treated as one.\n\nDirection and magnitude:\n- The force vector is parallel to E0 if Q > 0 and antiparallel if Q < 0.\n- Magnitude: F = |Q| |E0|.\n\n4) Final Answer\n- Vector form: F_vec = Q E0.\n- Magnitude: F = |Q| E0, where E0 = |E0| is the magnitude of the applied uniform field.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{F = |Q|\\,E_0} \\]"}

We can choose the $\\pmb{x}$ axis along the direction of $\\pmb{E}$, so $\\pmb{E}_{y}=0$, and the velocity components related to transverse components can be treated separately. The equation of motion is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d v}{d t}}=q({\\pmb{E}}+v\\times{\\pmb{B}})\n$$  \n\nIts $\\pmb{z}$ component is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{z}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{z}\n$$  \n\nIntegrating yields  \n\n$$\nv_{\\tau}=\\frac{q E_{z}}{m}t+v_{z0}\n$$  \n\nThis is a simple motion along the direction of $\\pmb{B}$.

Thus, the two equations can be replaced by  \n\n$$\nv_{x}=v_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{\\mathrm{e}}t+\\delta)}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\upsilon_{y}=-i\\upsilon_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the angle between the component of the particle's initial velocity in the $_{xy}$ plane ${\\pmb v}_{\\bot}$ and the $\\pmb{x}$ axis (counter-clockwise direction).

Since we already know that the term $\\textstyle m{\\frac{d v}{d t}}$ only gives rise to circular motion with frequency $\\omega_{c}$, this term can be ignored in equation (1). Thus, equation (1) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{{ E}}+\\pmb{{\\upsilon}}\\times\\pmb{{ B}}=0\n$$  \n\nBy taking the cross product of $\\pmb{B}$ with the above expression, we get  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{E}\\times\\pmb{B}=\\pmb{B}\\times(\\pmb{v}\\times\\pmb{B})=\\pmb{v}\\pmb{B}^{2}-\\pmb{B}(\\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{B})\n$$  \n\nThe transverse component of this equation is  \n\n$$\nv_{\\perp q c}=E\\times B/B^{2}\\equiv v_{E}\n$$  \n\nWe define this transverse component as $\\pmb{v}_{E}$, which is the electric field drift towards the center of guidance.\n\nThe equation of motion for the particle is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d{\\boldsymbol{v}}}{d t}}=q[{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{y}})+{\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times{\\boldsymbol{B}}]\n$$  \n\nDecomposing into scalar form, we have  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{x}=\\frac{q B}{m}v_{y}+\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}(y)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{y}=-\\frac{q B}{m}v_{x}\n$$  \n\nSimplifying yields  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{\\upsilon}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\upsilon_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\frac{\\dot{E}_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\pmb{E_{x}}(\\pmb{y})$ is the electric field at the particle's location. To compute this value, we need to know the particle's trajectory, which is precisely what we attempt to solve initially. If the electric field is weak, as a first approximation, we can estimate $E_{x}(y)$ using the undisturbed trajectory.\n\nThe trajectory in the absence of an electric field is given by  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{r_{L}=\\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{|q|B}}\\end{array}$ is the Larmor gyration radius, and we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)\n$$  \n\nWe seek a solution that is the sum of the gyration at $\\omega_{c}$ and a stationary drift $_{v_{E}}$. Since we are interested in expressing $v_{E}$, we can average over one cycle to eliminate the gyration motion. Thus, the equation yields  \n\n$$\n\\bar{v}_{x}=0\n$$  \n\nIn the above equation, the average of the oscillating term $\\ddot{v}_{y}$ is clearly zero, giving us  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\ddot{v}}}_{y}=0=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\overline{{v}}_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\overline{{\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)}}\n$$  \n\nUpon expanding the small approximation and averaging, we find  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{v}}_{y}=-\\frac{E_{x}(y_{0})}{B}(1-\\frac{1}{4}k^{2}r_{L}^{2})\n$$  \n\nThus, due to non-uniformity, the usual $\\pmb{{E}}\\times\\pmb{{B}}$ drift is modified to  \n\n$$\n\\boxed{v_{E}={\\frac{E\\times B}{B^{2}}}(1-{\\frac{1}{4}}{(k \\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{\\vert{q}\\vert B})}^2)}\n$$  \n\nThe correction term represents the finite Larmor radius effect under the sinusoidal electric field distribution.", "final_answers": "$$\nv_E = \\frac{E \\times B}{B^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left(k \\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q| B}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$", "improved_solutions": "1) Problem Analysis\n- We have a charged particle (charge q, mass m) in a uniform magnetic field B = B ẑ and a nonuniform, static electric field E(y) = E0 cos(k y) x̂.\n- In a uniform B, the particle executes Larmor gyration with cyclotron frequency Ωc and Larmor radius ρ about a guiding center. The perpendicular guiding-center drift due to E is the E×B drift.\n- Because E is nonuniform across the Larmor orbit, the drift must be computed from the gyro-averaged electric field. The problem asks for the guiding-center drift velocity to the lowest order that differs from the uniform-E case, assuming E is weak and using the initial position (x0, y0, z0).\n\n2) Approach\n- Use the unperturbed circular gyromotion in the uniform magnetic field to represent the instantaneous particle position:\n  r(t) ≈ Rgc + ρ[cos(Ωt + δ) x̂ + sin(Ωt + δ) ŷ]\n  where Rgc is the guiding-center position (approximately constant over one gyroperiod when E is weak), Ω = qB/m is the cyclotron frequency (we will use Ωc = |q|B/m for magnitudes), and ρ = v⊥/Ωc is the Larmor radius.\n- Evaluate the instantaneous E×B drift using the local electric field E(y(t)), then average over one gyroperiod. Equivalently, first gyro-average E over the orbit ⟨E⟩ and then take ⟨vE⟩ = ⟨E⟩ × B / B^2.\n- Use the Bessel-function identity to perform the gyro-average: (1/2π)∫0^{2π} cos(a + b sinφ) dφ = cos(a) J0(b).\n- Expand the result for small kρ to extract the lowest-order correction relative to the uniform-E case.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep 1: Unperturbed gyromotion and kinematics\n- In a uniform magnetic field B = B ẑ, the unperturbed perpendicular motion is circular:\n  x(t) = Xgc + ρ cos(Ωt + δ)\n  y(t) = Ygc + ρ sin(Ωt + δ)\n  where Ω = qB/m, ρ = v⊥/Ωc with Ωc = |q|B/m, and δ is the initial gyrophase. For the weak electric field, the guiding center Rgc ≈ (Xgc, Ygc, Zgc) is nearly constant over one gyroperiod. To leading order over one period, take Ygc ≈ y0.\n\nStep 2: Instantaneous E×B drift and gyro-average\n- The instantaneous E-field is\n  E(t) = E0 cos(k y(t)) x̂ = E0 cos[k(Ygc + ρ sin(Ωt + δ))] x̂.\n- The instantaneous E×B drift velocity is\n  vE(t) = E(t) × B / B^2 = [E0 cos(k y(t)) x̂] × (B ẑ) / B^2.\n  Using x̂ × ẑ = − ŷ, we get\n  vE(t) = − [E0/B] cos(k y(t)) ŷ.\n- The guiding-center drift is the gyro-average over one cyclotron period T = 2π/|Ω|:\n  ⟨vE⟩ = − (E0/B) ⟨cos(k y(t))⟩ ŷ.\n\nStep 3: Gyro-average of cos(k y(t))\n- Write φ = Ωt + δ as the gyro-angle. Then\n  y(t) = Ygc + ρ sinφ\n  so\n  ⟨cos(k y(t))⟩ = (1/2π) ∫0^{2π} cos[k(Ygc + ρ sinφ)] dφ.\n- Use the identity for Bessel functions:\n  (1/2π) ∫0^{2π} cos(A + B sinφ) dφ = cos(A) J0(B).\n  With A = k Ygc and B = k ρ, we obtain\n  ⟨cos(k y(t))⟩ = cos(k Ygc) J0(k ρ).\n\nThus the gyro-averaged drift is\n⟨vE⟩ = − [E0/B] J0(k ρ) cos(k Ygc) ŷ.\n\nStep 4: Lowest-order correction relative to the uniform-E case\n- For small kρ (finite Larmor radius small compared to the electric-field variation scale), expand the Bessel function:\n  J0(kρ) ≈ 1 − (kρ)^2/4 + O((kρ)^4).\n- Because the electric field is weak, Ygc is nearly constant over a gyroperiod, and to leading order we set Ygc ≈ y0 (the initial y position).\n- Therefore, to the lowest order that differs from the uniform case,\n  ⟨vE⟩ ≈ − (E0/B) [1 − (kρ)^2/4] cos(k y0) ŷ,\n  with ρ = v⊥/Ωc = m v⊥/(|q| B).\n- Note: The along-field motion v∥ ẑ remains v∥ = vz to this order, and the drift above is the perpendicular guiding-center drift.\n\n4) Physical interpretation\n- In a uniform E and B, the E×B drift is −(E0/B) ŷ (taking E0 along +x and B along +z). Here, because E varies in y, the guiding-center samples different E over its orbit. Gyroaveraging introduces a reduction factor J0(kρ) (finite Larmor radius effect), and the local value of the drift is set by cos(k Ygc).\n- The first nontrivial correction is O((kρ)^2), showing that nonuniformity reduces the magnitude of the drift relative to the uniform-E case.\n\n### Final Answer\nGeneral gyro-averaged drift:\n[ \\boxed{ \\langle \\mathbf{v}_{gc,\\perp} \\rangle = -\\,\\frac{E_0}{B}\\,J_0(k\\rho)\\,\\cos(k\\,Y_{gc})\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\quad \\rho=\\frac{v_\\perp}{\\Omega_c}=\\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q|B} } ]\n\nLowest-order correction (weak E, evaluate at initial y0 and expand J0):\n[ \\boxed{ \\langle \\mathbf{v}_{gc,\\perp} \\rangle \\simeq -\\,\\frac{E_0}{B}\\left[1-\\frac{(k\\rho)^2}{4}\\right]\\cos(k y_0)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} } ]"}

In the reduced even-lattice, that is between sites m = 0 and m = 2 (a separation of d = 2 in the reduced lattice’s unit step).\n\n3.2 Two-point resistance via the spectral (Fourier) integral\n- For a 1D infinite, translation-invariant network with conductances:\n  • g1 to nearest neighbors (±1 step in the reduced indexing m)\n  • g2 to next-nearest neighbors (±2 steps),\n  the two-point resistance between sites separated by d steps is\n  R(d) = (1/π) ∫_0^π [1 − cos(dk)] / [2g1(1 − cos k) + 2g2(1 − cos 2k)] dk.\n\n- Here, d = 2, g1 = 2/(3R), g2 = 1/(3R). Thus\n  R04 = (1/π) ∫_0^π (1 − cos 2k) / [2(2/(3R))(1 − cos k) + 2(1/(3R))(1 − cos 2k)] dk.\n\n- Simplify the integrand using trigonometric identities:\n  1 − cos k = 2 sin^2(k/2),\n  1 − cos 2k = 2 sin^2 k = 8 sin^2(k/2) cos^2(k/2).\n\n  Denominator:\n  2g1(1 − cos k) + 2g2(1 − cos 2k)\n  = (4/(3R))·2 sin^2(k/2) + (2/(3R))·8 sin^2(k/2) cos^2(k/2)\n  = (2/(3R)) [2(1 − cos k) + (1 − cos 2k)].\n\n  Therefore\n  R04 = (3R/2π) ∫_0^π (1 − cos 2k)/[2(1 − cos k) + (1 − cos 2k)] dk.\n\n- Using the identities above,\n  (1 − cos 2k) = 8 sin^2(k/2) cos^2(k/2),\n  2(1 − cos k) + (1 − cos 2k)\n  = 4 sin^2(k/2) + 8 sin^2(k/2) cos^2(k/2)\n  = 4 sin^2(k/2)[1 + 2 cos^2(k/2)].\n\n  Thus the fraction becomes\n  (1 − cos 2k) / [2(1 − cos k) + (1 − cos 2k)]\n  = [8 sin^2(k/2) cos^2(k/2)] / [4 sin^2(k/2)(1 + 2 cos^2(k/2))]\n  = 2 cos^2(k/2) / [1 + 2 cos^2(k/2)].\n\n  Hence\n  R04 = (3R/2π) ∫_0^π 2 cos^2(k/2) / [1 + 2 cos^2(k/2)] dk\n       = (3R/π) ∫_0^π [cos^2(k/2)] / [1 + 2 cos^2(k/2)] dk.\n\n- Evaluate the integral via the tangent half-angle substitution t = tan(k/2):\n  sin^2(k/2) = t^2/(1 + t^2), cos^2(k/2) = 1/(1 + t^2), dk = 2 dt/(1 + t^2),\n  and as k goes 0 → π, t goes 0 → ∞.\n\n  The integrand transforms to\n  cos^2(k/2) / [1 + 2 cos^2(k/2)] = [1/(1 + t^2)] / [1 + 2/(1 + t^2)]\n  = [1/(1 + t^2)] / [(3 + t^2)/(1 + t^2)] = 1/(t^2 + 3).\n\n  Including dk,\n  R04 = (3R/π) ∫_0^∞ [1/(t^2 + 3)] · [2 dt/(1 + t^2)]\n      = (3R/π) ∫_0^∞ 2 dt / [(t^2 + 1)(t^2 + 3)].\n\n- Partial fractions:\n  2/[(t^2 + 1)(t^2 + 3)] = 1/(t^2 + 1) − 1/(t^2 + 3).\n\n  Therefore\n  R04 = (3R/π) [∫_0^∞ dt/(t^2 + 1) − ∫_0^∞ dt/(t^2 + 3)]\n      = (3R/π) [π/2 − π/(2√3)]\n      = (3R/2) (1 − 1/√3)\n      = R (3 − √3)/2.\n\nThus, the equivalent thermal resistance between nodes 0 and 4 is R(3 − √3)/2.\n\n3.3 Cross-check by discrete recurrence (difference equation)\n- In the even-node lattice (index m = n/2), let conductances be g1 = 2/(3R) to m ± 1 and g2 = 1/(3R) to m ± 2.\n- For all m ≠ 0, 2 (no sources), Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) gives:\n  (2g1 + 2g2) V_m − g1(V_{m−1} + V_{m+1}) − g2(V_{m−2} + V_{m+2}) = 0.\n\n- Seek homogeneous solutions V_m ∝ z^m, which yields the characteristic equation\n  g2(z^2 + z^−2 − 2) + g1(z + z^−1 − 2) = 0,\n  or, equivalently (after clearing by z^2 and substituting g1/g2 = 2),\n  z^4 + 2 z^3 − 6 z^2 + 2 z + 1 = 0.\n\n- This palindromic quartic reduces via y = z + z^−1 to y^2 + 2y − 8 = 0, giving y = 2 or y = −4.

A collinear beam of photons (propagating in the same +x direction as the mirror) impinges on the mirror for some time with constant power, delivering a total energy E in the lab frame. The mirror is otherwise free (no external forces). After the interaction, the mirror’s velocity is v1 = β1 c. We are asked to find an expression for β1 in terms of β0, m, c, and E.\n\nKey physical points:\n- The interaction is one-dimensional and perfectly elastic (reflection off an ideal mirror).\n- The total 4-momentum (mirror + radiation) is conserved.\n- Only the total energy E of the incident radiation matters, not the details of the power profile over time.\n\n### Approach\nWe use conservation of 4-momentum expressed in light-cone components. Light-cone variables simplify the algebra for collinear, massless (photon) momenta:\n- For any 4-momentum (E/c, p), define the “plus” and “minus” components: p^+ = E/c + p and p^- = E/c − p.\n- For a photon moving in +x, k^+ = 2ε/c and k^- = 0; for a photon moving in −x, k^+ = 0 and k^- = 2ε/c.\n- For a massive particle (the mirror), define u^+ = γ(1 + β), u^- = γ(1 − β), so that p_m^+ = m c u^+, p_m^- = m c u^- and u^+ u^- = 1.\n\nBecause the reflected radiation travels in the −x direction, its total “plus” component is zero. Hence conservation of the “plus” light-cone component immediately yields a simple relation for u1^+ = γ1(1 + β1), from which β1 can be recovered.\n\n### Solution Steps\n1) Kinematics and light-cone variables\n- Mirror initial 4-momentum:\n  p0 = (γ0 m c, γ0 m β0 c) ⇒ p0^+ = γ0 m c (1 + β0) = m c u0^+, with u0^+ ≡ γ0(1 + β0).\n- Total incident radiation 4-momentum (all photons along +x, total lab energy E):\n  K_in^+ = 2E/c, K_in^- = 0.\n- Total reflected radiation 4-momentum (all photons along −x, total lab energy E′ in general):\n  K_out^+ = 0, K_out^- = 2E′/c.\n- Mirror final 4-momentum:\n  p1 = (γ1 m c, γ1 m β1 c) ⇒ p1^+ = m c u1^+, with u1^+ ≡ γ1(1 + β1).\n\n2) Conservation of 4-momentum in light-cone form\n- Plus component:\n  p0^+ + K_in^+ = p1^+ + K_out^+ ⇒ m c u0^+ + 2E/c = m c u1^+ + 0.\n  Therefore,\n  u1^+ = u0^+ + 2E/(m c^2).    (1)\n- Note: We do not need the minus component (which would determine E′) to find β1.\n\n3) Recover β1 from u1^+\n- The light-cone variable u^+ relates to β via:\n  u^+ = γ(1 + β) = (1 + β)/sqrt(1 − β^2) = sqrt((1 + β)/(1 − β)).\n  Hence,\n  u^{+2} = (1 + β)/(1 − β) ⇒ β = (u^{+2} − 1)/(u^{+2} + 1).    (2)\n- Apply (2) to u1^+ from (1):\n  Define A ≡ u1^+ = u0^+ + 2E/(m c^2).\n  Then,\n  β1 = (A^2 − 1)/(A^2 + 1).    (3)\n\n4) Express u0^+ in terms of β0 (or γ0)\n- Either u0^+ = γ0(1 + β0), with γ0 = 1/sqrt(1 − β0^2), or\n  u0^+ = sqrt((1 + β0)/(1 − β0)).\n- Thus a fully explicit form is\n  A = γ0(1 + β0) + 2E/(m c^2)\n  and β1 = (A^2 − 1)/(A^2 + 1).\n\nRemarks:\n- The result depends only on the total incident energy E and initial state (m, β0); it is independent of how the power varies in time during the interaction.\n- As E → 0, u1^+ → u0^+ and β1 → β0, as expected.\n- As E increases, u1^+ increases and β1 → 1.\n\n### Final Answer\nLet u0^+ = γ0(1 + β0) = sqrt((1 + β0)/(1 − β0)) and define\nA = u0^+ + 2E/(m c^2).\nThen the final velocity is\n[ \\boxed{ \\beta_1 = \\frac{A^2 - 1}{A^2 + 1} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad A = \\gamma_0(1+\\beta_0) + \\frac{2E}{m c^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta_0}{1-\\beta_0}} + \\frac{2E}{m c^2} } ]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We have a homogeneous rectangular picture frame (length 2c, width 2d, mass m) suspended by a light, inextensible string of total length 2a. The string passes over a frictionless nail and is attached to the two vertices of one of the long sides of the frame.\n- The frame is in static equilibrium under three forces: the two string tensions acting at the two attached corners, and the weight mg acting at the center of mass (CM).\n- We must find the equilibrium angle α between the long side of the frame and the horizontal, with α ∈ (0, π/2]. The given inequality c^4 > a^2 d^2 − c^2 d^2 ensures consistency of the solution (in particular, that the expression for cos α stays in (0, 1]).\n\nKey physical facts:\n- The nail is frictionless, and the string is light and inextensible, so the tension is the same in both segments.\n- A rigid body in equilibrium under three non-parallel forces has lines of action that are concurrent (meet at a single point).\n\n2. Approach\n- Use three-force concurrency: since both tensions pass through the nail, the weight’s line of action must also pass through the nail. Hence the CM lies directly below the nail.\n- Set up a coordinate system with the nail at the origin. Resolve the geometry of the two attached corners relative to the CM using the frame’s orientation α.\n- Use:\n  (i) horizontal force balance (resultant of the two tensions is vertical),\n  (ii) the string length constraint (sum of two segment lengths equals 2a),\n  (iii) torque balance about the CM.\n- Introduce direction cosines of the string segments: h for the horizontal (magnitude) component and v for the vertical component, with h^2 + v^2 = 1.\n- From (i) and (ii) derive h = (c/a) cos α.\n- From torque balance derive c h = d v.\n- Combine these to solve for α.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1. Geometry and coordinates\n- Place the nail at the origin O = (0, 0).\n- Since the three forces must be concurrent and the two tensions act along lines to the nail, the weight mg must act through the nail. Therefore, the CM lies on the vertical through the nail. Let the CM be at C = (0, −y_c).\n- Let e1 be the unit vector along the long side of the frame: e1 = (cos α, sin α).\n- Let e2 be the unit vector perpendicular to e1 obtained by a +90° rotation: e2 = (− sin α, cos α).\n- The two attachment corners are the ends of one long side. Relative to the CM they are at\n  r± = (± c) e1 + d e2.\n- Their coordinates relative to the origin are then\n  R± = C + r± = (x±, y± − y_c),\n  where\n  x± = ± c cos α − d sin α,\n  y± = ± c sin α + d cos α.\n\nStep 2. Forces and useful direction cosines\n- The string tension T is the same in both legs (frictionless nail, light string).\n- The force directions on the frame at the two corners point from the corner to the nail. Let the distances from the nail to the two corners be\n  r± = sqrt[ x±^2 + (y± − y_c)^2 ].\n- Define the (positive) direction cosines of each string segment as:\n  h = |x±| / r±  (horizontal magnitude fraction),\n  v = |y± − y_c| / r±  (vertical fraction),\n  which satisfy h^2 + v^2 = 1.\n\nStep 3. Horizontal balance and string length constraint\n- Because the resultant of the two equal tensions must balance the weight vertically, the horizontal components cancel:\n  x+/r+ + x−/r− = 0  ⇒  |x+|/r+ = |x−|/r− = h.\n- The string is inextensible of total length 2a:\n  r+ + r− = 2 a.\n- From |x±|/r± = h we have r± = |x±|/h, hence\n  r+ + r− = (|x+| + |x−|)/h = 2 a.\n- In the typical equilibrium regime (consistent with the given inequality), c cos α ≥ d sin α so that x+ ≥ 0 and x− ≤ 0, and thus\n  |x+| + |x−| = (c cos α − d sin α) + (c cos α + d sin α) = 2 c cos α.\n- Therefore\n  2 a = (2 c cos α)/h  ⇒  h = (c/a) cos α.   (1)\n\nStep 4. Torque balance about the CM: c h = d v\n- Take moments about the CM. The torque from weight is zero about the CM (it acts at CM), and the lines of action of the tensions do not pass through the CM in general, so their torques must sum to zero.\n- The force directions at the two corners have components (upward vertical, opposite horizontal): in terms of (h, v) they are proportional to (∓ h, + v).\n- A direct 2D torque calculation about the CM gives the condition\n  c h = d v.   (2)\n  Brief derivation (sketch):\n  - Write r± = (x±, y±) and unit force directions t± = (− sgn(x±) h, v).\n  - The scalar torque about the CM is τ = T [ r+ × t+ + r− × t− ].\n  - Using x+ + x− = −2 d sin α and y+ − y− = 2 c sin α, one obtains\n    τ ∝ 2 sin α (c h − d v) = 0,\n    for α ∈ (0, π/2], which implies c h = d v.\n\nStep 5. Solve for α\n- From (2), write h = (d/c) v. With h^2 + v^2 = 1, we get\n  h^2 = (d^2/c^2) v^2  and  h^2 + v^2 = 1\n  ⇒ (d^2/c^2) v^2 + v^2 = 1\n  ⇒ v^2 (1 + d^2/c^2) = 1\n  ⇒ v^2 = c^2 / (c^2 + d^2),  and  h^2 = d^2 / (c^2 + d^2).\n- Using (1): h = (c/a) cos α. Hence\n  (c^2/a^2) cos^2 α = d^2 / (c^2 + d^2)\n  ⇒ cos^2 α = (a^2 d^2) / (c^2 (c^2 + d^2)).\n- Taking the positive square root (since α ∈ (0, π/2] gives cos α ≥ 0):\n  cos α = (a d) / (c sqrt(c^2 + d^2)).\n- Therefore\n  α = arccos [ (a d) / (c sqrt(c^2 + d^2)) ].\n- The given inequality c^4 > a^2 d^2 − c^2 d^2 is equivalent to (a d)/(c sqrt(c^2 + d^2)) < 1, ensuring a valid α in (0, π/2].\n\n4. Final Answer\n- The equilibrium angle is independent of m and g (they only set the tension magnitude), and is determined purely by geometry and string length.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,\\alpha \\;=\\; \\arccos\\!\\left(\\frac{a\\,d}{\\,c\\,\\sqrt{c^{2}+d^{2}}}\\right)\\,}\n\\]"}

We must find the minimum projectile energy E1 that allows this inelastic process, accounting for recoil and photon emission.\n\nSection 2. Approach\n- Model X2 semiclassically in its CM frame using a relativistic circular-orbit Bohr picture:\n  - Force balance (relativistic centripetal force).\n  - Quantization of total orbital angular momentum.\n  - Compute the total internal energy E_n of X2.\n  - Impose v1 < c to obtain αc.\n- With α = αc/2, compute:\n  - The orbital speeds v1, v2, Lorentz factors γ1, γ2.\n  - The internal energies E_g = E1 (ground) and E_e = E2 (first excited).\n  - The excitation gap Δ = E_e − E_g.\n- For the lab scattering:\n  - Treat the projectile as massless (ultra-relativistic) and X2 initially at rest (mass m_g = E_g/c^2).\n  - Let the final state be the excited X2 (mass m_e = E_e/c^2) plus one emitted photon. Use 4‑momentum conservation and on-shell conditions to find the photon energy as a function of E and emission angle θ.\n  - The process becomes kinematically allowed when a real (non-negative energy) photon solution exists. Minimizing the required E gives the threshold.\n\nSection 3. Solution Steps\n\n3.1 Relativistic Bohr model for two equal masses\n- In the CM frame, the two equal masses (M) move on a circular orbit of separation R, each at distance R/2 from the CM with speed v. The force is central with magnitude F(R) = α/R^2 (attractive), corresponding to V(R) = −α/R.\n\nRelativistic circular motion (transverse dynamics) requires\nγ M v^2\n———————— = F(R) = α/R^2\n R/2\n\n⇒ 2 γ M v^2 / R = α/R^2\n⇒ α/R = 2 γ M v^2.  (1)\n\n- Bohr quantization of the total orbital angular momentum Ltotal gives\nLtotal = 2 × (γ M v)(R/2) = γ M v R = n ħ,  n = 1, 2, …\n⇒ R = n ħ / (γ M v).  (2)\n\n- Combine (1) and (2) to eliminate R:\nα/R = α (γ M v)/(n ħ) = 2 γ M v^2\n⇒ α/(n ħ) = 2 v\n⇒ v_n = α/(2 n ħ).  (3)\n\n- The total internal energy for the pair is\nE(R) = 2 γ M c^2 + V(R) = 2 γ M c^2 − α/R.\nUsing (1): α/R = 2 γ M v^2, so\nE_n = 2 γ M c^2 − 2 γ M v^2 = 2 γ M (c^2 − v^2) = 2 M c^2 (1 − β^2) γ\n= 2 M c^2 / γ,  where β = v/c and γ = 1/√(1 − β^2).  (4)\n\n- From (3), β_n = v_n/c = α/(2 n ħ c). Therefore\nγ_n = 1 / √(1 − (α/(2 n ħ c))^2).  (5)\n\n3.2 Maximum coupling αc (existence of ground state)\n- For a physical (subluminal) ground-state orbit (n = 1), we require v1 < c:\nv1/c = α/(2 ħ c) < 1 ⇒ α < 2 ħ c.\nThus the maximum coupling allowing a stable ground state is\nα_c = 2 ħ c.  (6)\n\n3.3 Set α = αc/2 and compute E_g, E_e, and Δ\n- With α = αc/2 = ħ c, from (3) we get\nv_n = α/(2 n ħ) = (ħ c)/(2 n ħ) = c/(2 n).\nHence\nβ_1 = 1/2,  β_2 = 1/4,\nγ_1 = 1/√(1 − 1/4) = 2/√3,  γ_2 = 1/√(1 − 1/16) = 4/√15.\n\n- From (4),\nE_g = E_1 = 2 M c^2 / γ_1 = √3 M c^2,\nE_e = E_2 = 2 M c^2 / γ_2 = (√15/2) M c^2.\n\n- Excitation gap:\nΔ = E_e − E_g = (√15/2 − √3) M c^2.  (7)\n\nNumerically, Δ ≈ (1.9365 − 1.7321) M c^2 ≈ 0.2044 M c^2.\n\n3.4 Lab-frame inelastic process and threshold\n- Initial state (lab frame L): X2 at rest with rest energy E_g, and a massless projectile with energy E propagating along z.\n- Final state: excited X2 (rest energy E_e) recoiling, plus one emitted photon of energy E_s at polar angle θ.\n\nFour-momentum conservation:\nP_g + k = P_e + k_s,\nwhere\nP_g = (E_g/c, 0),  k = (E/c, 0, 0, E/c),\nk_s = (E_s/c, (E_s/c) sinθ, 0, (E_s/c) cosθ).\n\nPut P_e = P_g + k − k_s and impose the on-shell condition P_e^2 = m_e^2 c^2 with m_e c^2 = E_e. Using the metric (+, −, −, −) and k^2 = k_s^2 = 0:\n\n(P_g + k − k_s)^2 = P_g^2 + 2 P_g·k − 2 P_g·k_s − 2 k·k_s\n= m_g^2 c^2 + 2 (E_g E)/c^2 − 2 (E_g E_s)/c^2 − 2 (E E_s/c^2)(1 − cosθ)\n= m_e^2 c^2,\n\nwith m_g c^2 = E_g. Multiply by c^2 and rearrange to solve for E_s:\n\n2 E_s [E_g + E (1 − cosθ)] = m_g^2 c^4 + 2 E E_g − m_e^2 c^4.\n\nUsing E_e = E_g + Δ, we have m_e^2 c^4 − m_g^2 c^4 = (E_e^2 − E_g^2) = 2 E_g Δ + Δ^2, so\n\nE_s(θ) = [E_g (E − Δ) − Δ^2/2] / [E_g + E (1 − cosθ)].  (8)\n\nKinematic allowance requires E_s ≥ 0 for some angle θ. For fixed E, E_s is maximized by minimizing the denominator, which occurs at forward emission θ = 0:\nE_s,max = [E_g (E − Δ) − Δ^2/2] / E_g.\n\nThe minimal projectile energy Emin is reached when E_s just vanishes in the forward limit (soft-photon threshold):\nE_s,max → 0+ ⇒ E_g (Emin − Δ) − Δ^2/2 = 0\n⇒ Emin = Δ + Δ^2/(2 E_g).  (9)\n\nNow substitute (7) and E_g = √3 M c^2:\nΔ = (√15/2 − √3) M c^2,  E_g = √3 M c^2.\n\nCompute:\nE1 ≡ Emin = Mc^2 [ (√15/2 − √3) + ( (√15/2 − √3)^2 ) / (2 √3) ].\n\nA short algebraic simplification yields\nE1 = (√3/8) M c^2.  (10)\n\nNumerically, E1 ≈ 0.2165 M c^2, which equals Δ + Δ^2/(2 E_g) with Δ ≈ 0.2044 M c^2 and E_g ≈ 1.732 M c^2.\n\nSection 4. Final Answer\n- The maximum coupling for a stable ground state is αc = 2 ħ c.\n- With α = αc/2, the minimum projectile energy that can excite X2 (n = 1 → n = 2) with emission of a photon is\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{E_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\, M c^2} \\]"}

This gives an algebraic condition on (x, y, z). Eliminating z using x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2 and projecting to the xy-plane yields the desired curve.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nA. Geometry and kinematics at t = 0\n- Work in coordinates relative to the sphere’s center, so a surface point is r = (x, y, z) with x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2.\n- Angular velocity vector: ω = (ω, 0, 0).\n- Initial velocity (tangential) from rigid rotation:\n  v0 = ω × r = (ω, 0, 0) × (x, y, z) = (0, −ω z, ω y).\n- After release, acceleration is gravitational only:\n  a = (0, 0, −g).\n\nB. Squared distance to the center and the detachment criterion\n- The trajectory relative to the center is r(t) = r + v0 t + (1/2) a t^2.\n- Define ρ^2(t) = |r(t)|^2. Its first and second derivatives at t = 0 are:\n  dρ^2/dt|0 = 2 r ⋅ v0 = 0, because v0 is tangential to the sphere (perpendicular to r).\n  d^2ρ^2/dt^2|0 = 2 (|v0|^2 + r ⋅ a).\n- Compute:\n  |v0|^2 = (−ω z)^2 + (ω y)^2 = ω^2 (y^2 + z^2) = ω^2 (R^2 − x^2).\n  r ⋅ a = (x, y, z) ⋅ (0, 0, −g) = −g z.\n- Therefore,\n  d^2ρ^2/dt^2|0 = 2 [ ω^2 (R^2 − x^2) − g z ].\n- Interpretation:\n  - If d^2ρ^2/dt^2|0 > 0, the droplet initially moves away from the sphere (detaches).\n  - If d^2ρ^2/dt^2|0 < 0, it moves inward (cannot be normally flung off).\n  - The boundary is given by:\n    ω^2 (R^2 − x^2) = g z.  (1)\n\nC. Minimum angular speed ω1\n- The most “difficult” point to detach is the top of the sphere (x, y, z) = (0, 0, R). Apply (1):\n  ω^2 R^2 = g R ⇒ ω1 = √(g/R).\n- Thus, for ω ≤ ω1, even the topmost droplet does not detach. We focus on ω > ω1.\n\nD. Projecting the boundary onto the xy-plane\n- On the boundary, we have both the sphere equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2 and condition (1), z = (ω^2/g)(R^2 − x^2).\n- Eliminate z:\n  y^2 = R^2 − x^2 − z^2\n      = R^2 − x^2 − (ω^4/g^2) (R^2 − x^2)^2.  (2)\n- Equation (2) is the projection (onto the xy-plane) of the boundary curve separating the region where droplets cannot be normally flung off (inside, where g z > ω^2 (R^2 − x^2)) from the region where they detach (outside).\n- Domain: for real y, the right-hand side must be nonnegative:\n  R^2 − x^2 − (ω^4/g^2) (R^2 − x^2)^2 ≥ 0\n  ⇒ 0 ≤ R^2 − x^2 ≤ g^2/ω^4.\n  This bounds x for which the projected boundary exists. For ω > ω1, this interval is nonempty.\n\nRemark (intuition check): The equality ω^2 (R^2 − x^2) = g z can be written as v_t^2/R = g cos θ, where v_t^2 = ω^2 (R^2 − x^2) is the squared tangential speed and cos θ = z/R is the cosine of the angle between the outward radial direction and the vertical. It matches the classical “normal force equals zero” detachment condition for motion on a sphere.\n\n### Final Answer\n- Minimum angular speed:\n  ω1 = √(g/R).\n- Projected boundary curve for ω > ω1 (onto the xy-plane):\n  [ \\boxed{\\,y^{2} = R^{2} - x^{2} - \\frac{\\omega^{4}}{g^{2}}\\,(R^{2} - x^{2})^{2}\\,} ]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We have a laser incident along the +z direction onto a steel ruler whose long axis lies in the horizontal plane (ξ = 0) and makes an angle φ with the z-axis. \n- The graduations (marks) on the ruler are evenly spaced with pitch d along the ruler axis and are oriented perpendicular to the ruler axis (as on a typical ruler).\n- A wall (screen) is located a distance L along the z direction from the point where the beam hits the ruler.\n- We seek the spacing Δy between adjacent primary maxima (diffraction orders) near the central (zeroth-order) maximum on the wall along the horizontal y-direction.\n\n2. Approach\n- Model the ruler graduations as a 1D periodic structure (a grating) with period d along the ruler axis u_r. The structure is invariant along the direction of the lines (perpendicular to u_r).\n- In Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction, the angular spectrum (transverse wavevector) of the diffracted field is the Fourier transform of the aperture/scatterer. A 1D comb of period d produces discrete diffraction orders: transverse wavevectors separated by 2π/d along the periodicity direction u_r and continuous along the orthogonal direction.\n- For normal incidence (wavevector along ẑ), the m-th order satisfies a transverse wavevector component k⊥ along u_r equal to 2π m/d. The projection of this transverse wavevector onto ŷ sets the y-position on the screen.\n- Use the small-angle (paraxial) relation between screen position and transverse wavevector: y = L (k_y/k), with k = 2π/λ.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Geometry and unit vectors\n- Coordinate axes: ẑ points from the ruler to the wall; x̂ is vertical; ŷ is horizontal (to the side).\n- The ruler axis u_r lies in the horizontal plane making angle φ with ẑ, so\n  u_r = cosφ ẑ + sinφ ŷ.\n- The graduations (lines) are perpendicular to u_r, so the structure is invariant along that line direction; periodicity is along u_r with spacing d.\n\nStep 2: Diffracted transverse wavevectors from a 1D grating\n- For a 1D periodic structure of period d along u_r, the far-field (Fraunhofer) amplitudes have discrete components at transverse spatial frequencies\n  k⊥ · u_r = 2π m / d,    m ∈ ℤ,\n  where k⊥ is the component of the diffracted wavevector perpendicular to ẑ.\n- For normal incidence (incoming k along ẑ), these are the primary maxima (grating orders).\n\nEquivalently, in angular form within the plane spanned by ẑ and u_r, the m-th order satisfies the grating relation (for small angles):\n  sinθ_m ≈ θ_m = m λ / d,\nwhere θ_m is the angular deviation from ẑ measured within the z–u_r plane.\n\nStep 3: Projection onto the laboratory y-direction\n- The transverse wavevector of the m-th order points along u_r in the horizontal plane with magnitude |k⊥,m| = k θ_m ≈ k (m λ / d), where k = 2π/λ.\n- The y-component of this transverse wavevector is\n  k_y,m = |k⊥,m| (u_r · ŷ) = k (m λ / d) sinφ.\nEquivalently, using the Fourier approach directly:\n  k_y,m = (2π m / d) (u_r · ŷ) = (2π m / d) sinφ,\nwhich is identical since k = 2π/λ.\n\nStep 4: Map transverse wavevector to screen coordinate\n- In the paraxial regime, the position y on the screen at distance L follows\n  y_m = L (k_y,m / k) = L (λ / 2π) k_y,m.\n- Substituting k_y,m from above:\n  y_m = L (λ / 2π) (2π m / d) sinφ = L (λ m / d) sinφ.\n\nStep 5: Spacing between adjacent primary maxima near the center\n- The spacing Δy between orders m and m+1 is\n  Δy = y_{m+1} − y_m = L (λ / d) sinφ,\nwhich is independent of m (constant near the zeroth order), as expected for small angles.\n\nNotes:\n- If φ = 0 (ruler axis parallel to ẑ), then sinφ = 0 and the orders collapse along y (no lateral separation along y), consistent with the geometry.\n- The result assumes paraxial angles (small θ) and that the wall is perpendicular to ẑ at distance L (Fraunhofer mapping).\n\n4.

The second (adjacent) ray strikes the lower surface at P directly.\n- Ignoring any phase change upon reflection, we must find the phase difference φ between these two beams at P, eliminating S in favor of given quantities.\n\n2) Approach\n\n- In a stratified (y-dependent) refractive index, the ray invariant n(y) sin θ(y) is conserved (Snell’s law in gradient media). With incident angle i from air (n0 = 1), one has n(y) sin θ(y) = s ≡ sin i.\n- Use ray geometry to compute:\n  a) The lateral shift 2S accumulated by the first ray during its up-and-down traverse inside the film.\n  b) The internal optical path length (OPL) accumulated by that ray.\n- The phase difference at P equals k0 times (OPL of the first ray − the phase lag between the two incident rays due to their lateral separation), where k0 = 2π/λ.

This produces a single integral for Δφ that can be evaluated explicitly for a linear index profile.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Ray invariant and basic relations\n\n- In a stratified medium n = n(y), Snell’s law yields n(y) sin θ(y) = s, where s = sin i (since n0 = 1).\n- Hence sin θ(y) = s / n(y) and cos θ(y) = √(1 − s^2 / n(y)^2) = √(n(y)^2 − s^2)/n(y).\n\nTwo useful differentials follow:\n- Lateral slope: dx/dy = tan θ = sin θ / cos θ = [s/n(y)] / √(1 − s^2/n(y)^2) = s / √(n(y)^2 − s^2).\n- Optical path element: ds = dy / cos θ = n(y) dy / √(n(y)^2 − s^2). Thus n ds = [n(y)^2/√(n(y)^2 − s^2)] dy.\n\nStep 2: Lateral shift from Q to P\n\n- The upward leg from y = 0 to y = d produces lateral shift Δx_up = ∫_0^d [s/√(n(y)^2 − s^2)] dy.\n- The downward leg produces the same shift.

For typical optical films with n_a > 1 and i ≤ 90°, this holds.\n\nStep 6: Consistency checks\n\n- Uniform-index limit n_b → n_a = n:\n  Then Δφ → (4π/λ) d √(n^2 − s^2), which is exactly the standard result for a uniform film of index n (round-trip inside) interfering with the directly reflected beam.\n- Normal incidence i = 0 (s = 0):\n  Δφ = (2π d)/(λ (n_b − n_a)) [n_b^2 − n_a^2] = (2π d/λ)(n_b + n_a).\n  If n_b = n_a = n, this reduces to 4π n d/λ as expected.\n\n4) Remarks\n\n- We have ignored any reflection phase shifts at the interfaces, per the problem statement. If they were included, Fresnel phase changes (0 or π depending on incidence side) would add constants to Δφ.\n- The derivation relies only on the stratified-medium invariant and geometric relations for rays; it is therefore broadly applicable.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\varphi \\;=\\; \\Delta\\phi \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\pi d}{\\lambda\\, (n_b - n_a)} \\left[\\, n_b\\sqrt{n_b^{2}-\\sin^{2}i}\\;-\\;n_a\\sqrt{n_a^{2}-\\sin^{2}i}\\;-\\;\\sin^{2}i\\;\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{n_b+\\sqrt{n_b^{2}-\\sin^{2}i}}{\\,n_a+\\sqrt{n_a^{2}-\\sin^{2}i}\\,}\\right) \\right] } \\]"}

We are asked to find the difference between the radial oscillation period Tr and the azimuthal revolution period Tφ, to leading order in (R/r0)^2.\n\n2. Approach\n- Since r0 ≫ R, use the multipole expansion of the electrostatic potential due to the n-ring assembly. Symmetry ensures:\n  - Monopole term: total charge nQ at the origin.\n  - Dipole term: vanishes.\n  - Quadrupole term: axisymmetric about z; its contribution scales as 1/r^3.\n- Compute the quadrupole tensor Qij of the assembly by:\n  1) Computing Qij for a single meridional ring (say, in the x–z plane).\n  2) Rotating it by angles kπ/n about z and summing over k=0,…,n−1.\n- On the equatorial plane, the potential is central and equals V(r) = (1/4πϵ0)[(nQ)/r + (quadrupole)/r^3]. This yields a central potential energy for the test charge of the form U(r) = −k/r + α/r^3.\n- For a nearly Keplerian central potential U(r) = −k/r + α/r^3, compute:\n  - The azimuthal frequency Ω of a circular orbit at r0.\n  - The radial (epicyclic) frequency κ of small radial oscillations about r0.\n  - Then Tφ = 2π/Ω, Tr = 2π/κ, and find Tr − Tφ to leading order in (R/r0)^2.\n\n3.

Problem Analysis\n- Two equal masses A and D (each of mass m) are connected by a light rope passing over two smooth pulleys B and C at the same height. The segment AB acts as a pendulum whose length x ≡ AB can change slowly as the system evolves.\n- Initially, AB = x0 and the pendulum is given a small angular displacement θ0; thereafter A executes small oscillations while A slowly descends so that x changes slowly in time.\n- We are asked: when AB = x (with x varying slowly), what is the oscillation amplitude A(x) of the angular motion θ(t)?\n\nKey assumptions:\n- Small-angle oscillations (|θ| ≪ 1).\n- The change in x is slow compared with the oscillation period (adiabatic regime): over a single oscillation, x can be treated as constant, but it changes slowly from cycle to cycle.\n- The rope and pulleys are ideal (massless and frictionless), so the system is conservative.\n\n2. Approach\n- Treat θ as the fast variable and x as a slowly varying parameter.\n- For small oscillations, the θ-dynamics is that of a harmonic oscillator with instantaneous length x. Its instantaneous frequency is ω(x) = √(g/x).\n- Use the adiabatic invariant of a 1D harmonic oscillator: J = (1/2π)∮ pθ dθ = Eθ/ω, which remains approximately constant when the parameter x varies slowly.\n- Express J in terms of the oscillation amplitude A and x, set it equal to its initial value at x = x0, and solve for A(x).\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Small-oscillation Lagrangian for θ at fixed x\n- Choose generalized coordinates (x, θ), where x is the instantaneous length AB and θ is the angular deviation from vertical.\n- For planar motion, the kinetic and potential energies are\n  T = (1/2) m (ẋ^2 + x^2 θ̇^2),  U ≈ (1/2) m g x θ^2  (small-angle, since vertical is equilibrium).\n- In the adiabatic approximation, x varies slowly over many θ-oscillations, so for the fast θ-dynamics at fixed x we use\n  Lθ(x) = (1/2) m x^2 θ̇^2 − (1/2) m g x θ^2.\n\nThis is a harmonic oscillator in θ with:\n- Effective “mass” M = m x^2,\n- Effective “spring” K = m g x,\n- Instantaneous angular frequency ω(x) = √(K/M) = √(g/x).\n\nStep 2: Energy and amplitude relation for the θ-oscillator\n- The instantaneous energy stored in the θ-oscillation is\n  Eθ = (1/2) M ω^2 A^2 = (1/2) (m x^2) (g/x) A^2 = (1/2) m g x A^2,\n  where A is the oscillation amplitude of θ.\n\nStep 3: Adiabatic invariant for slowly varying x\n- Conjugate momentum to θ: pθ = ∂Lθ/∂θ̇ = m x^2 θ̇.\n- The action integral (adiabatic invariant) for one cycle is\n  J = (1/2π) ∮ pθ dθ.\n- For any harmonic oscillator, J = E/ω. Hence here\n  J = Eθ/ω(x) = [(1/2) m g x A^2] / √(g/x) = (1/2) m A^2 √g x^(3/2).\n\nUnder slow variation of x (no dissipation), J is approximately constant:\n  A^2 x^(3/2) = const.\n\nStep 4: Apply initial condition\n- Initially (x = x0), the amplitude is A(x0) = θ0. Therefore\n  θ0^2 x0^(3/2) = A(x)^2 x^(3/2).\n\nSolve for A(x):\n  A(x) = θ0 (x0/x)^(3/4).\n\n4. Final Answer\n- The oscillation amplitude of the angular motion of A when AB = x is given by a power law determined by adiabatic invariance:\n  A(x) = θ0 (x0/x)^(3/4).\n\nThis shows that as the pendulum length x slowly increases, the angular amplitude decreases as x^(-3/4), consistent with conservation of the action for the slowly modulated harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,A(x)\\;=\\;\\theta_{0}\\,\\left(\\dfrac{x_{0}}{x}\\right)^{3/4}\\,} \\]"}

Kinematics and dynamics at the instant of interest\n- When the major axis is horizontal, the contact point P with the table is the lower end of the minor axis.\n- Let O be the geometric center of the ellipse; let c = OFocus = Ae (distance from center to focus).\n- Coordinates in the body frame at this instant: P at (0, −B), F at (c, 0). Then\nPF^2 = c^2 + B^2 = (A e)^2 + B^2 = A^2 e^2 + (A^2 − A^2 e^2) = A^2\nThus PF = A.\n\n- Rolling without slipping: P is the instantaneous center of rotation (no slip ⇒ velocity of P is zero). The only external forces are gravity Mg at F and the contact forces at P; the latter produce no torque about P. Hence\nτ_P = I_P β\nwhere I_P is the moment of inertia about an axis through P perpendicular to the plate:\nI_P = I_F + M (PF)^2 = I_F + M A^2\nThe torque magnitude from gravity about P equals Mg times the horizontal lever arm from P to the vertical line through F. From the coordinates above, this lever arm is c = A e. Therefore\nτ_P = M g c = M g A e\nHence\nβ = τ_P / I_P = M g A e / [I_F + M A^2]\nSubstitute I_F = (M/2) A^2 (1 − e^2)^{3/2}:\nβ = M g A e / [M A^2 + (M/2) A^2 (1 − e^2)^{3/2}]\n  = g A e / [A^2 (1 + (1/2)(1 − e^2)^{3/2})]\n  = (g e) / [A (1 + (1/2)(1 − e^2)^{3/2})]\n\nDirection: With the chosen focus to the right of the center when the major axis is horizontal, the weight produces a clockwise torque; β has clockwise sense. The formula above gives the magnitude.\n\nF. Checks (limits)\n- e → 0 (circle, CM at center): c → 0, so β → 0, as expected (no gravitational torque).\n- e → 1 (degenerate slender limit): (1 − e^2)^{3/2} → 0, so β → g/A, matching the point-mass-at-distance-A-from-pivot result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\beta \\;=\\; \\frac{g\\,e}{A\\left[\\,1+\\tfrac{1}{2}(1-e^{2})^{3/2}\\,\\right]} \\quad \\text{(clockwise, magnitude shown)} } \\]"}

In Young’s double-slit interference, the superposition of these two nearly equal wavelengths produces a slowly varying “beat” envelope that reduces the fringe contrast. Where the contrast goes to zero (γ = 0), the fringes appear blurred.\n- If we filter so that only the line at λ1 passes, the residual finite linewidth (Doppler broadening from thermal motion) gives the source a finite temporal coherence. For a Gaussian (Doppler) spectrum the fringe visibility decays with path delay and never strictly reaches zero. A practical “blur” threshold is taken when the visibility drops to 1/e of its maximum.\n- Geometry: slit separation d (interpreted as center-to-center separation; slit width neglected), screen distance L, far-field (Fraunhofer) condition. We seek the first position x along the screen where blurring occurs:\n  - Without filter: first zero-contrast position from the two-line beat.\n  - With filter (only λ1, Doppler broadened): first position where visibility falls to 1/e.\n\n## Approach\n1. Two-line case (no filter): Superpose two fringe patterns of wavelengths λ1 and λ2 and extract the visibility (contrast) envelope. The visibility goes as |cos[(ϕ1 − ϕ2)/2]| and vanishes at the first zero of the cosine. Use the far-field path difference δ ≈ d x/L.\n2. Single-line case (with filter): Model the λ1 line’s Doppler-broadened spectrum as Gaussian with FWHM ΔνD. The complex degree of temporal coherence for a Gaussian spectrum has modulus |γ(τ)| = exp[−(π ΔνD τ)²/(4 ln 2)]. Use τ = δ/c ≈ (d x)/(c L) and adopt |γ| = 1/e as the practical blur threshold. Solve for x in terms of T, m, λ1, d, and L.\n\n## Solution Steps\n\n### A. Two close lines (λ1, λ2), no filter\n- Two-slit phase for wavelength λ is ϕ(λ, x) = 2π δ/λ with δ ≈ d x/L in the far field.\n- The intensity from each line (equal strength assumed) is Iλ(x) ∝ 1 + cos ϕ(λ, x).\n- Total intensity from the two lines:\n  I(x) ∝ [1 + cos ϕ1] + [1 + cos ϕ2]\n       = 2 + cos ϕ1 + cos ϕ2\n       = 2 + 2 cos[(ϕ1 − ϕ2)/2] cos[(ϕ1 + ϕ2)/2].\n- The fringe visibility (contrast) relative to the background is\n  γ(x) = |cos[(ϕ1 − ϕ2)/2]|.\n- The first blur (γ = 0) occurs when\n  (ϕ1 − ϕ2)/2 = π/2  ⇒  ϕ1 − ϕ2 = π.\n- Substitute ϕi = 2π δ/λi:\n  2π δ (1/λ1 − 1/λ2) = π  ⇒  δ = 1/[2 |1/λ1 − 1/λ2|]\n                          = (λ1 λ2)/(2 |λ2 − λ1|).\n- Using δ ≈ d x/L gives the first blurred position (no filter):\n  xbeat = (L/d) δ = L λ1 λ2 / [2 d |λ2 − λ1|].\n\nThis is the “fringe packet” half-width set by the doublet beat; beyond ±xbeat the contrast vanishes and fringes blur.\n\n### B. Single line (λ1) with Doppler broadening, with filter\n- Doppler broadening (Maxwellian velocities) produces a Gaussian spectrum centered at ν0 = c/λ1 with FWHM\n  ΔνD = ν0 √(8 kB T ln 2 / (m c²)).\n  Derivation sketch: line-of-sight speed v is Gaussian with σv = √(kB T/m); nonrelativistic Doppler gives Δν/ν0 ≈ v/c, so spectral standard deviation σν = (ν0/c) σv; convert σν to FWHM via ΔνD = 2 √(2 ln 2) σν.\n- For a Gaussian spectrum, the normalized complex degree of temporal coherence has modulus\n  |γ(τ)| = exp[−(π ΔνD τ)²/(4 ln 2)].\n- In two-slit interference with equal intensities, the fringe visibility equals |γ(τ)|, with time delay τ given by the optical path difference δ divided by c:\n  τ = δ/c ≈ (d x)/(c L).\n- A true zero of |γ| does not occur for a Gaussian, so adopt the practical blurring criterion (as stated): the fringes are too dim when the visibility falls to 1/e. Set\n  |γ(τ)| = 1/e  ⇒  (π ΔνD τ)² / (4 ln 2) = 1  ⇒  τ = 2 √(ln 2) / (π ΔνD).\n- Convert to screen position:\n  xblur,coh = (c L/d) τ = (c L/d) [2 √(ln 2) / (π ΔνD)].\n- Substitute ΔνD and simplify. Since ΔνD = ν0 √(8 kB T ln 2 / (m c²)) with ν0 = c/λ1,\n  xblur,coh\n  = (c L/d) [2 √(ln 2) / (π ν0 √(8 kB T ln 2 / (m c²)))]\n  = (c L/d) [2 √(ln 2) / (π (c/λ1) √(8 kB T ln 2 / (m c²)))]\n  = (2 √(ln 2) λ1 L)/(π d √(8 kB T ln 2 / (m c²))).\n- Cancel √(ln 2) and collect constants:\n  xblur,coh = (λ1 L)/(π √2 d) √(m c² / (kB T)).\n\nEquivalently, one can introduce the coherence length at the 1/e threshold,\n  lc = c τ = 2 √(ln 2) c / (π ΔνD) = (λ1/(π √2)) √(m c²/(kB T)),\nand write xblur,coh = (L/d) lc.\n\n## Discussion and Use\n- Without a filter, the first blurring is set by the spectral doublet:\n  xbeat = L λ1 λ2 / [2 d |λ2 − λ1|].\n- With the filter passing only λ1, the first blurring is set by finite temporal coherence from Doppler broadening:\n  xblur,coh = (λ1 L)/(π √2 d) √(m c²/(kB T)).\n- In practice, before filtering the doublet effect typically dominates; after filtering, the coherence-limited distance above determines how many bright fringes are clearly visible.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe first-blur position after filtering to a single (Doppler-broadened) line λ1, using the 1/e visibility criterion, is\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,x_{\\text{blur, coh}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\lambda_{1}\\,L}{\\pi \\sqrt{2}\\; d}\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{m c^{2}}{k_{B} T}}\\,} \\]\nFor reference (no filter, two-line beat), the first zero-contrast position is xbeat = L λ1 λ2 / [2 d |λ2 − λ1|]."}

We want to stabilize the particle against small displacements in all directions by rotating both rings about the z-axis with angular speed Ω, thereby generating a magnetic field. We ignore relativistic/retardation effects, so the electric field is that of the static charge distribution, while the rotation produces a steady current and hence a magnetic field.\n\nWe must:\n- Determine the axial (z) harmonic confinement from the electrostatics of the two rings.\n- Use Laplace’s equation to relate axial and radial curvatures of the potential.\n- Add the effect of the uniform magnetic field (near the origin) generated by the rotating rings.\n- Find the minimum Ω such that the motion is stable in all directions (Penning-trap-like condition).\n\n2. Approach\n- Compute the electric potential on the z-axis from the two rings and expand near z = 0 to extract the second derivative Φ''(0).\n- From Φ''(0), determine the axial small-oscillation frequency ωz. Use Laplace’s equation to infer the radial curvature, noting that the electrostatic field alone is radially anti-confining (as in a Penning trap).\n- Compute the magnetic field Bz at the origin due to each rotating ring (current I = Q0 Ω/(2π)), then sum the contributions from the two rings.\n- Write the planar (x, y) equations of motion in the presence of a uniform Bz and the quadrupolar electric field, derive the radial stability criterion, and solve for Ωmin in terms of given parameters.\n- Note the geometric condition required for axial stability (R2 > 2l2); otherwise no Ω can stabilize the axial motion.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Electrostatic potential and axial curvature at the origin\nThe potential on the axis due to one uniformly charged ring (total charge Q0, radius R, centered at z0) is\nΦring(z) = (1/(4π ε0)) Q0 / √(R^2 + (z − z0)^2).\nWith two rings at z0 = +l and z0 = −l, the total potential on the axis is\nΦ(z) = (1/(4π ε0)) Q0 [ 1/√(R^2 + (z − l)^2) + 1/√(R^2 + (z + l)^2) ].\n\nThe first derivative at z = 0 vanishes by symmetry; the second derivative at z = 0 is\nΦ''(0) = 2 × d^2/dz^2 [ (1/(4π ε0)) Q0 1/√(R^2 + (z − l)^2) ] at z=0\n= 2 × [ − (1/(4π ε0)) Q0 (R^2 − 2l^2) / (R^2 + l^2)^{5/2} ].\n\nTherefore,\nΦ''(0) = − ( Q0 / (2π ε0) ) (R^2 − 2l^2) / (R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}.\n\nThe axial electric field near the origin is Ez ≈ −Φ''(0) z, so the axial force on the particle (charge −q) is\nFz = (−q) Ez = q Φ''(0) z.\n\nThe axial equation of motion m z¨ = Fz gives\nz¨ + ωz^2 z = 0, with ωz^2 = − (q/m) Φ''(0)\n= (q Q0) / (2π ε0 m) × (R^2 − 2l^2) / (R^2 + l^2)^{5/2}.\n\nThus, axial stability (ωz^2 > 0) demands R^2 − 2l^2 > 0, i.e., R^2 > 2 l^2.\n\nStep 2: Radial curvature from Laplace’s equation\nNear the origin, by cylindrical symmetry, the potential can be expanded as\nΦ(r, z) ≈ Φ0 + a z^2 + b r^2, with r^2 = x^2 + y^2.\nLaplace’s equation ∇^2Φ = 0 gives 2a + 4b = 0 ⇒ b = −a/2.\n\nOn-axis, Φ(z) ≈ Φ0 + (1/2) Φ''(0) z^2, so a = (1/2) Φ''(0).\nHence b = −Φ''(0)/4.\n\nThe radial electric field near the origin is Er = −∂Φ/∂r ≈ −2 b r = (Φ''(0)/2) r.\nThe radial electric force on the charge −q is Fr,E = (−q) Er = −q (Φ''(0)/2) r. Because Φ''(0) < 0 (for axial stability), the radial electric force is anti-restoring: electrostatics alone destabilizes the radial motion, as in a Penning trap.\n\nStep 3: Magnetic field from the rotating rings\nEach ring rotating with angular speed Ω carries a steady current\nI = λ v = (Q0/(2π R)) (Ω R) = Q0 Ω/(2π).\n\nThe on-axis magnetic field from one circular loop at distance |z| = l from its center is\nBz,1(0) = μ0 I R^2 / [2 (R^2 + l^2)^{3/2}].\n\nWith two identical rings (same current sense), the fields add:\nBz(0) = 2 × Bz,1(0) = μ0 I R^2 / (R^2 + l^2)^{3/2}\n= μ0 Q0 Ω R^2 / [2π (R^2 + l^2)^{3/2}].\n\nDefine the cyclotron frequency magnitude for charge q as\nωc ≡ q Bz(0) / m = q μ0 Q0 Ω R^2 / [2π m (R^2 + l^2)^{3/2}].\n\nStep 4: Radial equations of motion and stability condition\nIn the x–y plane, combining the quadrupolar electric field and the uniform Bz field, the linearized equations for the particle (actual charge −q) are\nx¨ = (ωz^2/2) x − ωc y˙,\ny¨ = (ωz^2/2) y + ωc x˙,\nwhere we used the relation ωz^2 = −(q/m) Φ''(0) and ωc = q B/m (note that the sign of the charge is already included in the derivation).\n\nSeeking normal modes x + i y ∝ e−i ω t, one obtains the quadratic equation for ω:\nω^2 + ωc ω + (ωz^2/2) = 0,\nwith solutions\nω± = [ −ωc ± √(ωc^2 − 2 ωz^2) ] / 2.\n\nFor bounded radial motion, the mode frequencies must be real, which requires\nωc^2 ≥ 2 ωz^2.\n\nStep 5: Solve for the minimum Ω\nImpose the equality ωc^2 = 2 ωz^2 at threshold:\n[ q μ0 Q0 Ω R^2 / (2π m (R^2 + l^2)^{3/2}) ]^2 = 2 × [ (q Q0)/(2π ε0 m) × (R^2 − 2l^2)/(R^2 + l^2)^{5/2} ].\n\nSolving for Ω^2,\nΩmin^2 = [4 π m / (μ0^2 ε0 q Q0 R^4)] (R^2 − 2 l^2) √(R^2 + l^2).\n\nHence,\n- Geometry requirement (axial stability): R^2 > 2 l^2.\n- For that geometry, the least rotation rate for full 3D stability is given by Ωmin above.\n\n4.

All edges have resistance r except the specific edge BC, which has resistance 2r. We are asked to find the equivalent resistance between the two adjacent vertices B and C.\n\n2) Approach\n- Separate the direct connection BC from the rest of the network: the overall equivalent between B and C is the parallel combination of the edge BC and the effective resistance R_rest between B and C through all other paths when the edge BC is removed.\n- Compute R_rest indirectly by first considering the uniform case where every edge (including BC) is r. In that uniform case, the effective resistance between adjacent vertices is known by Foster’s theorem. Relate that uniform-adjacent resistance to R_rest using a simple parallel formula, then solve for R_rest.\n- Finally, replace the edge BC by 2r and recombine in parallel with R_rest to get the desired equivalent resistance.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep A: Use Foster’s First Theorem for the uniform network\n- In a connected network of unit resistors on a graph with n vertices and m edges, Foster’s first theorem states:\n  Sum over edges {u,v} of R_eff(u,v) = n − 1.\n- The dodecahedral graph has n = 20 vertices and m = 30 edges. It is edge-transitive (all edges are equivalent by symmetry), so the effective resistance R_adj between the endpoints of any edge (when all edges are equal) is the same for all edges.\n- With unit resistors (set r = 1 temporarily), Foster’s theorem gives:\n  30 × R_adj(unit) = 20 − 1 = 19  ⇒  R_adj(unit) = 19/30.\n- By linear scaling of resistances, if each edge has resistance r, then the adjacent-vertex effective resistance scales to:\n  R_adj(all edges = r) = r × (19/30).\n\nStep B: Express R_adj via the parallel decomposition with the direct edge present\n- Let R_rest denote the equivalent resistance between B and C through the rest of the network when the edge BC is removed (all other edges remain r).\n- In the uniform case where the edge BC is also r, the equivalent between B and C is the parallel combination of r and R_rest:\n  R_adj(all edges = r) = (r · R_rest)/(r + R_rest).\n- Substitute R_adj(all edges = r) = (19/30) r and solve for R_rest:\n  (19/30) r = (r · R_rest)/(r + R_rest)\n  ⇒ (19/30) r (r + R_rest) = r · R_rest\n  ⇒ (19/30) r^2 + (19/30) r · R_rest = r · R_rest\n  ⇒ (19/30) r^2 = r · R_rest (1 − 19/30) = r · R_rest (11/30)\n  ⇒ R_rest = [(19/30)/(11/30)] r = (19/11) r.\n\nStep C: Replace the BC edge by 2r and recombine in parallel\n- Now the actual network has edge BC = 2r in parallel with R_rest = (19/11) r.

Here v0 is the first cosmic (circular-orbit) speed at the surface, so g = v0^2/R. The surface is smooth (no tangential impulse) and has a fixed coefficient of restitution ε in the normal (radial) direction, so at each bounce the normal component of velocity reverses and is reduced by a factor ε, while the tangential component remains unchanged.\n\nAs the ball makes many small hops (θ ≪ 1) around the planet, it advances in azimuth by some angle Δφ per hop, and the normal component shrinks geometrically. We are asked to find the total central angle φ accumulated before the ball effectively stops bouncing and transitions to rolling (i.e., as the normal speed tends to zero), under small-angle and constant-g approximations.\n\n### 2) Approach\n- Use a local flat-surface approximation (valid for small θ): treat motion between bounces as projectile motion under constant gravity g = v0^2/R directed radially inward.\n- Decompose the launch velocity into tangential and normal components:\n  - Tangential: v_t ≈ k v0 cosθ ≈ k v0 (to first order in θ)\n  - Normal (upward): v_r0 ≈ k v0 sinθ ≈ k v0 θ\n- Between bounces, gravity does not affect v_t (no tangential component), so v_t stays constant throughout.\n- At each bounce, the normal component after the bounce is reduced by ε: v_r(n) = ε^n v_r0.\n- For hop n, time of flight T_n = 2 v_r(n) / g, horizontal distance s_n = v_t T_n, so angular advance Δφ_n = s_n / R.\n- Sum Δφ_n over all hops (geometric series) to get total φ.\n\n### 3) Solution Steps\n1) Relation between g and v0:\n- First cosmic speed at radius R: v0 = √(gR).

Therefore:\n  Δφ_n = (k / v0) · 2 ε^n v_r0 = 2k ε^n (v_r0 / v0).\n- Substitute v_r0 ≈ k v0 θ:\n  Δφ_n = 2k ε^n (k v0 θ / v0) = 2 k^2 θ ε^n.\n\n6) Total accumulated angle:\n- Sum over all hops n = 0, 1, 2, …:\n  φ = Σ Δφ_n = Σ (2 k^2 θ ε^n) = 2 k^2 θ Σ ε^n.\n- For 0 ≤ ε < 1, Σ ε^n = 1/(1 − ε).

Because under optical conditions, the light frequency $\\omega$ is often smaller than the plasma frequency $\\omega_{p}=\\sqrt{n e^{2}/\\varepsilon_{0}m}$, it can be found that the corresponding equivalent relative permittivity of the metal is a negative real number. \n\nIf a plane electromagnetic wave at this frequency, with a relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{1}>1$ for the dielectric, enters the metal (which at this frequency has an equivalent relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{2}<0$) with a wavevector $k_{x}=\\alpha$, $k_{y}=-\\mathrm{i}\\beta$ ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are real numbers), the electric field lies in the $xy$ plane, and the interface is defined as the $y=0$ plane, with the positive $y$-axis pointing from the dielectric towards the metal, there exists a specific horizontal wavevector $k_{x}$ such that no reflected light is generated. Instead, a unique optical mode satisfying Maxwell’s equations is formed solely by the incident and refracted light—this corresponds to the surface plasmon polariton mode. \n\nHowever, in this problem, we need to consider the case where the metal actually has a relative complex permittivity $\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{2}=\\varepsilon_{21}+\\mathrm{i}\\varepsilon_{22}$, where $\\varepsilon_{21}<0$ and the imaginary part $\\varepsilon_{22}$ is a small quantity.

We are asked to find the SPP wavelength λ along x in terms of ε1, ε̃2, and the free-space wavelength λ0, using a lowest-order (small-loss) approximation.\n\n2) Approach\n- For a TM (p-polarized) SPP at a single interface, the dispersion relation for the propagation constant kx along the interface is:\n  kx = ksp = k0 sqrt( ε1 ε̃2 / (ε1 + ε̃2) ), where k0 = 2π/λ0.\n- In the presence of small loss, ksp is complex. The SPP wavelength along the interface is set by the real part of ksp:\n  λ = 2π / Re(ksp).\n- We expand ksp to first order in ε22 (small-loss expansion) and keep the lowest-order contribution to Re(ksp), which determines λ. To first order in ε22, Re(ksp) is unaffected by loss; the loss appears in Im(ksp).\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep A: SPP dispersion relation\n- For a single metal-dielectric interface (TM mode), the SPP dispersion relation is:\n  ksp = k0 sqrt( ε1 ε̃2 / (ε1 + ε̃2) ),\n  with k0 = 2π/λ0 and ε̃2 = ε21 + i ε22.\n\n- Define the complex quantity:\n  z ≡ ε1 ε̃2 / (ε1 + ε̃2).\n  Then ksp = k0 sqrt(z).\n\nStep B: Small-loss expansion\n- Let D ≡ ε1 + ε21 (a real number). For an SPP to exist in the lossless limit, we require ε21 < −ε1 so that D < 0 and the real part of z is positive.\n- Write:\n  z = ε1 (ε21 + i ε22) / (D + i ε22).\n- Expand to first order in ε22:\n  1/(D + i ε22) = 1/D · 1/(1 + i ε22/D) ≈ 1/D · (1 − i ε22/D) + O(ε22^2).\n- Therefore:\n  z ≈ ε1 (ε21 + i ε22) [ 1/D − i ε22/D^2 ] + O(ε22^2)\n    = ε1 [ ε21/D + i ε22/D − i ε21 ε22/D^2 ] + O(ε22^2)\n    = ε1 ε21/D + i ε1 ε22 (1/D − ε21/D^2) + O(ε22^2).\n- Noting 1/D − ε21/D^2 = (D − ε21)/D^2 = ε1/D^2, we get:\n  z ≈ a + i b, with\n  a = ε1 ε21 / (ε1 + ε21),\n  b = ε1^2 ε22 / (ε1 + ε21)^2.\n\n- Since ε21 < −ε1, we have D < 0, numerator ε1 ε21 < 0, hence a > 0, which ensures a real positive square root for the lossless part.\n\nStep C: Square root to first order in ε22\n- For small b relative to a, use:\n  sqrt(a + i b) ≈ sqrt(a) + i b / [2 sqrt(a)] + O(b^2).\n- Thus:\n  ksp = k0 sqrt(z) ≈ k0 [ sqrt(a) + i b/(2 sqrt(a)) ].\n- Therefore:\n  Re(ksp) ≈ k0 sqrt(a) to first order in ε22.\n\nStep D: Wavelength along the interface\n- The SPP wavelength (distance between phase fronts along x) is:\n  λ = 2π / Re(ksp) ≈ 2π / [ k0 sqrt(a) ] = λ0 / sqrt(a).\n- Substitute a:\n  a = ε1 ε21 / (ε1 + ε21).\n  Hence,\n  λ ≈ λ0 sqrt( (ε1 + ε21) / (ε1 ε21) ).\n\n- Interpretation:\n  • To lowest order in the metal loss (ε22), the wavelength depends only on the real part ε21 of the metal permittivity; loss affects the attenuation (Im(ksp)) but not the wavelength at first order.\n  • The condition ε21 < −ε1 ensures the argument of the square root is positive and an SPP exists.\n\n4) Final Answer\n- Using the dispersion relation ksp = k0 sqrt( ε1 ε̃2 / (ε1 + ε̃2) ) and expanding to first order in ε22 ≪ |ε21|, the SPP wavelength along the interface is, to lowest order:\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\lambda \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\,\\dfrac{\\varepsilon_{1}\\,\\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_{1}+\\varepsilon_{21}}\\,}} \\;=\\; \\lambda_{0}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{1}+\\varepsilon_{21}}{\\varepsilon_{1}\\,\\varepsilon_{21}}} \\quad \\text{(to first order in }\\varepsilon_{22}\\text{)} } \\]"}

The motion is relativistic when ωρ approaches c, with ρ the cylindrical radius. We want the total radiated power per unit length of the rod as measured in a frame S′ moving along the z-axis at speed βc relative to S. Radiation from different charges is assumed incoherent, so powers add directly. We must compute this in S′ without using global energy/power transformation laws, i.e., by summing the Liénard (relativistic Larmor) power per charge in S′ over all charges within one unit length in S′.\n\n2) Approach\n- Compute the instantaneous power radiated by a single charge at radius ρ as seen in S′ using the Liénard formula. To do so, relate the velocity and acceleration components in S′ to those in S for a boost along z.\n- Show that in S′ the velocity and acceleration remain perpendicular (v′ · a′ = 0), so the Liénard power simplifies.\n- Express the per-charge power P′(ρ) in terms of ω, ρ, and the Lorentz factor γ(ρ) = 1/√(1 − (ωρ/c)^2) associated with the transverse rotational speed in S. We will see this equals the same per-charge value as in S.\n- Use number density transformation along the boost direction: n′ = γb n (with γb = 1/√(1 − β^2)) because there is no axial current in S.\n- Sum incoherently over charges in a unit length dz′ = 1 of S′ by integrating over the transverse cross section with density n′.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nA) Single-particle kinematics in S\n- For a charge at radius ρ:\n  - Speed: v⊥ = ωρ\n  - Lorentz factor associated with its rotational motion:\n    γ(ρ) = 1 / √(1 − (ωρ/c)^2)\n  - For uniform circular motion, the lab-frame (S) centripetal acceleration magnitude is\n    a⊥(S) = γ(ρ)^2 v⊥^2 / ρ = γ(ρ)^2 ω^2 ρ\n  - The acceleration is everywhere perpendicular to the velocity (radial versus tangential), so v ⊥ a.\n\nB) Transform to S′ (boost along z at βc)\n- Velocity components:\n  - v′⊥ = v⊥ / γb  (since v_z = 0 in S)\n  - v′z = −βc\n  - Total Lorentz factor in S′ for the particle:\n    γ′ = 1 / √(1 − v′2/c^2) = γb γ(ρ)\n    (Use 1 − v′2/c^2 = 1 − β^2 − v⊥^2/(γb^2 c^2) = (1/γb^2)(1 − v⊥^2/c^2).)\n- Acceleration components for this special case (boost along z, no axial acceleration in S):\n  - a′z = 0\n  - a′⊥ = a⊥ / γb^2\n- Orthogonality in S′:\n  - a′ lies in the transverse plane; v′ has transverse (tangential) and longitudinal (−z) parts. The transverse v′⊥ is tangential and still perpendicular to the radial a′⊥; the longitudinal part is also perpendicular to a′. Hence v′ · a′ = 0.\n\nC) Per-charge radiated power in S′\n- Liénard power (as given):\n  P′ = (γ′^6 q^2 / (6π ε0 c^3)) [ a′2 − (v′ × a′)^2 / c^2 ].\n- With v′ ⊥ a′, we have (v′ × a′)^2 = v′2 a′2, so the bracket becomes a′2 (1 − v′2/c^2) = a′2 / γ′2. Therefore\n  P′(ρ) = (q^2 γ′^4 a′2)/(6π ε0 c^3).\n- Substitute γ′ = γb γ(ρ) and a′ = a⊥/γb^2 with a⊥ = γ(ρ)^2 ω^2 ρ:\n  P′(ρ) = (q^2 (γb γ(ρ))^4 (a⊥^2/γb^4)) / (6π ε0 c^3)\n         = (q^2 γ(ρ)^4 a⊥^2)/(6π ε0 c^3)\n         = (q^2 γ(ρ)^4 (γ(ρ)^2 ω^2 ρ)^2)/(6π ε0 c^3)\n         = q^2 ω^4 ρ^2 γ(ρ)^8 / (6π ε0 c^3).\n- Thus, per charge, P′(ρ) equals the same functional form as in S for uniform circular motion. The boost along z changes v and a magnitudes but in just the way that cancels in the combination γ′4 a′2.\n\nD) Number density in S′ and power per unit length\n- In S there is no axial current (v_z = 0). For a boost along z, the charge number density transforms as\n  n′ = γb n.\n  (Equivalently, ρ′ = γb ρ for the proper charge density, since J_z = 0 in S.)\n- Radiation is incoherent, so the total power per unit length along z′ is the area integral over the cross-section times n′:\n  dP′/dz′ = ∫_0^R (n′ 2πρ dρ) P′(ρ)\n           = ∫_0^R (γb n 2πρ dρ) [ q^2 ω^4 ρ^2 γ(ρ)^8 / (6π ε0 c^3) ]\n           = (γb n q^2 ω^4)/(3 ε0 c^3) ∫_0^R ρ^3 γ(ρ)^8 dρ.\n\nE) Radial integral\n- Write γ(ρ)^8 = [1 − (ωρ/c)^2]^{-4}.

A magnetic dipole of fixed orientation and magnitude m is located on the axis of the ring at distance h from its center. The ring is allowed to rotate only about a diameter through its center.\n- Initially, the ring’s plane is perpendicular to the dipole moment direction (so the ring’s axis is aligned with the dipole moment). The current in the ring produces at the dipole’s location a magnetic field aligned with the dipole moment (stable configuration).\n- The ring is given a small angular displacement about the diameter. We are to find the period T1 of the resulting small-amplitude (simple harmonic) oscillation.\n\n2) Approach\n- Use the magnetic interaction energy between the fixed dipole and the magnetic field produced by the current ring: U = −m·B at the dipole’s location.\n- Near the aligned configuration (small tilt angle θ about a diameter), the energy has the form U(θ) ≈ −m B0 cos θ, where B0 is the field of the ring at the dipole’s location when the ring’s axis is aligned with the dipole.\n- Expand U for small θ to identify an effective torsional spring constant κ.

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$. It can be proved that $\\vec{B}_{0}$ is conserved (the proof method is unknown), and the expression for $|\\vec{B}_{0}|$ can be determined (unknown quantity).\n\nHint 2: The precession angle is defined as the rotation angle of the closest point during a single period of the planet.

Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure.

Each wire has resistance per unit length λ, so each loop has total resistance 2πRλ.\n- The sphere is set into pure rolling with initial center-of-mass speed v0 on the horizontal plane. Because the sphere rotates in the magnetic field, each loop experiences an induced EMF, causing currents and ohmic dissipation.\n- Goal: Find how the translational speed v(t) subsequently changes.\n\nKey physical ideas:\n- Faraday’s law for a rotating loop: EMF equals the time rate of change of magnetic flux, or equivalently the motional EMF ∮(v × B)·dl.\n- Energy balance: in pure rolling, static friction does no work; mechanical energy loss equals ohmic heating in the loops.\n\nSection 2: Approach\n1. Model each great-circle loop as a rigid loop with area A = πR^2 and normal n̂i (i = 1,2,3, forming an orthonormal triad fixed in the body).\n2. For rigid-body rotation with angular velocity ω, compute the EMF in each loop using e_i = −dΦ_i/dt, where Φ_i = AB (n̂i · ẑ), with ẑ the vertical (B direction).\n3.

We must determine the magnitude |m′|.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use the method of images in magnetostatics with scalar potential:\n  - Choose the z-axis along the dipole moment m and place the real dipole at z = a.\n  - Expand the scalar potential of the external dipole (at z = a) in Legendre polynomials Pℓ(cosθ), valid for r < a (which includes the sphere’s surface r = R).\n  - Represent the image field by a dipole m′ located at z = b (to be determined) inside the sphere; expand its potential for r > b (again valid at r = R).\n  - Impose the Meissner boundary condition at r = R: Br = 0 ⇔ ∂Φ/∂r = 0.\n  - Match coefficients of Pℓ(cosθ) for all ℓ ≥ 1, which yields relations for b and m′. The requirement that the boundary condition holds for all ℓ forces two ℓ-independent relations: ab = R^2 and m′ = −m (R^3/a^3).\n- Conclude the magnitude |m′| = m (R^3/a^3).\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Scalar potential of a dipole\n- In vacuum, with H = −∇Φ and B = μ0 H, the scalar potential of a dipole m at the origin (aligned with ẑ) is\n  Φdip,0 = m cosθ / (4π r^2),\n  which produces the given induction field B = μ0 m/(4π r^3) [2 cosθ er + sinθ eθ].\n\n- For a dipole m ẑ located at z = a (outside the sphere), the scalar potential at a field point (r, θ), with r < a, can be expanded using the addition theorem:\n  1/|r − r0| = ∑_{ℓ=0}^∞ (r^ℓ / a^{ℓ+1}) Pℓ(cosθ), with r0 = a ẑ.\n  Using Φ = m ∂/∂z0 [ (1/4π) 1/|r − r0| ] = m ∂/∂a [ (1/4π) 1/|r − r0| ],\n  we obtain for r < a:\n  Φm(r, θ) = (m/4π) ∑_{ℓ=0}^∞ ∂/∂a [ r^ℓ a^{−(ℓ+1)} Pℓ(cosθ) ]\n             = − (m/4π) ∑_{ℓ=1}^∞ (ℓ + 1) (r^ℓ / a^{ℓ+2}) Pℓ(cosθ).\n  (The ℓ = 0 term contributes only a constant, irrelevant for H = −∇Φ.)\n\nStep 2: Scalar potential of the image dipole inside\n- Place the image dipole m′ ẑ at z = b (with 0 < b < R). For r > b (in particular at r = R), expand:\n  1/|r − r0′| = ∑_{ℓ=0}^∞ (b^ℓ / r^{ℓ+1}) Pℓ(cosθ),\n  hence\n  Φm′(r, θ) = m′ ∂/∂b [ (1/4π) ∑_{ℓ=0}^∞ (b^ℓ / r^{ℓ+1}) Pℓ(cosθ) ]\n             = (m′/4π) ∑_{ℓ=1}^∞ ℓ (b^{ℓ−1} / r^{ℓ+1}) Pℓ(cosθ).\n\nStep 3: Apply boundary condition Br(R, θ) = 0\n- With H = −∇Φ, the radial component is Hr = −∂Φ/∂r. The Meissner condition Br(R, θ) = 0 implies Hr(R, θ) = 0, i.e.,\n  ∂Φm/∂r + ∂Φm′/∂r evaluated at r = R equals 0.\n- Compute the derivatives at r = R:\n  ∂Φm/∂r |_{R} = − (m/4π) ∑_{ℓ=1}^∞ (ℓ + 1) ℓ (R^{ℓ−1} / a^{ℓ+2}) Pℓ(cosθ),\n  ∂Φm′/∂r |_{R} = − (m′/4π) ∑_{ℓ=1}^∞ ℓ (ℓ + 1) (b^{ℓ−1} / R^{ℓ+2}) Pℓ(cosθ).\n\n- Setting their sum to zero and matching coefficients of Pℓ(cosθ) for each ℓ ≥ 1 gives:\n  − (m/4π) (ℓ + 1) ℓ (R^{ℓ−1} / a^{ℓ+2}) − (m′/4π) ℓ (ℓ + 1) (b^{ℓ−1} / R^{ℓ+2}) = 0,\n  which simplifies (after canceling common factors) to:\n  m R^{ℓ−1} a^{−(ℓ+2)} + m′ b^{ℓ−1} R^{−(ℓ+2)} = 0.\n\n- Solve for m′:\n  m′ = − m R^{2ℓ+1} / (a^{ℓ+2} b^{ℓ−1})\n     = − m (R^2/(a b))^ℓ (R b / a^2).\n\n- For this to hold for all ℓ, the ℓ-dependent factor must be unity:\n  R^2/(a b) = 1  ⇒  a b = R^2.\n- With this, m′ becomes ℓ-independent:\n  m′ = − m (R b / a^2).\n  Using b = R^2 / a,\n  m′ = − m (R (R^2/a) / a^2) = − m (R^3 / a^3).\n\n- Interpretation: m′ is antiparallel to m (negative sign) so that Br(R, θ) = 0. The problem asks for the magnitude, so\n  |m′| = m (R^3 / a^3).\n\n- (Optional) The image dipole’s location is at z = b with b = R^2 / a.\n\n4. Key Concept Notes\n- Meissner effect: A superconductor expels magnetic induction (B = 0 inside). At the surface, the normal component of B must vanish (Br = 0). In regions without currents, H = −∇Φ and Laplace’s equation applies; the boundary condition becomes a Neumann condition on Φ.\n- Method of images: For symmetric boundary value problems of Laplace’s equation, one can replace the boundary by suitable image sources to satisfy boundary conditions exactly. Uniqueness guarantees correctness once the boundary condition is met.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,|m'| \\;=\\; m\\,\\left(\\dfrac{R}{a}\\right)^{3}\\,} \\]"}

For a given circumferential order m, the ring supports two degenerate traveling waves (clockwise and counterclockwise) with the same natural frequency ωm when Ω = 0.\n- When the ring spins slowly (Ω ≪ ωm), the degeneracy is lifted by rotation (via Coriolis/gyroscopic effect), so the two traveling waves of order m acquire slightly different frequencies.

To first order in Ω (neglect Ω^2):\n  ωm,+rot = ωm − mΩ (for the +m wave),\n  ωm,−rot = ωm + mΩ (for the −m wave).\n- Thus the rotational splitting (in the rotating frame) is\n  Δω = ωm,+rot − ωm,−rot = −2 m Ω.\n\nStep C: Standing wave and precession of antinodes\n- In the rotating frame, the standing wave built from the split traveling waves is\n  u(θ, t) = A cos(mθ − ωm,+rot t) + A cos(−mθ − ωm,−rot t)\n           = A cos(mθ − (ωm − mΩ) t) + A cos(mθ + (ωm + mΩ) t).\n- Use the identity cos α + cos β = 2 cos[(α+β)/2] cos[(α−β)/2]:\n  α = mθ − ωm t + mΩ t,  β = mθ + ωm t + mΩ t\n  ⇒ (α+β)/2 = mθ + mΩ t,   (α−β)/2 = −ωm t.\n- Therefore,\n  u(θ, t) = 2A cos(mθ + mΩ t) cos(ωm t).\n- The fast factor cos(ωm t) is the vibration at ωm; the slow angular envelope is cos(mθ + mΩ t).\n- Antinodes occur at\n  mθ + mΩ t = const  ⇒  θ(t) = −Ω t + const/m.\n- Hence, the nodal/antinodal pattern precesses at the constant angular rate\n  δω = −Ω\n  in the rotating frame. The sign is negative relative to the positive direction defined as the spin direction, i.e., the pattern drifts retrograde with respect to the rotation.\n\nStep D: Compact expression via beat-frequency formula\n- More generally, for any symmetric pair of counter-propagating waves with frequencies ω+ and ω− in the same frame, the standing-wave orientation angle advances at the rate\n  δω = (ω+ − ω−)/(2m).\n- Using ω+ − ω− = −2 m Ω gives δω = −Ω.\n\nRemarks\n- The result is independent of material parameters (E, ρ, R, r) and of m (provided m ≥ 2 so that a genuine elastic mode exists). It relies only on axial symmetry and Ω ≪ ωm so that Ω^2 effects can be neglected.\n- Physically, the two counter-propagating waves are Doppler-shifted in opposite senses in the co-rotating frame, producing a slow retrograde drift of the standing pattern at the spin rate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\delta\\omega \\;=\\; -\\,\\Omega} \\]"}

"improved_solutions": "1) Problem Analysis\nWe are given a one-component simple p–v–T system (one mole) with the following properties:\n\n- Thermal expansion coefficient α = (1/v)(∂v/∂T)p = 3/T (state function specified).\n- Adiabats are described by p v^2 = constant.\n- Isobaric heat capacity has the form c_p ∝ p v / T with a state-independent proportionality constant.\n- We are asked to compute the entropy change S_D − S_A between two states A and D, given (p_A, v_A, T_A) and (p_D, v_D).\n\nThe task is to determine the equation of state consistent with the given response functions, fix the proportionality constant in c_p, obtain S as a state function, and finally express the entropy change between states A and D in terms of the given endpoint data only.\n\n2) Approach\n- Use α = 3/T to obtain the T-dependence of v at fixed p.\n- Use the adiabatic relation p v^2 = const to find the adiabatic compressibility κ_S and relate it to the isothermal compressibility κ_T via standard thermodynamic identities.\n- Employ the identities c_p − c_v = T v α^2/κ_T and κ_T/κ_S = c_p/c_v to fix the constant in c_p ∝ p v/T and determine κ_T.\n- From α and κ_T, determine the equation of state v(T,p).\n- Compute dS = c_p dT/T − α v dp and show it is exact; integrate to get S(p,T).\n- Eliminate the material constant using the given endpoint data to obtain S_D − S_A in terms of (p_A, v_A, T_A) and (p_D, v_D).\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep 1: Consequence of α = 3/T\nBy definition, α = (1/v)(∂v/∂T)p. Given α = 3/T, integrate at fixed p:\n\n(1/v)(∂v/∂T)p = 3/T ⇒ ∂ ln v = 3 ∂ ln T ⇒ ln v = 3 ln T + g(p),\n\nso the specific form is\nv(T,p) = T^3 h(p),\nfor some positive function h(p). This fixes the T-dependence of v but leaves the p-dependence to be determined.\n\nStep 2: Adiabatic compressibility\nThe adiabatic paths satisfy p v^2 = const. Differentiating v ∝ p^(-1/2) along S = const gives\n\n(∂v/∂p)S = −(1/2) v/p ⇒ κ_S ≡ −(1/v)(∂v/∂p)S = 1/(2 p).\n\nThus κ_S is completely determined by the given adiabat equation.\n\nStep 3: Thermodynamic identities and the form of c_p\nWe will use two standard one-component identities:\n\n- c_p − c_v = T v α^2 / κ_T,\n- κ_T/κ_S = c_p/c_v.\n\nWe are told c_p = k (p v)/T, where k is a state-independent dimensionless constant to be determined. Let X ≡ p v/T. Then c_p = k X, and from κ_T/κ_S = c_p/c_v we have\n\nc_v = c_p/(κ_T/κ_S) = c_p/(2 p κ_T).\n\nUsing c_p − c_v = T v α^2/κ_T with α = 3/T gives\nk X − k X/(2 p κ_T) = 9 v/(T κ_T) = 9 X/(p κ_T).\n\nDivide by X (X > 0) to obtain a relation between k and y ≡ p κ_T:\nk [1 − 1/(2 y)] = 9 / y ⇒ k (y − 1/2) = 9.  (1)\n\nSo far, we know κ_T must scale as 1/p (i.e., y is a constant) to keep k state-independent. Write κ_T = A/p with some constant A; then y = A and (1) becomes\n\nk (A − 1/2) = 9.  (2)\n\nStep 4: Ensure entropy is a state function (exactness of dS)\nWith v = T^3 h(p), α = 3/T, and c_p = k p v/T, the fundamental relation for changes in entropy is\n\ndS = c_p dT/T − α v dp = k (p v/T) dT/T − (3/T) v dp.\n\nSubstitute v = T^3 h(p):\n\ndS = k p (T^3 h)/T · dT/T − 3 T^3 h · (dp/T)\n= k h T p^{ } · dT − 3 h T^2 dp\n= M(p,T) dT + N(p,T) dp,\n\nwith M = k h T p and N = −3 h T^2.\n\nThe exactness condition (∂M/∂p)T = (∂N/∂T)p gives\n\n∂M/∂p = k T [h'(p) p + h(p)] = ∂N/∂T = −6 h T.\n\nDivide by T:\n\nk [p h'(p) + h(p)] = −6 h(p).\n\nUsing κ_T = −(1/v)(∂v/∂p)T = −h'(p)/h(p), and κ_T = A/p, we have p h'(p) = −A h(p). Insert into the exactness condition:\n\nk [−A h + h] = −6 h ⇒ k (1 − A) = −6 ⇒ k (A − 1) = 6.  (3)\n\nSolve (2) and (3) simultaneously:\n\nFrom (3): k = 6/(A − 1). Plug into (2):\n[6/(A − 1)] (A − 1/2) = 9 ⇒ 6 (A − 1/2) = 9 (A − 1)\n⇒ 6A − 3 = 9A − 9 ⇒ 6 = 3A ⇒ A = 2,\nand then k = 6.\n\nTherefore,\nκ_T = 2/p,  c_p = 6 (p v)/T.\n\nStep 5: Equation of state\nWe already have v = T^3 h(p) and κ_T = −h'/h = 2/p. Integrate:\n\nd ln h/d ln p = −2 ⇒ h(p) = b p^{−2},\n\nwhere b is a positive, state-independent constant for the substance. Thus the equation of state is\n\nv(T,p) = b T^3 / p^2.  (EoS)\n\nStep 6: Entropy as a state function and its change\nWith c_p = 6 p v/T and α = 3/T, compute dS and integrate:\n\ndS = c_p dT/T − α v dp\n= 6 (p v/T) dT/T − 3 (v/T) dp.\n\nUse the EoS to express p v/T and v/T:\n\np v/T = p (b T^3/p^2)/T = b T^2/p,\nv/T = (b T^3/p^2)/T = b T^2/p^2.\n\nThen\ndS = 6 (b T^2/p) dT/T − 3 (b T^2/p^2) dp\n= 6 b (T/p) dT − 3 b (T^2/p^2) dp\n= d[3 b T^2/p].\n\nHence an explicit entropy function is\nS(p,T) = 3 b T^2 / p + const.\n\nTherefore, between states A and D,\nS_D − S_A = 3 b (T_D^2/p_D − T_A^2/p_A).  (4)\n\nTo eliminate the material constant b, use the EoS at state A (or D). From v = b T^3/p^2,\nb = v_A p_A^2 / T_A^3.\n\nAlso, if needed, T_D can be expressed from p_D, v_D by T_D = (v_D p_D^2 / b)^{1/3}.\n\nEliminating b and T_D gives a fully explicit formula in terms of the given endpoint data:\n\nT^2/p = (v^{2/3} p^{1/3})/b^{2/3} ⇒\nS_D − S_A = 3 b^{1/3}[(p_D v_D^2)^{1/3} − (p_A v_A^2)^{1/3}].\n\nWith b^{1/3} fixed by state A as b^{1/3} = v_A^{1/3} p_A^{2/3}/T_A, we obtain\n\nS_D − S_A = 3 (v_A^{1/3} p_A^{2/3}/T_A) [ (p_D v_D^2)^{1/3} − (p_A v_A^2)^{1/3} ].\n\nThis expression depends only on the given (p_A, v_A, T_A) and (p_D, v_D).\n\nChecks:\n- c_p = 6 p v/T and κ_T = 2/p imply c_p − c_v = T v α^2/κ_T = (9/2) (p v)/T, so c_v = c_p − (9/2)(p v)/T = (6 − 4.5)(p v)/T = 1.5 (p v)/T, and hence c_p/c_v = 6/1.5 = 4. This equals κ_T/κ_S = (2/p)/(1/(2p)) = 4, consistent.\n- Adiabats derived from dS = 0: 0 = 6 b T/p dT − 3 b T^2/p^2 dp ⇒ 2 p dT = T dp ⇒ d ln T = (1/2) d ln p ⇒ T ∝ p^{1/2}. Using v = b T^3/p^2 then gives v ∝ p^{3/2}/p^2 = p^{−1/2}, i.e., p v^2 = const, as required.\n\n4) Final Answer\nThe system’s equation of state, heat capacity, and entropy function are\n- v(T,p) = b T^3 / p^2,\n- c_p = 6 (p v)/T,\n- S(p,T) = 3 b T^2 / p + const,\n\nwith b a constant characteristic of the substance. The entropy change between D and A is\n\n- In terms of p and T:\nS_D − S_A = 3 b (T_D^2/p_D − T_A^2/p_A).\n\n- Eliminating b using the A-state data (b = v_A p_A^2/T_A^3) and expressing everything in terms of (p_A, v_A, T_A) and (p_D, v_D):\nS_D − S_A = 3 (v_A^{1/3} p_A^{2/3}/T_A) [ (p_D v_D^2)^{1/3} − (p_A v_A^2)^{1/3} ].\n\nEither form is correct; the second uses only the given endpoint data.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,S_D - S_A \\;=\\; 3\\,\\frac{v_A^{1/3} p_A^{2/3}}{T_A}\\,\\Big[\\,\\big(p_D v_D^{2}\\big)^{1/3} \\;-\\; \\big(p_A v_A^{2}\\big)^{1/3}\\,\\Big]\\,}\n\\]"}

Approach\n- Use linear hydrostatic-response (Love number) theory for a homogeneous incompressible fluid sphere.\n- Expand the free-surface shape as a small degree-2 spherical harmonic perturbation:\n  r_s(θ) = R + ξ(θ) = R + A P2(cosθ), with P2(cosθ) = (3cos^2θ − 1)/2, and |A| ≪ R.\n- The surface must be an equipotential under the sum of (i) the centrifugal potential (degree-2 part) and (ii) the ring’s gravitational tidal potential (degree-2 part).\n- The radial displacement for a degree-2 disturbing potential U2 is ξ = h2 U2/g at the surface, where h2 = 5/2 for a uniform incompressible fluid, and g = GM/R^2 is the surface gravity with M = ρ(4/3)πR^3.\n- Extract the coefficient A, relate it to the geometric flattening f = (a − b)/a to first order, then convert f to eccentricity e using e^2 ≈ 2f for small flattening.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\n3.1. Geometry of the shape perturbation\n- With r_s(θ) = R + A P2(cosθ):\n  - At the pole (θ = 0): P2(1) = 1 ⇒ b = R + A.\n  - At the equator (θ = π/2): P2(0) = −1/2 ⇒ a = R − A/2.\n- The geometric flattening f ≡ (a − b)/a becomes, to first order in |A|/R,\n  f = [ (R − A/2) − (R + A) ] / (R − A/2) ≈ (−3A/2)/R. \n  Therefore, an oblate figure (a > b) corresponds to A < 0.\n\n3.2. Degree-2 disturbing potentials at r = R\n\n- Define P2(cosθ) = (3cos^2θ − 1)/2.\n\n(a) Rotation\n- Centrifugal potential: V_rot = −(1/2) ω^2 R^2 sin^2θ.\n- Expand V_rot into degree-0 and degree-2 parts. Using sin^2θ = 1 − cos^2θ and cos^2θ = (2P2 + 1)/3,\n  V_rot = const + (1/3) ω^2 R^2 P2(cosθ).\n- In the standard tidal-response convention, the disturbing potential that drives the surface displacement is U2,rot = −V2,rot (so that a negative at the equator yields outward bulge there). Hence:\n  U2,rot = −(1/3) ω^2 R^2 P2(cosθ).\n\n(b) Ring (moon model)\n- The degree-2 tidal potential from a point mass m at distance r is U2,pm = (G m R^2/r^3) P2(cosψ), where ψ is the angle from the planet–moon line.\n- A uniform ring in the equatorial plane is the azimuthal average of such point masses around the equator. Averaging P2(cosψ) over azimuthal angle gives\n  ⟨P2(cosψ)⟩ = −(1/2) P2(cosθ),\n  so that the ring’s degree-2 disturbing potential at r = R is\n  U2,ring = −(1/2) (G m R^2 / r^3) P2(cosθ).\n\n- Total degree-2 disturbing potential:\n  U2,total = [ −(1/3) ω^2 R^2 − (1/2) (G m R^2 / r^3) ] P2(cosθ).\n\n3.3. Hydrostatic radial displacement and the amplitude A\n- For a homogeneous incompressible sphere, the degree-2 displacement at the surface is\n  ξ(θ) = h2 U2,total / g, with h2 = 5/2 and g = GM/R^2.\n- Therefore the amplitude A (coefficient of P2) is\n  A = h2 Û2 / g,\n  where Û2 = −(1/3) ω^2 R^2 − (1/2) (G m R^2 / r^3)\n  is the angular-independent coefficient of P2.\n  Hence\n  A = − (h2 R^2 / g) [ (1/3) ω^2 + (1/2) (G m / r^3) ].\n\n3.4. Flattening f and its decomposition\n- Using f ≈ (−3A/2)/R,\n  f = (3 h2 R / 2 g) [ (1/3) ω^2 + (1/2) (G m / r^3) ].\n- Substitute h2 = 5/2 and g = GM/R^2:\n  f = ( (3)(5/2) R / (2 GM/R^2) ) [ (1/3) ω^2 + (1/2) (G m / r^3) ]\n    = (5 R^3 / (2 GM)) [ (1/2) ω^2 + (3/4) (G m / r^3) ].\n- Separate the rotational and ring contributions:\n  f = (5/4) (ω^2 R^3 / GM) + (15/8) (G m R^3 / GM r^3)\n    = (5/4) (ω^2 R^3 / GM) + (15/8) (m/M) (R^3 / r^3).\n- Using M = (4/3) π ρ R^3, we can also write\n  f = (15 / 16π G ρ) ω^2 + (45 m / 32π ρ r^3).\n\n3.5. Eccentricity e from flattening f\n- For a weakly oblate spheroid (small f), the relation between eccentricity and flattening is\n  e^2 = 1 − (b^2/a^2) = 1 − (1 − f)^2 ≈ 2 f,\n  so e ≈ √(2 f).\n- Therefore\n  e ≈ sqrt[ (5/2) (ω^2 R^3 / GM) + (15/4) (m/M) (R^3 / r^3) ].\n- Equivalently, in terms of ρ:\n  e ≈ sqrt[ (15/(8π G ρ)) ω^2 + (45/(16π ρ)) (m / r^3) ].\n\nChecks and remarks:\n- If m = 0 (no ring), this reduces to the classical small-rotation Maclaurin result f = (5/4)q with q = ω^2 R^3/(GM), and e ≈ √(2f) = √(5/2 q).\n- The ring contribution adds linearly (to first order) to rotational flattening because both forcings are degree-2 and axisymmetric.\n- Valid for small deformations (|A| ≪ R), homogeneous incompressible Earth, and r ≫ R.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\ne \\;\\approx\\; \\sqrt{\\,\\frac{5}{2}\\,\\frac{\\omega^{2} R^{3}}{G M}\\;+\\;\\frac{15}{4}\\,\\frac{m}{M}\\,\\frac{R^{3}}{r^{3}}\\,}\n\\;=\\;\n\\sqrt{\\,\\frac{15}{8\\pi G \\rho}\\,\\omega^{2}\\;+\\;\\frac{45}{16\\pi \\rho}\\,\\frac{m}{r^{3}}\\,}\n}\n\\]"}

Because the polarization carries bound charges, rotation generates azimuthal currents and, in turn, a magnetic field. The electromagnetic field stores energy and carries angular momentum, which effectively increases the rotational inertia.\n- Goal: Find the angular acceleration β under the applied torque M, accounting for both mechanical and electromagnetic contributions to the moment of inertia.\n\n2) Approach\n- Electrostatics: With no free charges, use D = ε0 E + P and ∇·D = 0 to find the electric field E.\n- Magnetostatics under rotation: The rotating bound charge distribution produces an azimuthal current density Jφ that creates an axial magnetic field Bz(r). Solve for Bz(r) via Ampère’s law (curl form).\n- Electromagnetic inertia: Compute the magnetic field energy U = ∫ B^2/(2μ0) dV. Since B ∝ ω, the magnetic energy is quadratic in angular speed ω, allowing us to define an electromagnetic moment of inertia I_em via U = (1/2) I_em ω^2. Alternatively, confirm with field angular momentum L_em = ∫ r × (ε0 E × B) dV = I_em ω.\n- Dynamics: The torque equals the rate of change of total rotational kinetic energy, giving M = (I_mech + I_em) β, where I_mech = (1/2) m R^2. Solve for β.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep A: Electric field inside and outside the cylinder\n- No free charge: ∇·D = 0 with D = ε0 E + P.\n- Cylindrical symmetry (very long cylinder) implies D = D_r(r) r̂ and\n  (1/r) d/dr [r D_r(r)] = 0 ⇒ r D_r = const.\n- Regularity at r = 0 (finite D_r) forces const = 0, hence D_r = 0 inside. Outside (vacuum) and far from the cylinder, D must vanish as well, so D_r^out = 0.\n- Therefore, inside the dielectric (r ≤ R):\n  ε0 E_r + P_r = 0 ⇒ E_r(r) = - P_r(r)/ε0 = - P0 e^{k r} / ε0.\n  Outside (r ≥ R): E_r = 0.\n\nStep B: Bound charge and azimuthal current due to rotation\n- Bound charge density: ρ_b = -∇·P. For P = P_r(r) r̂,\n  ∇·P = (1/r) d/dr [ r P_r(r) ] ⇒ ρ_b(r) = - (1/r) d/dr [ r P_r(r) ].\n- Rigid rotation with angular velocity ω gives v = ω r φ̂, so bound current density\n  J_φ(r) = ρ_b(r) v_φ = ρ_b(r) ω r = - ω d/dr [ r P_r(r) ] (for r < R).\n- There is also a bound surface charge at r = R: σ_b = P·n = P_r(R) = P0 e^{k R}, which moves with speed ωR and produces a surface current K_φ = σ_b ω R.\n\nStep C: Axial magnetic field Bz(r)\n- Axisymmetry suggests only Bz(r) is nonzero. The φ-component of Ampère’s law in magnetostatics is\n  (∇ × B)_φ = - dB_z/dr = μ0 J_φ.\n  Hence,\n  dB_z/dr = μ0 ω d/dr [ r P_r(r) ].\n- Integrate radially: B_z(r) = μ0 ω r P_r(r) + C (inside).\n- Outside the cylinder (r > R), there is no volume current, so dB_z/dr = 0 ⇒ B_z = constant. The jump at r = R due to the surface current K_φ is\n  B_z(R^+) - B_z(R^-) = - μ0 K_φ = - μ0 ω R P_r(R).\n- Requiring B_z → 0 at large r (finite energy) gives B_z(r ≥ R) = 0 and thus C = 0.

This continuously increases the rest mass but, under the given assumption m0 ≫ ρ A R, the accumulated mass along the path is small so we may take the rest mass as approximately constant M ≈ m0 while still accounting for the angular-momentum drain caused by accretion.\n- The only torque about the center comes from the momentum imparted to dust in the tangential direction.\n- Initially the radius is R0; we are to find the time t for the radius to change to R.

Then v^2 = k R^2 / Q and\n  β^2 = v^2/c^2 = k R^2 / (Q c^2),  γ = Q/M.\n\nRelativistic consistency requires γ = 1/√(1 − β^2) together with β^2 above.

{"id": "MECHANICS/648", "questions": "In a vacuum, there are concentric spherical shells made of insulating material with radii $R$ and $2R$. The inner shell is uniformly charged with a total charge of $Q(Q>0)$, while the outer shell is uncharged. There is also a small insulating sphere with a charge of $+q(q>0)$ and a mass $m$, which can be launched from a point on the inner shell with a certain velocity. The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center.

The inner shell carries total charge Q > 0; the outer shell is uncharged.\n- Test particle: A small insulating sphere of charge +q and mass m moves between the shells. Collisions with both shells are perfectly elastic (specular: v_r reverses, v_t unchanged), and charges remain fixed.\n- Field and potential: In the region R < r < 2R, the electric field is radial and equals that of a point charge Q at the center: E(r) = k Q/r^2 (outward). The electrostatic potential energy for the test charge is U(r) = k q Q/r.\n- Goal: The particle is launched from point A on the inner shell (r = R) with adjustable direction. It is known that the particle can return to A after sweeping exactly one full revolution (2π) around the center. If it hits the inner shell a total of n times (counting the final return as one hit), find the minimum launch speed v (neglect gravity).\n\n2) Approach\n- Between collisions, motion is under a central repulsive inverse-square potential U(r) = κ/r with κ = k q Q > 0.\n- Conserved quantities between collisions: total energy E and angular momentum L. At specular collisions with spherical shells, only the radial component of velocity reverses; v_t (and therefore L) is unchanged, and total energy is conserved.\n- The angular advance from r = R to r = 2R is computable from\n  dφ = L/(m r^2 v_r) dr, where v_r is determined from energy conservation.\n- One “cycle” R → 2R → R advances the polar angle by Δφ_cycle = 2 Δφ_up. If the inner shell is hit n times (one hit per cycle), the total angle is n Δφ_cycle, and for a full revolution around the center we require n Δφ_cycle = 2π.\n- Minimization: For a given launch speed v at r = R, the angular momentum is maximized by a tangential launch (v_r = 0 at launch). Since the angular advance per cycle increases monotonically with L for fixed energy, the minimum speed required for a given n is achieved by a tangential launch.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep 1: Energy and angular momentum for a tangential launch\n- Define κ = k q Q (> 0).\n- Launch at r = R, tangentially: v_r(R) = 0, v_t(R) = v.\n- Energy: E = (1/2) m v^2 + U(R) = (1/2) m v^2 + κ/R.\n- Angular momentum: L = m R v.\n\nBetween collisions, at radius r, energy conservation gives\n(1/2) m v_r^2 + (1/2) m (v_t)^2 + U(r) = E,\nwith v_t(r) = L/(m r) = (R v)/r.\n\nHence,\nv_r^2 = (2/m) [E − U(r)] − (L^2)/(m^2 r^2)\n= v^2 + (2 κ/m)(1/R − 1/r) − (R^2 v^2)/r^2.\n\nIntroduce the dimensionless variable u = R/r (so u ∈ [1/2, 1] when r ∈ [2R, R]) and the dimensionless parameter\ns = (m R v^2)/κ > 0  ⇒  κ/(m R) = v^2/s.\n\nThen\nv_r^2 = v^2 [1 − u^2] + (2 κ/(m R)) [1 − u]\n= v^2 [1 − u^2 + (2/s)(1 − u)].\n\nStep 2: Angular advance from R to 2R\nThe angular element is\ndφ = L/(m r^2 v_r) dr = (R v)/(r^2 v_r) dr.\n\nUsing r = R/u and dr = −R du/u^2 gives the standard simplification\ndφ = − v/v_r du.\n\nTherefore the angular advance on the outward leg (R → 2R) is\nΔφ_up = ∫_{r=R}^{2R} L/(m r^2 v_r) dr = ∫_{u=1}^{1/2} (− v/v_r) du\n= ∫_{u=1/2}^{1} du / sqrt[1 − u^2 + (2/s)(1 − u)].\n\nComplete the square in the denominator:\n1 − u^2 + (2/s)(1 − u) = (1 + 2/s) − (2/s) u − u^2\n= (1 + 1/s)^2 − (u + 1/s)^2.\n\nHence\nΔφ_up = ∫_{1/2}^{1} du / sqrt[(1 + 1/s)^2 − (u + 1/s)^2]\n= arcsin[(u + 1/s)/(1 + 1/s)] |_{u=1/2}^{u=1}\n= π/2 − arcsin[ (1/2 + 1/s) / (1 + 1/s) ].\n\nA bit of algebra yields\n(1/2 + 1/s)/(1 + 1/s) = (s + 2)/(2(s + 1)).\n\nTherefore\nΔφ_up = π/2 − arcsin[ (s + 2)/(2(s + 1)) ].\n\nBy symmetry (same E and L, radial velocity reversed), the inward leg contributes the same angular advance, so the full “cycle” R → 2R → R is\nΔφ_cycle(s) = 2 Δφ_up = π − 2 arcsin[ (s + 2)/(2(s + 1)) ]\n= 2 arccos[ (s + 2)/(2(s + 1)) ].\n\nStep 3: Commensurability condition and solving for s\nIf the particle hits the inner shell n times (one hit per full cycle) before returning to A after one full revolution, the total azimuthal angle must satisfy\nn Δφ_cycle = 2π\n⇒ 2 n arccos[ (s + 2)/(2(s + 1)) ] = 2π\n⇒ arccos[ (s + 2)/(2(s + 1)) ] = π/n.\n\nThus\n(s + 2)/(2(s + 1)) = cos(π/n) ≡ c.\nSolve for s:\ns + 2 = 2c (s + 1) = 2 c s + 2 c\n⇒ s (1 − 2 c) = 2(c − 1)\n⇒ s = 2(1 − c)/(2 c − 1) = 2[1 − cos(π/n)]/[2 cos(π/n) − 1].\n\nBecause s > 0, we need 2 cos(π/n) − 1 > 0 ⇒ cos(π/n) > 1/2 ⇒ π/n < π/3 ⇒ n > 3. Hence:\n- For n ≥ 4, a finite minimum speed exists.\n- For n = 3, the denominator tends to 0+, s → ∞ (requires v → ∞).\n- For n ≤ 2, s would be nonpositive (impossible).\n\nStep 4: Minimum launch speed\nRecall s = m R v^2/κ. Therefore\nv_min^2 = (κ/(m R)) s = (k q Q)/(m R) × 2[1 − cos(π/n)]/[2 cos(π/n) − 1].\n\nThus, for n ≥ 4,\nv_min(n) = sqrt{ (k q Q)/(m R) × 2[1 − cos(π/n)]/[2 cos(π/n) − 1] }.\n\nConsistency checks:\n- n → ∞: cos(π/n) ≈ 1 − (π^2/2 n^2) ⇒ s ≈ (π/n)^2 ⇒ v_min ≈ sqrt(κ/(m R)) (π/n) → 0, as expected since many small angular steps can add to 2π with tiny speed.\n- n = 4: cos(π/4) = √2/2 ⇒ s = 2(1 − √2/2)/(√2 − 1) = √2 ⇒ v_min = (κ/(m R))^{1/2} 2^{1/4}.\n\nWhy tangential launch minimizes v:\nFor fixed E, the integrand L/[m r^2 sqrt(2/m (E − U) − L^2/(m^2 r^2))] increases monotonically with L in the allowed range, so Δφ_cycle increases with L. At r = R and fixed speed v, L is maximized by a tangential launch (L = m R v). Therefore the minimal v achieving the required angular advance (2π/n per cycle) occurs for a tangential launch.\n\n4) Final Answer\n- Define κ = k q Q, with k = 1/(4π ε0).\n- For an integer n ≥ 4 (number of impacts with the inner shell including the final return) the minimum launch speed (tangential at r = R) that yields a return to the starting point after one full revolution is\n\n[ \\boxed{ v_{\\min}(n) = \\sqrt{ \\frac{k\\,q\\,Q}{m\\,R} \\cdot \\frac{2\\,[\\,1 - \\cos(\\pi/n)\\,]}{\\,2\\cos(\\pi/n) - 1\\,} } \\quad (n \\ge 4) } ]\n\n- No finite solution exists for n ≤ 3 (n = 3 requires v → ∞; n ≤ 2 is impossible)."}

The ring starts just inside a sector of a uniform magnetic field B (perpendicular to the ring), whose sector center is at the suspension point and whose radial edges are just tangent to the ring when the string is vertical. The ring is given an initial horizontal speed v0 at the bottom (string vertical). As the ring swings away, it exits the magnetic sector over a very small angular range (of order r/α), and a current is induced in the superconducting ring so that its total flux is conserved. This induces a magnetic torque opposing exit (Lenz’s law), causing mechanical energy to be converted into magnetic energy stored in the ring’s inductance L. Outside the field, the pendulum must still climb under gravity to reach the horizontal (π/2) position.\n\nWe are asked: What is the minimum initial speed v0,min so that the string can reach the horizontal?\n\n2) Approach\n- Use flux conservation for a superconducting loop (fluxoid conservation, neglecting quantization effects): Φtot = Φext + L I = constant.\n- Initially, the ring is fully inside the uniform B field, so Φext(0) = B A with A = πr^2, and I(0) = 0. Hence Φtot = B A.\n- As the ring moves out of the sector, Φext decreases from B A to 0, and a current I is induced such that Φext + L I = B A. When the ring is fully outside, Φext = 0, so I* = B A / L, and magnetic energy Umag = (1/2) L I*^2 = (B^2 A^2)/(2L).\n- Energy accounting in two stages:\n  Stage A (while inside the field): part of the initial kinetic energy is converted into magnetic energy Umag. The gravitational potential change over the small exit angle is negligible (r ≪ α; also given that magnetic torque dominates gravity inside the field).\n  Stage B (outside the field): no further magnetic work; the remaining kinetic energy must supply the gravitational potential rise m g α to reach the horizontal.\n- Impose threshold equality for the minimum initial speed.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep 1: Flux conservation and induced current\n- Superconducting ring implies conservation of total linked flux:\n  Φtot = Φext + L I = constant.\n- Initially (string vertical; ring just inside field sector):\n  Φext(0) = B A, with A = π r^2, and I(0) = 0,\n  so Φtot = B A.\n- After the ring completely exits the field sector (still near the bottom because the sector is narrow), Φext → 0. Then:\n  0 + L I* = B A  ⇒  I* = B A / L.\n- Magnetic energy stored in the ring’s inductance at that point:\n  Umag = (1/2) L I*^2 = (1/2) L (B A / L)^2 = (B^2 A^2)/(2 L).\n\nStep 2: Geometry and small-angle exit\n- The sector edges are tangent to the ring when vertical. As the pendulum deflects by a small angle φ, the ring progressively exits the field.\n- The total angular span over which the overlap decreases from full area A to zero is of order φ* ~ 2 r / α (because a lateral displacement of order the ring diameter 2r is needed along the circular path of radius α).\n- This angle is very small since r ≪ α. Hence the gravitational potential change while exiting is small:\n  ΔUg,exit = m g α (1 − cos φ*) ≈ m g α (φ*^2 / 2) ≈ m g α [(2r/α)^2 / 2] = 2 m g r^2 / α,\n  which is negligible compared with m g α (and, by the stated “strong field” condition, also negligible compared with the magnetic torque effects inside the field). We will therefore neglect ΔUg,exit in the main result.\n\nStep 3: Energy balance — Stage A (inside field sector)\n- Take the vertical position as zero gravitational potential reference.\n- Initial mechanical energy:\n  E0 = K0 = (1/2) m v0^2.\n- Just after the ring has fully left the field sector (still near the bottom):\n  - Magnetic energy stored: Umag = (B^2 A^2)/(2 L).\n  - Gravitational potential increase: ΔUg,exit ≈ 0 (negligible).\n  - Remaining kinetic energy: Kout.\n- Energy conservation (neglecting ΔUg,exit):\n  (1/2) m v0^2 = Umag + Kout.\n\nStep 4: Energy balance — Stage B (outside field sector)\n- After exiting the field, there is no further magnetic interaction. To reach the horizontal (π/2), the pendulum’s center of mass must rise by height α, so the required gravitational potential increase is:\n  ΔUg,up = m g α.\n- For the pendulum to just reach horizontal, the remaining kinetic energy Kout must exactly supply this rise:\n  Kout = m g α.\n- Substitute this into the Stage A balance:\n  (1/2) m v0^2 = Umag + m g α.\n\nStep 5: Solve for v0,min and express in given parameters\n- Using A = π r^2, we have:\n  Umag = (B^2 A^2)/(2 L) = (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(2 L).\n- Therefore,\n  (1/2) m v0,min^2 = (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(2 L) + m g α.\n- Multiply by 2/m:\n  v0,min^2 = (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(L m) + 2 g α.\n  v0,min = sqrt[(B^2 π^2 r^4)/(L m) + 2 g α].\n\nConsistency checks:\n- If B → 0 or L → ∞ (no induced current), v0,min → sqrt(2 g α), the usual result for a simple pendulum to reach horizontal.\n- For strong magnetic coupling (large B, small L), the magnetic term dominates, meaning extra initial speed is needed to supply the magnetic energy stored in the superconducting loop.\n\nRemark on small correction:\n- Including the tiny gravitational increase during exit adds ≈ 2 g r^2/α inside the square root (after suitable scaling), but since r ≪ α and magnetic torque dominates inside the field, this correction is negligible for the stated conditions.\n\n4) Final Answer\nThe minimum initial speed required is the quadrature sum of the usual gravitational requirement and the additional requirement to supply the magnetic energy stored in the superconducting ring’s inductance:\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ v_{0,\\min} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\;\\dfrac{B^{2}\\,\\pi^{2}\\,r^{4}}{L\\,m}\\;+\\;2\\,g\\,\\alpha\\;} } \\]"}

This forces the time-dependent terms to match, yielding the required relation between aB and aA, L0, c.\n- As a cross-check, note that D(t) will be constant if and only if A’s right end and B’s left end have identical velocity histories v(t) in S; that occurs when they share the same “Rindler radius,” leading to the same result.\n\nSection 3: Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Constant proper-acceleration worldline (Rindler motion)\n- A point with constant proper acceleration α that is at rest at t = 0 and x = 0 has parametric motion\n  t(τ) = (c/α) sinh(ατ/c),  x(τ) = (c^2/α)(cosh(ατ/c) − 1),\n  which eliminates to\n  x(t) = − c^2/α + sqrt[(ct)^2 + (c^2/α)^2].\n- If at t = 0 the point is instead located at x = x0 (still with v = 0), the worldline is simply shifted:\n  x(t) = x0 − c^2/α + sqrt[(ct)^2 + (c^2/α)^2].\n\nStep 2: Born-rigid rod accelerated from its left end\n- For a Born-rigid rod whose left end has constant proper acceleration aL, a material point a proper distance ξ to the right follows the hyperbola characterized by the Rindler parameter\n  ρ(ξ) = c^2/aL + ξ.\n- Its S-frame worldline (with the left end at x = 0 at t = 0) is\n  x(ξ, t) = − c^2/aL + sqrt[(ct)^2 + (c^2/aL + ξ)^2].\n- Checks:\n  - At t = 0, x(ξ, 0) = − c^2/aL + (c^2/aL + ξ) = ξ, as required (the rod is at rest with length L0).\n  - The proper acceleration of the point ξ is α(ξ) = c^2/ρ(ξ) = aL / (1 + aL ξ / c^2), constant in time.\n\nStep 3: Worldlines of the two critical points\n- A’s right end (ξ = L0 on train A, left end acceleration aA, left end initially at x = 0):\n  xA,right(t) = − c^2/aA + sqrt[(ct)^2 + (c^2/aA + L0)^2].\n- B’s left end (ξ = 0 on train B, left end acceleration aB, initially at x = L0 + D):\n  xB,left(t) = (L0 + D) − c^2/aB + sqrt[(ct)^2 + (c^2/aB)^2].\n\nStep 4: Enforce D(t) ≡ D\n- The instantaneous gap in S is\n  D(t) = xB,left(t) − xA,right(t)\n       = (L0 + D) − c^2/aB + sqrt[(ct)^2 + (c^2/aB)^2]\n         − [ − c^2/aA + sqrt[(ct)^2 + (c^2/aA + L0)^2] ].\n- Simplify:\n  D(t) = D + L0 − c^2/aB + c^2/aA\n         + [ sqrt[(ct)^2 + (c^2/aB)^2] − sqrt[(ct)^2 + (c^2/aA + L0)^2] ].\n- For D(t) to be independent of t, the difference of the two square roots must be a constant. The only way this holds for all t is for their arguments to be equal:\n  (c^2/aB)^2 = (c^2/aA + L0)^2.\n- Since all quantities are positive, take the positive root:\n  c^2/aB = c^2/aA + L0.\n- Solve for aB:\n  aB = aA / (1 + aA L0 / c^2).\n\nStep 5: Consistency checks\n- Monotonicity: 1 + aA L0 / c^2 > 1 implies aB < aA. The left end of B must accelerate less than the left end of A to keep the lab-frame gap fixed, which is physically sensible because A’s right end experiences a reduced proper acceleration compared to A’s left end under Born rigidity.\n- Newtonian limit: If aA L0 / c^2 ≪ 1, then aB ≈ aA(1 − aA L0 / c^2) ≈ aA, so the difference is a relativistic correction.\n- Direct substitution: With c^2/aB = c^2/aA + L0, the square-root terms cancel and D(t) reduces exactly to D.\n\nSection 4: Final Answer\n- The required proper acceleration of the left end of train B is\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,a_{B} \\;=\\; \\frac{a_{A}}{1+\\dfrac{a_{A}\\,L_{0}}{c^{2}}}\\,} \\]"}

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/412", "questions": "Consider a semi-infinite solenoid with radius $R$, turns per unit length $n$, connected to a constant current source with current $I$. To facilitate subsequent calculations, we establish a cylindrical coordinate system such that the $z$-axis coincides with the symmetry axis of the solenoid. The solenoid extends from the origin along the negative $z$-axis to infinity, and the current is viewed as rotating counterclockwise when observed from above the $z$-axis, meaning the direction of the current is in the positive $\\hat{\\theta}$ direction. Now, a superconducting metal ring is placed such that some constraint keeps the symmetry axis of the current loop always coinciding with the $z$-axis, allowing it to move freely up and down in this state. It is known that at the instant the metal ring transitions from normal to superconducting state, a current $I_{0}$ flows within the ring, and there is no other external magnetic field at a sufficiently far distance from the solenoid. $I_{0}$ flows in the positive $\\hat{\\theta}$ direction. Subsequently, the metal ring remains in the superconducting state. Assume the gravitational acceleration is $\\overrightarrow{g}=-g\\widehat{z}$, the mass of the metal ring is $m$, and it is of uniform density. Let $z_{0}>0$ be known. If the equilibrium is stable, find the vibration period $T$ near the equilibrium position (expressed in terms of $n$, $I_{0}$, $r$, $R$, $L$, $m$), and the answer may include $z_{0}$.

The solenoid carries a constant current I and has n turns per unit length. Above the mouth (z > 0), the on-axis magnetic field points along +z.\n- Object: A thin superconducting ring (radius r ≪ R, self-inductance L, mass m) is constrained to move along the z-axis, always coaxial with the solenoid.\n- Initial condition: At the instant the ring becomes superconducting while located at z = z0 (> 0), the ring current is I0 (flowing in +θ). Thereafter, the fluxoid through the ring is conserved.\n- Goal: If a stable equilibrium exists, find the small-oscillation period T about the equilibrium position. The result should be expressed in terms of n, I0, r, R, L, m (and may include z0). Physical constants like μ0 are understood.\n\n2) Approach\n- Compute the on-axis magnetic field B(z) of a semi-infinite solenoid for z > 0.\n- For r ≪ R, the field is uniform over the ring; the external flux through the ring is Φext(z) = π r^2 B(z).\n- Use superconducting flux conservation: L I(z) + Φext(z) = L I0 + Φext(z0) to obtain I(z).\n- Use energy methods. The effective potential is U(z) = mg z + [C − Φext(z)]^2/(2L), with C = L I0 + Φext(z0). Then the small-oscillation period follows from T = 2π sqrt(m/U″(zeq)), where zeq solves U′(zeq) = 0. Gravity determines the equilibrium position but does not enter U″, hence does not enter T.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep A. On-axis field of the semi-infinite solenoid (z > 0)\nA standard result (obtainable by integrating the field of turns from −∞ to 0) is\nB(z) = (μ0 n I / 2) [ 1 − z / √(R^2 + z^2) ],  z > 0.\nDerivatives with respect to z are\nB′(z) = − (μ0 n I / 2) R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^{3/2},\nB″(z) = + (3 μ0 n I / 2) z R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^{5/2}.\nNote B′(z) < 0 and B″(z) > 0 for z > 0.\n\nStep B. External flux and its derivatives\nWith r ≪ R, the external flux through the ring is\nΦext(z) = π r^2 B(z).\nHence\nΦ′(z) = π r^2 B′(z) = − π r^2 (μ0 n I / 2) R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^{3/2},\nΦ″(z) = π r^2 B″(z) = + 3 π r^2 (μ0 n I / 2) z R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^{5/2}.\n\nStep C. Flux conservation and ring current I(z)\nAt the superconducting transition (at z0) the total fluxoid freezes:\nC = L I0 + Φext(z0).\nThereafter, for any z,\nL I(z) + Φext(z) = C  ⇒  I(z) = [C − Φext(z)]/L\n= I0 + [Φext(z0) − Φext(z)]/L\n= I0 + [π r^2 (B(z0) − B(z))]/L.\n\nStep D. Force, equilibrium, and stability\n- Effective potential energy:\nU(z) = mg z + [C − Φext(z)]^2/(2L).\n- Its derivatives:\nU′(z) = mg − [(C − Φext) Φ′]/L = mg − I(z) Φ′(z),\nU″(z) = [(Φ′)^2 − (C − Φext) Φ″]/L = (Φ′)^2/L − I(z) Φ″(z).\n- Equilibrium position zeq satisfies U′(zeq) = 0 ⇒ mg = I(zeq) Φ′(zeq).\nSince Φ′(zeq) < 0 for z > 0, a stable levitated equilibrium above the mouth typically has I(zeq) < 0 (opposite to the solenoid’s loop sense), giving an upward magnetic force to balance weight.\n- Stability requires U″(zeq) > 0, which is automatically favored when I(zeq) < 0 because Φ″(zeq) > 0.\n\nStep E. Small-oscillation period\nThe small-oscillation frequency is ω = √[U″(zeq)/m], hence\nT = 2π √[ m / U″(zeq) ] with\nU″(zeq) = (Φ′(zeq))^2/L − I(zeq) Φ″(zeq).\nSubstituting the explicit derivatives from Step B and the current from Step C gives a fully explicit expression.\n\nA compact and physically transparent form is\nT = 2π √{ m / [ (π r^2)^2 (B′(zeq))^2 / L − (π r^2) B″(zeq) I(zeq) ] },\nwith\nB′(z) = − (μ0 n I / 2) R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^{3/2},\nB″(z) = + (3 μ0 n I / 2) z R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^{5/2},\nI(z) = I0 + [π r^2 (B(z0) − B(z))]/L,\nB(z) = (μ0 n I / 2) [ 1 − z / √(R^2 + z^2) ].\nHere zeq is determined (if needed) by the equilibrium condition mg = I(zeq) π r^2 B′(zeq). Note that g does not appear in U″ and thus not in T; it only fixes zeq.\n\nOptional: explicit “near-z0” approximation\nIf the equilibrium lies close to the quench position, zeq ≈ z0, one may evaluate the curvature at z0 and use I(z0) = I0:\nU″(z0) = (Φ′(z0))^2/L − I0 Φ″(z0)\n= [ (π r^2)^2 (B′(z0))^2 ]/L − (π r^2) I0 B″(z0),\nso that\nT ≈ 2π √{ m / [ (π r^2)^2 (B′(z0))^2 / L − (π r^2) I0 B″(z0) ] }.\nInserting B′(z0), B″(z0) from above yields a fully explicit approximation in terms of n, I, I0, r, R, L, m, z0.\n\n4) Final expression in closed form\nFor convenience, define K ≡ π r^2 (μ0 n I / 2) and f(z) ≡ 1 − z/√(R^2 + z^2). Then\nΦext(z) = K f(z),  Φ′(z) = − K R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^{3/2},  Φ″(z) = 3 K z R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^{5/2},\nI(z) = I0 + [K/L] [ f(z0) − f(z) ].\nTherefore\nU″(z) = [ K^2 R^4 / (R^2 + z^2)^3 − ( L I0 + K ( f(z0) − f(z) ) ) ( 3 K z R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^{5/2} ) ] / L,\nand\nT = 2π √{ m / U″(zeq) }, with zeq solving mg = I(zeq) Φ′(zeq).\n\nThese formulas are explicit in n, I0, r, R, L, m (and z0), and contain μ0 and the solenoid current I through K and f.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{%\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{With } B(z)=\\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{R^2+z^2}}\\right),\\ \\ \nB'(z)=-\\frac{\\mu_0 n I}{2}\\,\\frac{R^2}{(R^2+z^2)^{3/2}},\\ \\ \nB''(z)=\\frac{3\\mu_0 n I}{2}\\,\\frac{zR^2}{(R^2+z^2)^{5/2}},\\\\[4pt]\n&\\Phi_{\\rm ext}(z)=\\pi r^2 B(z),\\quad I(z)=I_0+\\frac{\\pi r^2}{L}\\big[B(z_0)-B(z)\\big],\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{the small–oscillation period about the stable equilibrium }z_{\\rm eq}>0\\text{ is}\\\\[4pt]\n&T=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{U''(z_{\\rm eq})}},\\quad \nU''(z)=\\frac{(\\Phi'_{\\rm ext})^2}{L}-I(z)\\,\\Phi''_{\\rm ext}(z)\n=\\frac{(\\pi r^2)^2\\,[B'(z)]^2}{L}-\\pi r^2\\,B''(z)\\,I(z),\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{with }z_{\\rm eq}\\text{ determined by }mg=I(z_{\\rm eq})\\,\\pi r^2 B'(z_{\\rm eq}).\\\\[6pt]\n&\\text{Optional near-quench explicit approximation (if }z_{\\rm eq}\\approx z_0\\text{): }\\\\[2pt]\n&T\\approx 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\dfrac{(\\pi r^2)^2\\,[B'(z_0)]^2}{L}-\\pi r^2\\,B''(z_0)\\,I_0}}\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n} \\]"}

Hence I(t) = 0 for t > 0, as expected.\n- The decay constant τ = (h1 ε2 + h2 ε1)/(h1 σ2 + h2 σ1) captures how the two leaky dielectrics in series behave as a single first-order element.\n\n4) Final Answer\nFor t > 0 (excluding any Dirac impulse at t = 0 from the ideal step source), the current through the switch is a single-exponential relaxation to a DC value:\n- Time constant:\nτ = (h1 ε2 + h2 ε1)/(h1 σ2 + h2 σ1).\n- Initial and steady currents:\nI(0+) = U0 A [σ1 h1 ε2^2 + σ2 h2 ε1^2]/(h1 ε2 + h2 ε1)^2,\nIdc = U0 A σ1 σ2/(σ1 h2 + σ2 h1) = U0 A/(h1/σ1 + h2/σ2).\n\nThus\nI(t) = Idc + [I(0+) − Idc] e^(−t/τ),  t > 0.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&I(t) \\;=\\; I_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\;+\\; \\big[I(0^+) - I_{\\mathrm{dc}}\\big]\\, e^{-t/\\tau}, \\quad t>0,\\\\[4pt]\n&\\tau \\;=\\; \\frac{h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1}{\\,h_1 \\sigma_2 + h_2 \\sigma_1\\,},\\\\[4pt]\n&I(0^+) \\;=\\; U_0 A\\, \\frac{\\sigma_1 h_1 \\varepsilon_2^{\\,2} + \\sigma_2 h_2 \\varepsilon_1^{\\,2}}{\\big(h_1 \\varepsilon_2 + h_2 \\varepsilon_1\\big)^2},\\\\[4pt]\n&I_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\;=\\; U_0 A\\, \\frac{\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1 h_2 + \\sigma_2 h_1} \\;=\\; \\frac{U_0 A}{\\,h_1/\\sigma_1 + h_2/\\sigma_2\\,}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}

The snow is initially at rest relative to the ground; as the cube advances, it sweeps up (sticks) snow with mass rate proportional to the swept surface area. The mass of the cube therefore increases.\n- Small parameters: σ r R ≪ M (so added mass is small) and r ≪ R (retain terms only up to first order in r).\n- Asked: how high the cube climbs on the opposite side, i.e., the turning point near θ ≈ 2π. We must obtain y(θf) to first order in r (and in σ r R/M).\n\n2) Approach\n\n- Use the tangential equation of motion for a body that accretes mass at rest (rocket-type equation along the tangent). For snow at rest in the lab frame, the tangential equation is:\n  m dv/dt = m g sin α − v dm/dt,\n  where α is the tangent angle to the horizontal and v is the speed along the curve.\n- Convert to cycloid parameter θ using ds/dθ and sin α for the cycloid. Since dm/ds = σ r (swept snow mass per unit arc length), we obtain a first-order linear ODE for V(θ) = v^2(θ).\n- Solve the ODE perturbatively to first order in the small parameter A = 4 σ r R/M (i.e., keep m ≈ M in the drag-like term).\n- Determine the turning point θf by setting v(θf) = 0.

Show that the finite-size COM-offset corrections contribute only at higher order than retained and can be neglected in the final height to first order in r.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Cycloid geometry and useful relations\n\nFor the cycloid\n- x = R(θ − sin θ), y = R(1 − cos θ),\n  with θ increasing from 0 at the left cusp (y = 0) to 2π at the right cusp (y = 0).\n- Arc length element: ds/dθ = √[(dx/dθ)^2 + (dy/dθ)^2] = 2R sin(θ/2).\n- Slope angle α relative to the horizontal: sin α = dy/ds = [R sin θ]/[2R sin(θ/2)] = cos(θ/2).\n\nThe total arc length from θ = 0 to θ = 2π is s(2π) = ∫0^{2π} 2R sin(θ/2) dθ = 8R.\n\nStep 2: Mass accretion\n\n- The cube of width r (into the page) sweeps snow of surface density σ, hence the accreted mass per arc length is:\n  dm = σ r ds  ⇒  dm/ds = σ r (constant).\n- The mass as a function of θ (starting from M at θ = 0) is:\n  m(θ) = M + ∫_0^θ (dm/ds)(ds/dϕ) dϕ = M + σ r ∫_0^θ 2R sin(ϕ/2) dϕ\n        = M + 4 σ r R [1 − cos(θ/2)].\n- Since σ r R ≪ M, we will use m ≈ M inside denominators, retaining only first-order effects in σ r.\n\nStep 3: Tangential variable-mass dynamics and ODE for v^2(θ)\n\nThe tangential dynamics with accretion of quiescent mass is:\n- m dv/dt = m g sin α − v dm/dt.\n\nRewrite in terms of s and θ:\n- Using v = ds/dt, we get m v dv/ds = m g sin α − v^2 dm/ds.\n- Let V(θ) ≡ v^2(θ). Then dV/ds = 2 v dv/ds, so\n  (m/2) dV/ds = m g sin α − V dm/ds.\n\nConvert derivatives with ds/dθ = 2R sin(θ/2) and dm/ds = σ r:\n- dV/dθ = 2 g sin α (ds/dθ) − 2 V (dm/ds)/m (ds/dθ)\n        = 4 g R sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) − 4 σ r R sin(θ/2) V/m(θ).\n\nTo first order, set m(θ) ≈ M in the V-coefficient.

If one used energy at fixed mass, v0^2 would acquire an O(r) shift. Multiplying that O(r) change by A ∼ O(σ r) would produce O(r^2) terms, beyond the first order retained. Hence using V0 = 4 g R sin^2(θ/2) in the loss term is consistent to first order in r.\n\nStep 5: Locate the turning point θf = 2π − δ (δ ≪ 1)\n\nAt the turning point, V(θf) = 0. Let θ = 2π − δ. Then:\n- θ/2 = π − δ/2,\n- cos(θ/2) = cos(π − δ/2) = −cos(δ/2) ≈ −(1 − δ^2/8) = −1 + δ^2/8,\n- sin^2(θ/2) = sin^2(π − δ/2) = sin^2(δ/2) ≈ δ^2/4.\n\nEvaluate the three pieces in V(θ):\n\n1) V0(θ) = 4 g R sin^2(θ/2) ≈ 4 g R (δ^2/4) = g R δ^2.\n\n2) 2A cos(θ/2) V0(θ) ≈ 2A (−1 + δ^2/8) (g R δ^2) ≈ −2A g R δ^2  (the δ^4 term is higher order and neglected).\n\n3) −(16/3) A g R [1 − cos^3(θ/2)].\n   With cos(θ/2) ≈ −1 + δ^2/8, we have cos^3(θ/2) ≈ −1 + 3(δ^2/8), hence\n   1 − cos^3(θ/2) ≈ 2 − 3δ^2/8.\n   Thus −(16/3) A g R [1 − cos^3] ≈ −(32/3) A g R + 2A g R δ^2.\n\nSumming:\n- V(θf) ≈ g R δ^2 − 2A g R δ^2 − (32/3) A g R + 2A g R δ^2\n         ≈ g R δ^2 − (32/3) A g R.\n\nSet V(θf) = 0 ⇒ g R δ^2 = (32/3) A g R ⇒\n- δ^2 = (32/3) A = (32/3) (4 σ r R / M) = (128/3) (σ r R / M).\n\nStep 6: Highest position on the other side\n\nThe cycloid’s downward coordinate y at θf is:\n- y(θf) = R [1 − cos θf] = R [1 − cos(2π − δ)] = R [1 − cos δ] ≈ R (δ^2/2).\n\nTherefore, to first order:\n- y_max = y(θf) ≈ R (1/2) δ^2 = (R/2) (128/3) (σ r R / M) = (64/3) (σ r R^2 / M).\n\nInterpretation: y_max is the shortfall below the cusp (top) on the far side, i.e., the cube reaches a height whose vertical gap to the top is y_max. The finite-size COM-offset contributes only at higher order (∼ r δ ∼ r √(σ r R/M)), so it does not affect the first-order result shown.\n\n4) Final Answer\n\n- Turning-point angle: θf = 2π − δ with δ^2 = (128/3) (σ r R / M).\n- Vertical shortfall below the top (highest position on the far side):\n  y_max = (64/3) (σ r R^2 / M) + higher-order corrections.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,y_{\\text{max}} \\;\\simeq\\; \\frac{64}{3}\\,\\frac{\\sigma\\, r\\, R^{2}}{M}\\,}\n\\]"}

The goal is to express the sound speed in terms of the macroscopic thermodynamic variables p (pressure), ρ (mass density), and the van der Waals parameters a and b, along with the molar mass μ and the adiabatic index γ = (c_v + R)/c_v.\n\nFor small-amplitude, long-wavelength perturbations in a compressible fluid with negligible heat exchange (adiabatic), the sound speed is given by:\n- c^2 = (∂p/∂ρ)_S, i.e., the adiabatic derivative of pressure with respect to density.\n\nHere the equation of state is the van der Waals equation for one mole:\n- (p + a/V^2)(V − b) = RT,\nwhere V is the molar volume.\n\n### Approach\n1. Use the thermodynamic identities provided to derive the adiabatic (isentropic) relation for a van der Waals gas.\n2. From the adiabatic relation, compute (∂p/∂V)_S.\n3. Convert this to (∂p/∂ρ)_S using V = μ/ρ, and then obtain c^2 = (∂p/∂ρ)_S.\n4. Simplify the result to the requested variables p, ρ, a, b, μ, and γ.\n5. Verify the ideal-gas limit a → 0, b → 0 reduces to c^2 = γ p/ρ.\n\n### Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Sound speed for small adiabatic perturbations\n- For small, adiabatic perturbations, the speed of sound is:\n  c^2 = (∂p/∂ρ)_S.\n\nTo evaluate this for a non-ideal gas, it is convenient to first find the adiabatic relation p(V) along an isentrope, then differentiate appropriately.\n\nStep 2: Adiabatic relation for a van der Waals gas\n- Start from the given thermodynamic identities (per mole):\n  dU = c_v dT + (∂U/∂V)_T dV,\n  (∂U/∂V)_T = T (∂p/∂T)_V − p.\n\n- For the van der Waals equation:\n  p(V, T) = RT/(V − b) − a/V^2,\n  hence (∂p/∂T)_V = R/(V − b).\n\n- Therefore:\n  (∂U/∂V)_T = T [R/(V − b)] − p = [RT/(V − b)] − [RT/(V − b) − a/V^2] = a/V^2.\n\n- For an adiabatic (reversible, no heat exchange) process, the first law gives:\n  dQ = 0 ⇒ dU + p dV = 0.\n\n- Substitute dU and (∂U/∂V)_T:\n  c_v dT + (a/V^2) dV + p dV = 0\n  ⇒ c_v dT + [p + a/V^2] dV = 0.\n\n- Use the equation of state to simplify the bracket:\n  p + a/V^2 = RT/(V − b).\n\n- Then:\n  c_v dT + [RT/(V − b)] dV = 0\n  ⇒ (c_v/T) dT + R dV/(V − b) = 0.\n\n- Integrate:\n  c_v ln T + R ln(V − b) = const\n  ⇒ ln T + (R/c_v) ln(V − b) = const\n  ⇒ T (V − b)^{R/c_v} = const.\n\n- Introduce γ = (c_v + R)/c_v = 1 + R/c_v, so 1 + R/c_v = γ. Multiply both sides by (V − b):\n  T (V − b)^{γ−1} (V − b) = T (V − b)^γ−?? Better substitute T using the equation of state instead:\n  Using p + a/V^2 = RT/(V − b) ⇒ T = (V − b)(p + a/V^2)/R.\n\n- Substitute T into the integrated adiabatic relation:\n  [(V − b)(p + a/V^2)/R] (V − b)^{R/c_v} = const\n  ⇒ (p + a/V^2) (V − b)^{1 + R/c_v} = const'\n  ⇒ (p + a/V^2) (V − b)^γ = const (adiabatic relation).\n\nThus, the isentropic (adiabatic) relation for a van der Waals gas is:\n- (p + a/V^2)(V − b)^γ = const.\n\nStep 3: Compute (∂p/∂V)_S from the adiabat\n- Differentiate the adiabatic invariant with respect to V at constant entropy S:\n  Let y = p + a/V^2, so the invariant is y (V − b)^γ = const.\n\n- Taking differential:\n  d[y (V − b)^γ] = 0\n  ⇒ (V − b)^γ dy + y γ (V − b)^{γ−1} dV = 0\n  ⇒ dy = − y γ dV/(V − b).\n\n- But dy = dp + d(a/V^2) = dp − 2a dV/V^3.\n\n- Therefore:\n  dp − 2a dV/V^3 = − y γ dV/(V − b),\n  where y = p + a/V^2.\n\n- Solve for (∂p/∂V)_S:\n  (∂p/∂V)_S = 2a/V^3 − γ (p + a/V^2)/(V − b).\n\nStep 4: Convert to (∂p/∂ρ)_S\n- The mass density ρ is related to the molar volume V by:\n  V = μ/ρ, where μ is the molar mass.\n\n- Then:\n  dV/dρ = − μ/ρ^2 = − V^2/μ.\n\n- Hence:\n  c^2 = (∂p/∂ρ)_S = (∂p/∂V)_S (dV/dρ) = − (V^2/μ) (∂p/∂V)_S.\n\n- Substitute (∂p/∂V)_S:\n  c^2 = − (V^2/μ) [ 2a/V^3 − γ (p + a/V^2)/(V − b) ]\n      = − 2a/(μ V) + (V^2/μ) γ (p + a/V^2)/(V − b).\n\n- Replace V = μ/ρ and simplify:\n  First term: − 2a/(μ V) = − 2a/(μ ⋅ μ/ρ) = − 2a ρ/μ^2.\n\n  Second term:\n  (V^2/μ) γ (p + a/V^2)/(V − b)\n  = (γ/μ) [ V^2 p + a ]/(V − b)\n  = (γ/μ) [ (μ^2/ρ^2) p + a ] / (μ/ρ − b)\n  = γ [ p μ^2/ρ + a ρ ] / [ μ (μ − b ρ) ].\n\n- Combine both contributions:\n  c^2 = γ [ p μ^2/ρ + a ρ ] / [ μ (μ − b ρ) ] − 2a ρ/μ^2.\n\nEquivalently,\n- c^2 = γ μ ( p + a ρ^2/μ^2 ) / [ ρ ( μ − b ρ ) ] − 2 a ρ/μ^2.\n\nStep 5: Checks\n- Ideal gas limit (a → 0, b → 0): c^2 → γ μ p / (ρ μ) = γ p / ρ, as expected.\n- Dimensions: Each term has dimensions of velocity squared.

Because the COM lies above the contact plane (lever arm z_c), this drag creates a pitching torque that must be balanced by a fore–aft asymmetry in the normal pressure, producing a cosθ harmonic in n(θ).\n- The small transverse component of the slip due to rotation (∝ ω r) couples to this asymmetric pressure to generate a net lateral friction force ∝ (ω/v), yielding the curl.\n- The result scales as a_y ∝ μ^2 g (z_c) (ω/v): stronger with higher μ and ω, weaker at larger v, consistent with observed curling behavior.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,a_y \\;\\simeq\\; \\mu^2\\, g\\, z_c\\, \\frac{\\omega}{v}\\; \\approx\\; \\frac{\\mu^2 g h}{2}\\,\\frac{\\omega}{v}\\quad\\text{for a homogeneous cylinder (}z_c\\simeq h/2\\text{)}\\,} \\]"}

Under a boost by v1 along +x (to the ship frame),\nJ'^0 = γ1 (J^0 − β1 J^1) = γ1 (c n − β1 n v2) = c γ1 n (1 − β1 β2).\nHence the dust number density in the ship frame is\nn' = J'^0 / c = γ1 n (1 − β1 β2).\n\nc) Collision rate and momentum transfer in the ship frame\n- Flux onto the frontal area S (perpendicular to the x-axis) in the ship frame is\nR' = n' |u'| S.\n- For a perfectly elastic reflection in the ship frame, the particle’s x-momentum reverses sign. The magnitude of its momentum in the ship frame is p' = γ_rel m |u'|. Therefore, the change in particle momentum is Δp'_particle = 2 p' = 2 γ_rel m |u'|. The equal and opposite impulse acts on the ship, so the dust drag force magnitude in the ship frame is\nF_dust' = R' × (2 γ_rel m |u'|) = 2 S n' γ_rel m |u'|^2.\n\nSubstitute n', γ_rel, and u':\n- n' = γ1 n (1 − β1 β2)\n- γ_rel = γ1 γ2 (1 − β1 β2)\n- |u'| = c |β2 − β1| / (1 − β1 β2)\nThen\nF_dust' = 2 S [γ1 n (1 − β1 β2)] [γ1 γ2 (1 − β1 β2)] m [c^2 (β1 − β2)^2 / (1 − β1 β2)^2]\n= 2 S m n c^2 γ1^2 γ2 (β1 − β2)^2,\nwhere the factor (1 − β1 β2)^2 cancels.\n\nd) Photon thrust and required emission rate\nEach photon emitted backward in the ship frame has momentum magnitude p_ph = h u0 / c. Emitting N' photons per unit time yields a forward thrust magnitude\nF_ph' = N' (h u0) / c.\nFor constant speed in the ship frame, set F_ph' = F_dust':\nN' (h u0)/c = 2 S m n c^2 γ1^2 γ2 (β1 − β2)^2.\n\nSolve for N':\nN' = [2 S m n c^3 γ1^2 γ2 (β1 − β2)^2] / (h u0).\n\nThis may also be written equivalently as\nN' = [2 S m n c γ1^2 γ2 (v1 − v2)^2] / (h u0),\nsince c^3 (β1 − β2)^2 = c (v1 − v2)^2.\n\nNotes:\n- The ship’s rest mass M does not appear because we are balancing forces at constant velocity (no acceleration), so only momentum-transfer rates matter.\n- The result reduces to the classical limit for small speeds: γ1 ≈ γ2 ≈ 1, giving F_dust' ≈ 2 S m n (v1 − v2)^2 and the corresponding photon rate N' ≈ 2 S m n c (v1 − v2)^2 / (h u0).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,N' \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\,S\\,m\\,n\\,c^{3}\\,\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\,\\gamma_{2}\\,(\\beta_{1}-\\beta_{2})^{2}}{h\\,u_{0}} \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\,S\\,m\\,n\\,c\\,\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\,\\gamma_{2}\\,(v_{1}-v_{2})^{2}}{h\\,u_{0}}\\,} \\]"}

Problem Analysis\nWe are given a non-ideal gas with an empirically known equation of state:\np = k T^(3/2) V^(−4/5),\nwith k a constant. We are told that the specific heat ratio γ = Cp/Cv is a constant, independent of T and V. The task is to determine the numerical value of γ.\n\nThis requires relating the thermodynamic response functions Cp and Cv to the given equation of state and then using the constancy of γ to fix its value.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use a general thermodynamic identity that relates the heat capacity difference to the equation of state:\n  Cp − Cv = −T [ (∂p/∂T)_V ]^2 / (∂p/∂V)_T.\n  This allows us to compute Cp − Cv explicitly from p(T,V).\n\n- Determine Cv(T,V) by using the internal-energy identity:\n  (∂U/∂V)_T = T (∂p/∂T)_V − p,\n  and the fact that Cv = (∂U/∂T)_V. Enforcing equality of mixed partials yields (∂Cv/∂V)_T, which we can integrate to obtain Cv up to a function of T.\n\n- Impose that γ = Cp/Cv is a constant (independent of T and V). This constrains the undetermined function and yields the numerical value of γ.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Compute Cp − Cv from the equation of state\nGiven p = k T^(3/2) V^(−4/5), compute the required derivatives:\n- (∂p/∂T)_V = (3/2) k T^(1/2) V^(−4/5),\n- (∂p/∂V)_T = −(4/5) k T^(3/2) V^(−9/5).\n\nUsing the general identity\nCp − Cv = −T [ (∂p/∂T)_V ]^2 / (∂p/∂V)_T,\nwe obtain\nCp − Cv = −T [ (3/2 k T^(1/2) V^(−4/5))^2 ] / [ −(4/5) k T^(3/2) V^(−9/5) ].\n\nSimplify:\n- Numerator: T × (9/4) k^2 T V^(−8/5) = (9/4) k^2 T^2 V^(−8/5),\n- Denominator magnitude: (4/5) k T^(3/2) V^(−9/5).\n\nTherefore,\nCp − Cv = (9/4)/(4/5) × k T^(1/2) × V^(1/5) = (45/16) k T^(1/2) V^(1/5).\n\nSo,\nCp − Cv = (45/16) k T^(1/2) V^(1/5).  … (1)\n\nComment: This result is also consistent with the equivalent identity Cp − Cv = T V α^2/κ_T using α = (1/V)(∂V/∂T)_p and κ_T = −(1/V)(∂V/∂p)_T.\n\nStep 2: Determine Cv(T,V)\nUse the standard identity for internal energy (derivable from the Helmholtz free energy F = U − TS, with dF = −S dT − p dV):\n(∂U/∂V)_T = T (∂p/∂T)_V − p.\n\nFor our equation of state:\n(∂p/∂T)_V = (3/2) k T^(1/2) V^(−4/5) = (3/2) p / T,\nthus\nT (∂p/∂T)_V − p = T × (3/2) p/T − p = (1/2) p.\n\nHence,\n(∂U/∂V)_T = (1/2) p = (1/2) k T^(3/2) V^(−4/5).  … (2)\n\nBut Cv = (∂U/∂T)_V, so by equality of mixed partial derivatives:\n(∂Cv/∂V)_T = ∂/∂T [ (∂U/∂V)_T ] = ∂/∂T [ (1/2) k T^(3/2) V^(−4/5) ].\n\nCompute the T-derivative:\n∂/∂T [ (1/2) k T^(3/2) V^(−4/5) ] = (1/2) k × (3/2) T^(1/2) V^(−4/5) = (3/4) k T^(1/2) V^(−4/5).\n\nTherefore,\n(∂Cv/∂V)_T = (3/4) k T^(1/2) V^(−4/5).  … (3)\n\nIntegrate with respect to V at fixed T:\nCv(T,V) = ∫ (3/4) k T^(1/2) V^(−4/5) dV + g(T)\n= (3/4) k T^(1/2) × [ V^(1/5)/(1/5) ] + g(T)\n= (15/4) k T^(1/2) V^(1/5) + g(T),  … (4)\nwhere g(T) is an integration “constant” (a function of T only).\n\nStep 3: Impose constancy of γ\nBy definition,\nγ = Cp/Cv = 1 + (Cp − Cv)/Cv.\n\nUsing (1) and (4),\n(Cp − Cv)/Cv = [ (45/16) k T^(1/2) V^(1/5) ] / [ (15/4) k T^(1/2) V^(1/5) + g(T) ].\n\nFor γ to be a constant independent of T and V, the ratio above must be independent of T and V. The numerator scales as T^(1/2) V^(1/5), whereas the denominator is a sum of a term proportional to T^(1/2) V^(1/5) and a T-only term g(T). The only way to eliminate residual state dependence is to set g(T) = 0. Hence,\nCv(T,V) = (15/4) k T^(1/2) V^(1/5).\n\nThen,\nγ − 1 = (Cp − Cv)/Cv = [ (45/16) k ] / [ (15/4) k ] = (45/16) × (4/15) = 3/4.\n\nTherefore,\nγ = 1 + 3/4 = 7/4.\n\n4. Final Answer\nThe specific heat ratio is a constant with numerical value γ = 7/4.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\gamma = \\tfrac{7}{4}} \\]"}

The quadratic coefficient gives an effective spring constant k_eff, from which ω = sqrt(k_eff/m).\n- Use the beam’s second moment of area I = a h^3/12 (bending about the strong axis), so EI is the flexural rigidity.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep 1: Compliance (deflection at the load) for a simply supported beam\n- For a simply supported beam of span l under a point load P applied at position ξ from the left support, the deflection at the point of application is a standard result:\n  δ(ξ) = P ξ^2 (l − ξ)^2 / (3 E I l)\n  Hence the compliance is C(ξ) = δ(ξ)/P = ξ^2 (l − ξ)^2 / (3 E I l).\n- Sanity check at midspan (ξ = l/2):\n  δ_mid = P (l/2)^2 (l/2)^2 / (3 E I l) = P l^3 / (48 E I), as expected.\n\nStep 2: Total potential energy as a function of ξ\n- Let P = mg. The total potential energy of the load–beam system (strain energy minus work by the external force) is:\n  Π(ξ) = −(1/2) P^2 C(ξ) = −(1/2) (mg)^2 C(ξ).\n\nStep 3: Expand Π about the equilibrium at midspan\n- Let ξ = l/2 + x, where x is a small displacement along the beam from the center.\n- Compute C(ξ) in terms of x:\n  C(ξ) = [ξ^2 (l − ξ)^2] / (3 E I l) = [ (ξ (l − ξ))^2 ] / (3 E I l).\n  With ξ = l/2 + x, we have ξ (l − ξ) = (l/2 + x)(l/2 − x) = (l^2/4 − x^2).\n  Therefore,\n  C(x) = [ (l^2/4 − x^2)^2 ] / (3 E I l) = [ l^4/16 − (l^2/2) x^2 + x^4 ] / (3 E I l).\n- Keep terms up to x^2 (small oscillations):\n  C(x) ≈ l^4/(48 E I) − [ l/(6 E I) ] x^2.\n- Then\n  Π(x) = −(1/2) P^2 C(x) ≈ −(1/2) P^2 [ l^4/(48 E I) − l/(6 E I) x^2 ].\n  = constant + [ P^2 l / (12 E I) ] x^2, up to O(x^4).\n- Near equilibrium, a quadratic potential Π(x) = Π0 + (1/2) k_eff x^2 identifies the effective spring constant:\n  (1/2) k_eff = P^2 l / (12 E I)  ⇒  k_eff = P^2 l / (6 E I) = (m g)^2 l / (6 E I).\n\nStep 4: Small-oscillation angular frequency\n- With beam mass neglected, the effective mass is m (the vertical motion is higher order in x because the slope at midspan is zero; to leading order the kinetic energy is (1/2) m ẋ^2).\n- Hence\n  ω = sqrt( k_eff / m ) = sqrt( (m g)^2 l / (6 E I m) ) = g sqrt( m l / (6 E I) ).\n- Substitute I = a h^3 / 12:\n  ω = g sqrt( m l / [6 E (a h^3 / 12)] ) = g sqrt( 2 m l / (E a h^3) ).\n\n4) Key Concepts Briefly Explained\n- Compliance C = δ/P: For a linear elastic structure, the displacement at the point of a load is proportional to the load; the proportionality constant is the compliance.\n- Strain energy under a point load: U = (1/2) P δ for linear systems. Total potential energy Π = U − W_ext = (1/2) P δ − P δ = −(1/2) P δ.\n- Small oscillations: If Π ≈ Π0 + (1/2) k_eff x^2 near equilibrium, then ω = sqrt(k_eff/m_eff).\n\n5) Validity and Assumptions\n- Small deflections and slopes (linear beam theory).\n- The mass of the beam is negligible compared to m.\n- The load slides along the beam with negligible friction, and the motion is small and about the center where the slope is zero.\n- The bending axis corresponds to I = a h^3/12 (thickness h is the bending depth).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\omega \\;=\\; g\\,\\sqrt{\\dfrac{2\\,m\\,l}{E\\,a\\,h^{3}}} } \\]"}
{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession. Solve for its precession angular frequency $\\Omega$ (the answer can be expressed in terms of $q_{0}$ and $r_{0}$).", "solutions": "According to the problem statement, a single ideal gas under the isothermal model can satisfy the Boltzmann distribution in any continuous potential energy field distribution.

Because mi ≫ me, ions are more strongly flung outward than electrons, leading to a net space charge ρ(r) and a radial electric field Er(r).\n- A UAV of mass m and net charge q0 orbits with the flow at radius r0 with angular speed ω, exerting thrust only vertically. After a small radial perturbation with small initial radial velocity v0, it exhibits small, periodic radial oscillations (“precession” in the orbital sense).\n- Goal: Determine the precession angular frequency Ω of these small oscillations about r0. The result should be expressed in terms of q0 and r0 (and known system parameters).\n\n2) Approach\n\n- Determine the equilibrium number density profiles of ions and electrons in the rotating, isothermal gas using Boltzmann factors in the rotating frame including only the centrifugal potential, as instructed: ns(r) ∝ exp(ks ms r^2), with k = ω^2/(2 kB T0).\n- Normalize the densities using the total particle numbers N in the cylinder.\n- Compute the space charge ρ(r) = e[ni(r) − ne(r)] and the radial electric field Er(r) from Gauss’s law for a long cylinder.\n- Impose the equilibrium circular co-rotation condition at r0: q0 Er(r0) + m ω^2 r0 = 0.\n- Linearize the radial equation of motion for small perturbations about r0 to obtain a simple harmonic oscillator. Extract Ω in two equivalent forms:\n  - A compact, general dynamical form in terms of the local field gradient Er′(r0);\n  - An explicit form in terms of the known distribution parameters by eliminating Er′(r0) using Gauss’s law and the equilibrium condition.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\n3.1) Species density profiles in rigid, isothermal rotation\n\n- In the rotating frame, the (per-particle) centrifugal potential is Ucent(r) = −(1/2) ms ω^2 r^2. For an isothermal ideal gas, the Boltzmann factor gives\n  ns(r) = As exp(+ ms ω^2 r^2 / (2 kB T0)) = As exp(αs r^2),\n  where we define αs ≡ k ms, with k ≡ ω^2/(2 kB T0).\n- Species: s = i (ion, mi ≈ mtot), s = e (electron, me). We take ions and electrons to be singly ionized and confined; their total numbers in the cylinder are equal: Ni = Ne = N.\n\nNormalization (H ≫ R; uniform along z):\n- Total number constraint:\n  N = ∫V ns dV = 2π H ∫0^R ns(r) r dr = 2π H As ∫0^R e^{αs r^2} r dr.\n- The radial integral evaluates to\n  ∫0^R e^{αs r^2} r dr = (e^{αs R^2} − 1)/(2 αs).\n- Hence\n  As = N αs / [π H (e^{αs R^2} − 1)].\nThus\n  ns(r) = [N αs / (π H (e^{αs R^2} − 1))] e^{αs r^2}.\n\n3.2) Space charge density and radial electric field\n\n- Charge density:\n  ρ(r) = e [ni(r) − ne(r)]\n        = e N/(π H) [ αi e^{αi r^2}/(e^{αi R^2} − 1) − αe e^{αe r^2}/(e^{αe R^2} − 1) ].\n\n- Gauss’s law in cylindrical symmetry (H ≫ R) for a long cylinder gives\n  E_r(r) = (1/(ε0 r)) ∫_0^r ρ(r′) r′ dr′.\n  Carrying out the integral explicitly with the forms above yields a compact closed form:\n  E_r(r) = (e N)/(2 π ε0 H) (1/r) [ (e^{αi r^2} − 1)/(e^{αi R^2} − 1) − (e^{αe r^2} − 1)/(e^{αe R^2} − 1) ].\n\nIt is also useful to note the differential form of Gauss’s law in this geometry:\n  dE_r/dr + (E_r/r) = ρ(r)/ε0.     (1)\n\n3.3) Equilibrium co-rotation condition at r0\n\n- The UAV co-rotates at r0 with angular speed ω and has no horizontal thrust; the radial force balance (in inertial frame for uniform circular motion, or equivalently in the rotating frame with v′ = 0) is\n  m (−ω^2 r0) = q0 E_r(r0),\n  i.e.,\n  q0 E_r(r0) + m ω^2 r0 = 0.        (2)\n\nThis determines the sign relation between q0 and Er(r0) required for a steady circular co-rotation at r0.\n\n3.4) Small radial perturbations: linearization and Ω\n\nStart from the exact planar equations in inertial coordinates (no azimuthal force):\n- Radial equation:\n  r̈ − r θ̇^2 = (q0/m) E_r(r).       (3)\n- Azimuthal equation (no tangential force → angular momentum conservation):\n  d/dt (r^2 θ̇) = 0 ⇒ r^2 θ̇ = const = r0^2 ω.       (4)\n\nEliminate θ̇^2 using (4). From r^2 θ̇ = r0^2 ω ⇒ θ̇ = (r0^2 ω)/r^2, hence\n  r θ̇^2 = (r0^4 ω^2)/r^3.\nPlugging into (3):\n  r̈ − (r0^4 ω^2)/r^3 = (q0/m) E_r(r).                (5)\n\nLinearize around the equilibrium r = r0 by writing r = r0 + x with |x| ≪ r0. Expand the term f(r) = (r0^4 ω^2)/r^3:\n- f(r0) = ω^2 r0, f′(r) = −3 (r0^4 ω^2)/r^4 ⇒ f′(r0) = −3 ω^2.\nThus, to first order:\n  r̈ − [ω^2 r0 − 3 ω^2 x] = (q0/m)[E_r(r0) + E_r′(r0) x].\nUse the equilibrium condition (2) to cancel the constant terms:\n  −ω^2 r0 = (q0/m) E_r(r0).\nThe linearized equation becomes\n  ẍ + [3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E_r′(r0)] x = 0.               (6)\n\nTherefore, the small radial oscillations (the “precession”) are harmonic with angular frequency\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E_r′(r0).                      (7)\n\n3.5) Eliminating E_r′(r0) and explicit form in terms of r0, q0, and known parameters\n\nUse cylindrical Gauss’s law (1) at r0:\n  E_r′(r0) = ρ(r0)/ε0 − E_r(r0)/r0.\nUse the equilibrium condition (2) to eliminate E_r(r0):\n  E_r(r0) = − m ω^2 r0 / q0.\nHence\n  E_r′(r0) = ρ(r0)/ε0 + m ω^2 / q0.                   (8)\n\nSubstitute (8) into (7):\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) [ ρ(r0)/ε0 + m ω^2 / q0 ]\n       = 2 ω^2 − (q0/(m ε0)) ρ(r0).                   (9)\n\nFinally substitute ρ(r0) from Section 3.2:\n- Define αs = k ms with k = ω^2/(2 kB T0). Then\n  ρ(r0) = e N/(π H) [ αi e^{αi r0^2}/(e^{αi R^2} − 1) − αe e^{αe r0^2}/(e^{αe R^2} − 1) ].\nTherefore\n  Ω^2 = 2 ω^2 − (q0 e N)/(m ε0 π H)\n        [ αi e^{αi r0^2}/(e^{αi R^2} − 1) − αe e^{αe r0^2}/(e^{αe R^2} − 1) ].   (10)\n\nRemarks:\n- Stability requires Ω^2 > 0, which constrains the sign and magnitude of q0 relative to the local charge density ρ(r0).\n- Two equivalent, useful forms of the frequency are (7) and (9); (10) provides the explicit dependence on T0, masses, ω, and geometry via αs and N, H, R.\n\n4) Summary of Key Relations\n\n- Species density profiles:\n  ns(r) = [N αs / (π H (e^{αs R^2} − 1))] e^{αs r^2}, with αs = (ω^2 ms)/(2 kB T0).\n- Electric field:\n  E_r(r) = (e N)/(2 π ε0 H) (1/r) [ (e^{αi r^2} − 1)/(e^{αi R^2} − 1) − (e^{αe r^2} − 1)/(e^{αe R^2} − 1) ].\n- Co-rotation balance at r0: q0 E_r(r0) + m ω^2 r0 = 0.\n- Precession frequency:\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E_r′(r0) = 2 ω^2 − (q0/(m ε0)) ρ(r0),\n  with ρ(r0) as above.\n\nThese give a complete, self-consistent determination of Ω in terms of q0, r0, and the specified typhoon/plasma parameters.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\Omega \\;=\\; \\left[\\, 2\\,\\omega^{2}\\;-\\;\\frac{q_{0}}{m\\,\\varepsilon_{0}}\\,\\rho(r_{0}) \\,\\right]^{1/2}\n\\;=\\;\\left[\\, 3\\,\\omega^{2}\\;-\\;\\frac{q_{0}}{m}\\,E_{r}'(r_{0}) \\,\\right]^{1/2}}\\]\nwith\n\\[\\rho(r_{0}) \\;=\\; \\frac{e\\,N}{\\pi H}\\!\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_{i}\\,e^{\\alpha_{i} r_{0}^{2}}}{e^{\\alpha_{i} R^{2}}-1}\\;-\\;\\frac{\\alpha_{e}\\,e^{\\alpha_{e} r_{0}^{2}}}{e^{\\alpha_{e} R^{2}}-1}\\right],\\quad \\alpha_{s}=\\frac{\\omega^{2} m_{s}}{2 k_{B} T_{0}},\\]\nand the steady co-rotation condition q0 E_r(r0) + m ω^2 r0 = 0."}
