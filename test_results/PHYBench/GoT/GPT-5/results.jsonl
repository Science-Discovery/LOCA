The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

Problem Analysis\n- We are asked to compute the Verdet constant v(ω) for the Faraday effect in a medium modeled by the (lossless) Lorentz oscillator model. The Faraday rotation angle β for light of angular frequency ω propagating a distance d in a magnetic field B (collinear with the propagation direction) is β = v B d. The task is to derive v(ω) in terms of the material parameters and the optical dispersion near ω (refractive index n).\n\n- Physical picture: In a longitudinal magnetic field, the right- and left-circularly polarized eigenmodes experience slightly different refractive indices n± due to the Lorentz-force term, yielding a phase difference and hence rotation of the polarization plane. The goal is to find the small-B difference n+ − n− and relate it to v.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use the Lorentz oscillator model for outer-shell electrons interacting with the optical field:\n  m r¨ + m ω0^2 r = −e E − e r˙ × B, with no damping (no absorption).\n- Choose B along the propagation direction (Faraday geometry), and work in the circular polarization basis, which diagonalizes the magneto-optic response.\n- Obtain n±^2(ω, B) and expand to first order in B (small ωc = eB/m). Use the compact “resonance-shift” shortcut: to leading order, n±(ω, B) ≈ n(ω ± ωc/2).\n- Use the standard rotatory power relation dβ/dz = (ω/2c)(n+ − n−) to identify the Verdet constant v(ω) from dβ/dz = v B.\n- Compute dn/dω from the Lorentz dispersion n^2(ω) = 1 + ωp^2/(ω0^2 − ω^2) with ωp^2 = N Z e^2/(ε0 m), and substitute to get v(ω) explicitly.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Electron dynamics and circular eigenmodes\n- Equation of motion for an outer electron (charge −e, mass m) in an oscillatory field E(t) = Re{E e−iωt} and a static magnetic field B = B ẑ:\n  m r¨ + m ω0^2 r = −e E − e r˙ × B\n- Assume harmonic time dependence r(t) = Re{r e−iωt}, so r¨ = −ω^2 r and r˙ = −iω r. Then:\n  [m(ω0^2 − ω^2)] r + i e ω r × B = −e E\n- In the circular basis r± = x ± i y and E± = Ex ± i Ey, the operator r × B (with B ∥ ẑ) has eigenvalues ± i B on these circular components. Therefore:\n  [m(ω0^2 − ω^2) ∓ e ω B] r± = −e E±\n  r± = − e E± / [m(ω0^2 − ω^2) ∓ e ω B]\n- The polarization P = −N Z e r gives the circular susceptibilities χ± via P± = ε0 χ± E±:\n  χ±(ω, B) = N Z e^2/(ε0 m) · 1/[ω0^2 − ω^2 ∓ ω ωc]\n  where ωc = e B/m and ωp^2 ≡ N Z e^2/(ε0 m).\n  Hence χ±(ω, B) = ωp^2 / [ω0^2 − ω^2 ∓ ω ωc]\n\nStep 2: Circular refractive indices\n- For a nonmagnetic dielectric (μ ≈ μ0), n±^2(ω, B) = 1 + χ±(ω, B):\n  n±^2(ω, B) = 1 + ωp^2 / [ω0^2 − ω^2 ∓ ω ωc]\n\nStep 3: Small-B expansion; resonance-shift shortcut\n- Let n(ω) denote the refractive index at B = 0:\n  n^2(ω) = 1 + ωp^2/(ω0^2 − ω^2)\n- For small ωc, note that ω0^2 − ω^2 ∓ ω ωc ≈ ω0^2 − (ω ± ωc/2)^2 to first order, since\n  ω0^2 − (ω ± δω)^2 ≈ ω0^2 − ω^2 ∓ 2 ω δω; choosing δω = ωc/2 reproduces the ∓ ω ωc term.\n- Therefore, to first order in B:\n  n±(ω, B) ≈ n(ω ± ωc/2)\n  ⇒ n+ − n− ≈ ωc (dn/dω)\n\nStep 4: Rotation per unit length and Verdet constant\n- A linearly polarized wave is the equal superposition of the two circular eigenmodes. After propagation by distance z, the relative phase is Δφ = (k+ − k−) z with k± = (ω/c) n±. The rotation angle is β(z) = Δφ/2, so:\n  dβ/dz = (k+ − k−)/2 = (ω/2c)(n+ − n−) ≈ (ω/2c) ωc (dn/dω)\n- Identifying dβ/dz = v(ω) B, and using ωc = e B/m, we obtain the general dispersion form of the Verdet constant:\n  v(ω) = (e/(2 m c)) ω (dn/dω)\n- An equivalent and often-used wavelength form follows from ω = 2π c/λ:\n  v(λ) = − (e/(2 m c)) λ (dn/dλ)\n\nStep 5: dn/dω from the Lorentz model (no absorption)\n- With n^2(ω) = 1 + ωp^2/(ω0^2 − ω^2), differentiate:\n  2 n (dn/dω) = ωp^2 d/dω[(ω0^2 − ω^2)−1]\n               = ωp^2 · [2 ω/(ω0^2 − ω^2)^2]\n  ⇒ dn/dω = [ω ωp^2]/[n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2]\n- Substitute into v(ω):\n  v(ω) = (e/(2 m c)) ω · [ω ωp^2]/[n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2]\n       = [e ω^2 ωp^2]/[2 m c n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2]\n- Using ωp^2 = N Z e^2/(ε0 m) yields the explicit Lorentz-model result:\n  v(ω) = [N Z e^3]/[2 ε0 m^2 c] · [ω^2]/[n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2]\n\n- The total rotation for path length d in magnetic field B is β = v(ω) B d.\n\n4.

In the inertial frame its angle advances by the sum of the disk’s angle and the relative angle, i.e., 2ωt:\n  ρ(t) = R e^{i 2 ω t}.\n- Hence the bug’s position is:\n  r(t) = c(t) + ρ(t) = R e^{i ω t} + R e^{i 2 ω t}.\n\nRemarks:\n- At t = 0: r(0) = 2R (on the x-axis), which lies on the disk rim (radius = 2R).\n- In general, |r(t)| = |R e^{i ω t} + R e^{i 2 ω t}| ≤ 2R, so the bug always remains on the disk.\n\nStep 2: Compute acceleration\nDifferentiate twice:\n- Velocity: ṙ(t) = i ω R e^{i ω t} + i (2 ω) R e^{i 2 ω t}.\n- Acceleration:\n  a(t) = r̈(t) = −ω^2 R e^{i ω t} − 4 ω^2 R e^{i 2 ω t}.\n\nThus a(t) is the vector sum of two uniform-circular-motion centripetal accelerations:\n- One of magnitude ω^2 R, rotating at ω.\n- One of magnitude 4 ω^2 R, rotating at 2ω.\n\nStep 3: Time dependence and maximum of |a(t)|\nCompute the magnitude squared:\n|a(t)|^2 = ω^4 R^2 |e^{i ω t} + 4 e^{i 2 ω t}|^2\n= ω^4 R^2 [|e^{i ω t}|^2 + 16|e^{i 2 ω t}|^2 + 2·4 Re(e^{-i ω t} e^{i 2 ω t})]\n= ω^4 R^2 (1 + 16 + 8 cos ω t)\n= ω^4 R^2 (17 + 8 cos ω t).\n\nTherefore,\n|a(t)| = ω^2 R sqrt(17 + 8 cos ω t).\n\n- Maximum occurs at cos ω t = 1:\n  |a|_max = ω^2 R sqrt(17 + 8) = 5 ω^2 R.\n- Minimum occurs at cos ω t = −1:\n  |a|_min = ω^2 R sqrt(17 − 8) = 3 ω^2 R.\n\nTimes of extrema:\n- Maxima when ω t = 2π k (k ∈ ℤ), i.e., t = 2π k/ω. At these instants r(t) = R e^{i ω t} + R e^{i 2 ω t} = 2R e^{i ω t}, so the bug is at the disk rim.\n- Minima when ω t = (2k + 1)π, i.e., t = (2k + 1)π/ω. Then r(t) = 0, so the bug is at the center.\n\nStep 4: Force and the requested maximum\nWith no gravity, the required contact force between the bug and the disk equals the mass times the acceleration magnitude:\nF(t) = m |a(t)| = m ω^2 R sqrt(17 + 8 cos ω t).\n\nHence the maximum force is\nF_max = m |a|_max = 5 m ω^2 R.\n\nCross-check by triangle inequality:\n- From a(t) = −ω^2 R e^{i ω t} − 4 ω^2 R e^{i 2 ω t}, the triangle inequality gives |a| ≤ ω^2 R + 4 ω^2 R = 5 ω^2 R, with equality when the two phasors are aligned (ω t = 2 ω t mod 2π ⇒ t = 2π k/ω). This matches the explicit calculation.\n\n4. Final Answer\nThe maximum force required between the bug and the disk is attained when the bug is on the disk rim and equals 5 m ω^2 R.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{F_{\\max} = 5\\,m\\,\\omega^{2} R} \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We consider the deuteron as a two-body system (proton and neutron) interacting via an attractive Yukawa potential U(r) = -A e^{-r/λ}/r, with range parameter λ = h/(2π m c) = ħ/(m c).\n- The problem asks: if the separation between the particles is r and they execute small radial oscillations about a circular orbit (i.e., near-circular motion without collision), what is the azimuthal angle Δφ accumulated about the center of mass during one complete cycle of the small radial oscillation?\n- In orbital dynamics, this Δφ is the apsidal angle (the angle advanced between successive pericenter passages) for near-circular motion.\n\n2. Approach\n- Reduce the two-body problem to motion of the relative coordinate in a central potential with reduced mass μ.\n- For nearly circular orbits, small radial oscillations occur with the epicyclic (radial) frequency κ, while the mean azimuthal angular frequency is Ω. The angle advanced during one radial period is Δφ = Ω Tr = Ω (2π/κ) = 2π (Ω/κ).\n- Use a general identity for central forces that relates the ratio κ^2/Ω^2 to the logarithmic radial slope of the central force F(r):\n  κ^2/Ω^2 = 3 + d ln F / d ln r.\n- Compute F(r) for the Yukawa potential, evaluate d ln F/d ln r, and thus obtain Δφ in terms of r and λ. Note that the overall strength A cancels in the ratio.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Two-body reduction and key definitions\n- Let μ be the reduced mass of the proton–neutron system and r the relative separation.\n- Potential: U(r) = -A e^{-r/λ}/r, with A > 0 and λ = ħ/(m c).\n- Central force (radial, attractive): F_r = -dU/dr. We will work with the magnitude F(r) = |F_r| = -F_r > 0.\n\nStep 2: Force and its logarithmic derivative\nCompute F(r):\n- Differentiate U(r):\n  dU/dr = -A d/dr[e^{-r/λ}/r]\n         = -A e^{-r/λ} [ -1/(λ r) - 1/r^2 ] \n         = A e^{-r/λ} [ 1/(λ r) + 1/r^2 ].\n- Hence the inward force magnitude is\n  F(r) = A e^{-r/λ} ( 1/(λ r) + 1/r^2 )\n       = A e^{-r/λ} (r + λ)/(λ r^2).\n\nCompute s ≡ d ln F/d ln r:\n- Write ln F = ln A − r/λ + ln(r + λ) − ln λ − 2 ln r.\n- Differentiate with respect to ln r (i.e., multiply d/dr by r):\n  s = d ln F/d ln r\n    = (−1/λ) r + r/(r + λ) − 2\n    = − r/λ + r/(r + λ) − 2.\n\nStep 3: Relation between κ and Ω for a central force\n- For a circular orbit of radius r, the azimuthal frequency is Ω via the balance F(r) = μ r Ω^2.\n- The small-radial-oscillation (epicyclic) frequency κ can be obtained from the effective potential, yielding the standard identity:\n  κ^2 = 3 Ω^2 − (1/μ) dF/dr\n  ⇒ κ^2/Ω^2 = 3 − r F′(r)/F(r) = 3 + d ln F/d ln r.\n- Using s from above:\n  κ^2/Ω^2 = 3 + s\n           = 3 + [− r/λ + r/(r + λ) − 2]\n           = 1 − r/λ + r/(r + λ).\n\nIt is convenient to rewrite this as a single fraction:\n- 1 − r/λ + r/(r + λ) \n  = 1 + r [ −1/λ + 1/(r + λ) ]\n  = 1 − r^2 / [ λ (r + λ) ].\nEquivalently, in terms of x ≡ r/λ:\n- κ^2/Ω^2 = (1 + x − x^2)/(1 + x).\n\nStep 4: Angle advanced per radial period\n- One full radial oscillation takes time Tr = 2π/κ, during which the azimuth advances by\n  Δφ = Ω Tr = 2π (Ω/κ) = 2π / sqrt(κ^2/Ω^2).\n- Substitute the result above:\n  Δφ = 2π / sqrt(1 − r^2/[λ (r + λ)])\n      = 2π sqrt( (1 + r/λ) / (1 + r/λ − (r/λ)^2) ).\n\nStep 5: Consistency checks and physical remarks\n- Coulomb/Kepler limit (λ → ∞): κ^2/Ω^2 → 1, hence Δφ → 2π, giving closed Keplerian ellipses as expected.\n- Small-radius expansion (r ≪ λ): κ^2/Ω^2 ≈ 1 − (r/λ)^2, so Δφ ≈ 2π [1 + (1/2) (r/λ)^2 + …] > 2π, implying a small prograde apsidal advance.\n- Stability bound: small oscillations require κ^2 > 0, i.e.,\n  1 − r^2/[λ (r + λ)] > 0 ⇔ r/λ < (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618.\n  Beyond this, the circular orbit is unstable under the short-range Yukawa interaction.\n\n4.

A vertical impulse is applied at the right side (overhanging side), giving the disk an initial motion.\n- Immediately after the impact, the coin’s motion is constrained by the tabletop at the left rim point (the last point still in contact), so that point has zero vertical velocity. The coin then executes instantaneous pure rotation about that point.\n- As the coin pitches upward, it may lose contact (fly off) if the normal reaction becomes zero at some point. We are asked to find the minimum initial speed of the center of mass v0,min (right after impact) that guarantees the coin will lose contact and leave the table. The answer should be expressed in terms of g and r only.\n\n2) Approach\n- Use the instantaneous center of zero velocity at the leftmost contact point with the tabletop edge. Immediately after impact, the motion is equivalent to pure rotation about that point.\n- Replace the disk by an equivalent “physical pendulum” about that contact point. The relevant moment of inertia about that point is obtained via the parallel-axis theorem.\n- Use energy conservation from the initial state (just after impact) to the configuration in which the center of mass (COM) is directly above the contact point (the “vertical” configuration). The center of mass rises by a height r in that motion.\n- The minimal initial speed is the separatrix: the coin just reaches the vertical configuration with zero angular speed. At that instant, the normal reaction is zero, so the coin can leave the table.\n- Verify the contact condition with a radial (normal) force balance to ensure liftoff is consistent at the threshold.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep A: Kinematics right after impact (instantaneous rotation about the left rim point)\n- Let P be the leftmost point of the rim that remains in contact with the tabletop at the edge.\n- Because the tabletop is smooth and constrains vertical motion at P, that point has zero vertical velocity immediately after the impulse. Thus, the motion is instantaneously a pure rotation about P with angular speed Ω0.\n- The COM is at the disk’s center, a distance r from P, so\n  v0 = Ω0 r  ⇒  Ω0 = v0 / r.\n\nStep B: Kinetic energy expressed via the moment of inertia about P\n- For a thin uniform disk of radius r:\n  - About a diameter (an axis in the plane of the disk through the center): I_diam = (1/4) m r^2.\n- By the parallel-axis theorem, the moment of inertia about point P (in the same axis direction) is\n  I_P = I_diam + m r^2 = (1/4) m r^2 + m r^2 = (5/4) m r^2.\n- The initial kinetic energy (immediately after impact) is purely rotational about P:\n  K0 = (1/2) I_P Ω0^2 = (1/2)(5/4 m r^2)(v0^2/r^2) = (5/8) m v0^2.\n  Equivalently, K0 = (1/2) m v0^2 + (1/2) I_diam Ω0^2 = (1/2) m v0^2 + (1/8) m v0^2 = (5/8) m v0^2.\n\nStep C: Potential energy rise to the vertical configuration\n- As the coin rotates from “horizontal” (COM at the same height as P) to “vertical” (COM directly above P), the COM rises by Δh = r.\n- The corresponding increase in gravitational potential energy is ΔU = m g Δh = m g r.\n\nStep D: Threshold condition from energy\n- For the coin to be able to reach the vertical configuration, the initial kinetic energy must at least equal the potential energy gain. At the minimum threshold (separatrix), it arrives with zero angular speed at vertical:\n  K0 = ΔU\n  (5/8) m v0^2 = m g r\n  ⇒ v0,min^2 = (8/5) g r\n  ⇒ v0,min = sqrt(8 g r / 5).\n\nStep E: Contact/liftoff consistency check (normal force)\n- While in contact and rotating about P, the radial force balance along the line from P to the COM gives\n  N − m g cos θ = m r Ω^2,\n  where θ is the angle of the COM above the horizontal line through P (θ = 0 at start; θ = π/2 at vertical), and N is the normal reaction.\n- For 0 ≤ θ < π/2, cos θ > 0, so N = m r Ω^2 + m g cos θ > 0; contact cannot be lost before θ = π/2.\n- At θ = π/2 (COM directly above P), cos θ = 0, giving N = m r Ω^2. At the threshold we found, the coin reaches θ = π/2 with Ω = 0, hence N = 0 exactly: the contact becomes inactive and the coin can fly off. This confirms the consistency of the threshold obtained by energy.\n\nTherefore, the minimum initial center-of-mass speed needed for the coin to leave the table is\nv0,min = sqrt(8 g r / 5).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{v_{0,\\min}=\\sqrt{\\frac{8}{5}\\,g\\,r}} \\]"}

A hammer strikes the top mass horizontally, giving it an instantaneous horizontal speed v0 at t = 0+.\n- We are asked for the instantaneous tension in the middle string (between the top and middle masses) at t = 0+.\n- Gravity acts downward with acceleration g.\n\nKey observation: At the instant right after the strike, all strings are vertical; velocities are purely horizontal; vertical velocities are still zero, but vertical accelerations need not be zero. For an inextensible string of length l that is instantaneously vertical, the second derivative of the length constraint enforces a relation between the relative vertical accelerations of the endpoints and the square of their instantaneous relative transverse (horizontal) speed.\n\n2) Approach\n- Use the holonomic length constraint for each string, differentiated twice. For two points A and B connected by a rigid link s = rA − rB (|s| = l), one has:\n  |vA − vB|^2 + s · (aA − aB) = 0.\n  At t = 0+, s is vertical, while all relevant relative velocities are horizontal, so the above reduces to a simple scalar relation along the vertical.\n- Apply this to the three links:\n  - Ceiling–top: nonzero relative speed v0.\n  - Top–middle: nonzero relative speed v0 (top moves horizontally, middle does not yet).\n  - Middle–bottom: zero relative speed.\n- Combine these kinematic constraints with vertical force balances (Newton’s second law) for each mass to solve for the tensions. We denote:\n  - a1, a2, a3: vertical accelerations (upward positive) of top, middle, bottom masses, respectively.\n  - Tu: tension in ceiling–top string (upward on the top mass).\n  - Tm: tension in the middle string (upward on the middle, downward on the top). This is the quantity sought.\n  - Tb: tension in the bottom string (upward on the bottom mass).\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep A: Kinematic (constraint) equations at t = 0+\n- Ceiling–top link. Let s = rC − r1 (upward, |s| = l). With vC = 0 and v1 horizontal v0, the second derivative constraint gives:\n  s · (aC − a1) = −|vC − v1|^2 = −v0^2\n  −l a1 = −v0^2  ⇒  a1 = v0^2 / l.\n\n- Top–middle link. Let s = r1 − r2 (upward, |s| = l). With v1 − v2 = v0 (horizontal),\n  s · (a1 − a2) = −|v1 − v2|^2 = −v0^2\n  l (a1 − a2) = −v0^2  ⇒  a1 − a2 = − v0^2 / l  ⇒  a2 = a1 + v0^2 / l = 2 v0^2 / l.\n\n- Middle–bottom link. Here v2 − v3 = 0 initially, so\n  s · (a2 − a3) = 0  ⇒  a2 = a3 = 2 v0^2 / l.\n\nSummary of accelerations at t = 0+:\n- a1 = v0^2 / l,  a2 = a3 = 2 v0^2 / l.\n\nStep B: Vertical force balances (Newton’s second law; upward positive)\n- Top mass:\n  Tu − Tm − m g = m a1 = m (v0^2 / l).

Conditions: r < b < R and r + b < R (so the inner cylinder is strictly inside and never touches the outer).\n- The inner cylinder is held at temperature T1 and the outer at temperature T2 by their respective heat sources.\n- We are asked for the power per unit area p(θ) that must be supplied at a point P on the inner surface of the outer cylinder at polar angle θ (measured from the line joining O2 to O1), i.e., the local heat-flux density from the heat source that maintains the outer surface at T2 in the presence of radiative exchange within the cavity.\n\n2) Approach\n- For black, diffuse surfaces, the local radiosity at the outer surface is J2 = σ T2^4. The local irradiation G(P) incident on that point comes from two sources:\n  - Emission by the inner cylinder at temperature T1, scaled by the local view factor F(θ).\n  - Emission by the rest of the outer surface itself at temperature T2, through the complementary view factor 1 − F(θ).\n- The local energy balance at the outer surface is J2 = G(P) + p(θ), with p(θ) being the external heat supply (positive when heating).\n- Therefore p(θ) reduces to a very simple expression once the local point-to-surface view factor F(θ) from P to the inner cylinder is known.\n- We compute F(θ) via a geometric projected-angle integral in the cross-section: the set of rays from P that intersect the inner circle is a wedge defined by tangency; integrating cosine-weighted contributions across that wedge gives a function proportional to (R − b cosθ)/d^2, where d is the distance from P to the inner center. A normalization constant is then fixed by reciprocity/energy conservation (area-averaged view factor must equal r/R).\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\n3.1) Geometry\n- Place O2 at the origin and O1 on the x-axis: O1 = (b, 0).\n- A point P on the inner side of the outer cylinder (of radius R) is P(θ) = (R cosθ, R sinθ).\n- Vector from P to the inner center O1: c = O1 − P = (b − R cosθ, −R sinθ).\n- Distance d = |c| = sqrt(R^2 + b^2 − 2 b R cosθ).\n- The unit inward normal to the outer surface at P is n_in = −(cosθ, sinθ).\n\n3.2) Local irradiance and the local view factor\n- For black diffuse emission from the inner cylinder, the relevant directional weighting to compute the fraction of irradiance arriving at P is the cosine projection onto the inward normal at P.\n- The set of directions from P that intersect the inner circle is the angular wedge around c bounded by its two tangents. Let α be the half-aperture of this wedge. By simple geometry, sinα = r/d.\n- Let Δ be the angle between c and n_in. Using the vectors above,\n  cosΔ = (c/|c|) ⋅ n_in = [(b − R cosθ)(−cosθ) + (−R sinθ)(−sinθ)]/d = (R − b cosθ)/d.\n- The cosine-weighted angular integral over the visible wedge is\n  ∫_visible cosψ dϕ = ∫_{−α}^{+α} cos(ϕ − 0) dϕ projected relative to n_in\n                     = 2 sinα cosΔ\n                     = 2 (r/d) [(R − b cosθ)/d]\n                     = 2 r (R − b cosθ)/d^2,\n  where d^2 = R^2 + b^2 − 2 b R cosθ.\n\n- In 2D cross-section, the local “view factor” at P to the inner surface is proportional to this projected angular measure.

Problem Analysis\n- Model: A planar stick figure built from uniform slender rods (negligible thickness) of mass per unit length λ, hinged at joints. The torso and arms have length l; each leg has length 1.2l. The head is a uniform sphere of radius r and mass m = 0.6 λ l. Angles: θ between each arm and the torso; φ between each leg and the extension of the torso line (acute angle).\n- Motion: The figure is in free fall (uniform gravity field ⇒ no net external torque about the whole-body center of mass, CM). Arms are actively driven relative to the torso with small amplitude θ0 and angular frequency ω. The legs are passive (their joints transmit forces but not couples/torques), and they oscillate near φ = π/4.\n- Task: Find the steady-state amplitude of the leg oscillations (“resonance amplitude”) caused by the upper-body actuation, starting from the initial configuration θ = π/2, φ = π/4. The figure can generate a couple at the shoulders (for the arms) but not at the hips (for the legs).\n\n2. Approach\n- Key physical insight 1 (whole-body angular momentum): In a uniform gravitational field, the net external torque about the whole-body CM is zero. Therefore the total angular momentum about the CM is conserved. The actively driven arm motion must be balanced by a counter-rotation of the “upper body” (torso + head, treated as a rigid assembly), leading to a relation ψ̇ = −κ θ̇ between the absolute torso rotation ψ(t) and the prescribed arm swing θ(t).\n- Key physical insight 2 (passive leg dynamics at a torque-free hip): Because the hip joint transmits no couple, the leg’s equation of motion can be derived by writing Lagrange’s equations (or angular momentum balance) about the accelerating hip. The only “forcing” on the leg is the linear acceleration of the hip aHip(t), which generates an effective torque about the hip equal to rCM × m aHip. In the small-angle regime near φ = π/4, the leg’s response is purely inertial and, in free fall, has no intrinsic natural frequency; the steady-state amplitude is frequency independent (no true resonance). The oscillation amplitude is thus determined kinematically by the base rotation ψ(t) and geometry.\n\nComputation outline:\n- Stage A: Compute κ by modeling the upper body (UB = torso + head) inertia and the arms’ contribution to angular momentum.\n- Stage B: Use the resulting ψ(t) to determine the hip’s linear acceleration. Write and solve the leg’s small-angle equation about φ0 = π/4 to extract the oscillation amplitude.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n3.1. Masses and lengths\n- Torso (uniform rod length l): mT = λ l.\n- Each arm (uniform rod length l): mA = λ l.\n- Each leg (uniform rod length 1.2 l): mL = λ (1.2 l) = 1.2 λ l.\n- Head (uniform sphere): mH = 0.6 λ l.\n\n3.2. Stage A: Whole-body angular momentum balance and the base rotation ψ(t)\n- Arm actuation: θ(t) = θ0 sin(ω t), small amplitude. The arms swing symmetrically; to leading order their centers and the UB CM shifts are symmetric, so first-order horizontal CM shifts cancel.\n- About the UB CM, the arms’ relative angular momentum contribution is approximately\n  Harms ≈ 2 Iarm,sh θ̇, with Iarm,sh = (1/3) mA l^2 = (1/3) (λ l) l^2 = (1/3) λ l^3.\n  Thus 2 Iarm,sh = (2/3) λ l^3.\n- Let IUB denote the UB inertia about its own CM (axis perpendicular to the plane). The UB consists of torso + head. We take the torso as a uniform rod, the head as a sphere whose self-inertia about its center can be included but is often small if r ≪ l. We keep it for completeness.\n\nLocate the UB CM (measured up from the hip along the torso line):\n  yUB = [mT (l/2) + mH (l + r)] / (mT + mH)\n       = [ (λ l)(l/2) + (0.6 λ l)(l + r) ] / [ (1.6 λ l) ]\n       = l [ 0.5 + 0.6 (1 + r/l) ] / 1.6\n       = l [ 0.6875 + 0.375 (r/l) ].\n\nDistances from UB CM needed for the parallel-axis theorem:\n  dT = yUB − (l/2),  dH = (l + r) − yUB.\n\nUB inertia about UB CM:\n  IT = (1/12) mT l^2 + mT dT^2 = (1/12)(λ l) l^2 + (λ l) dT^2,\n  IH = (2/5) mH r^2 + mH dH^2 = (2/5)(0.6 λ l) r^2 + (0.6 λ l) dH^2,\n  IUB = IT + IH\n      = λ l^3 [ 1/12 + (dT/l)^2 + 0.6 ( (2/5)(r/l)^2 + (dH/l)^2 ) ].\n\nInsert dT/l and dH/l explicitly using yUB/l = 0.6875 + 0.375 (r/l):\n  dT/l = (0.6875 + 0.375 ρ) − 0.5 = 0.1875 + 0.375 ρ,\n  dH/l = 1 + ρ − (0.6875 + 0.375 ρ) = 0.3125 + 0.625 ρ,\n  where ρ ≡ r/l.\n\nHence\n  IUB = λ l^3 [ 1/12 + (0.1875 + 0.375 ρ)^2 + 0.6 ( (2/5) ρ^2 + (0.3125 + 0.625 ρ)^2 ) ].\n\nAngular-momentum conservation about the whole-body CM (no external torque in a uniform gravitational field) gives, to leading order in small angles,\n  IUB ψ̇ + 2 Iarm,sh θ̇ ≈ 0,\nso\n  ψ̇(t) = −κ θ̇(t), with κ = 2 Iarm,sh / IUB = ( (2/3) λ l^3 ) / IUB.\n\nIntegrating with ψ(0) = 0 and θ(0) = 0,\n  ψ(t) = −κ θ(t) = −κ θ0 sin(ω t).\n\nNumerical simplification when r ≪ l (often realistic):\n- Using ρ → 0, one finds IUB ≈ λ l^3 [ 1/12 + (0.1875)^2 + 0.6 (0 + (0.3125)^2 ) ]\n                 ≈ λ l^3 (0.0833333 + 0.0351563 + 0.0585938) ≈ 0.1770833 λ l^3,\n  so κ ≈ (2/3)/0.1770833 ≈ 3.7647.\nWe keep the general form with r for completeness but may quote this number for intuition.\n\n3.3. Stage B: Passive leg dynamics driven by the hip linear acceleration\nLet L = 1.2 l be the leg length and consider one leg; the two legs behave symmetrically. Let the absolute leg angle be α(t) (in the plane), with α = ψ + φ for small angles near the initial φ0 = π/4. The hip point is fixed on the torso at a distance yUB below the UB CM along the torso line. Because the hip transmits no couple, the leg’s equation of motion can be derived from Lagrange’s equation with generalized coordinate α and with the hip’s translation vHip(t), aHip(t) injected parametrically.\n\nFor a uniform slender rod leg hinged at one end:\n- Mass: mL = 1.2 λ l,\n- Inertia about hip: Ihip = (1/3) mL L^2.\n\nUsing the standard kinetic-energy derivation (or angular-momentum balance about a moving point), one obtains the exact small-angle equation (planar motion):\n  Ihip α̈ + mL (L/2) [aHip · t̂(α)] = 0,\nwhere t̂(α) is the unit vector perpendicular to the leg along its positive rotation direction. In free fall, gravity produces no net torque relative to the accelerating hip; the only torque that remains is due to the hip’s linear acceleration aHip(t).\n\nThe hip acceleration due to the UB rotation about its CM is (neglecting O(ψ̇^2) terms for small angles):\n  aHip(t) ≈ − yUB ψ̈(t) t̂(ψ),\ni.e., along the torso’s local transverse direction. Therefore\n  aHip · t̂(α) = − yUB ψ̈(t) [t̂(ψ) · t̂(α)] = − yUB ψ̈(t) cos(α − ψ).\n\nLinearize for small oscillations near φ0 = π/4 (so α − ψ ≈ φ ≈ φ0), replace cos(α − ψ) ≈ cos φ0 = 1/√2, to obtain\n  Ihip α̈ − mL (L/2) yUB (1/√2) ψ̈(t) ≈ 0,\nhence\n  α̈ = c ψ̈(t), with c = [ mL (L/2) yUB / Ihip ] (1/√2) = (3 yUB)/(2 √2 L).\n\nIntegrating twice with initial conditions α(0) = ψ(0) + φ0, α̇(0) = ψ̇(0) + 0 and with ψ(0) = ψ̇(0) = 0 (start from rest), the integration constants vanish and\n  α(t) = c ψ(t) + φ0,\nso the relative leg angle is\n  φ(t) = α(t) − ψ(t) = φ0 + (c − 1) ψ(t)\n       = φ0 − (1 − c) κ θ0 sin(ω t).\n\nThus the steady-state small-amplitude oscillation of φ at frequency ω has amplitude\n  Aφ = |1 − c| |ψ|amp = |1 − c| κ θ0,\n\nwith\n  c = (3 yUB)/(2 √2 L),  yUB = [mT (l/2) + mH (l + r)] / (mT + mH),  L = 1.2 l,\n  κ = (2/3 λ l^3) / IUB,  IUB given in Section 3.2.\n\nRemarks:\n- Because the passive hip transmits no couple and the system is in free fall, the leg has no intrinsic restoring torque (no natural frequency). Consequently, the amplitude Aφ is independent of ω in this small-angle, leading-order treatment; there is no true resonance peak. The phrase “amplitude of resonance” here reduces to the steady-state amplitude under harmonic base actuation.\n- The forcing is inertial: proportional to ψ̈, but the solution α = c ψ shows that φ follows ψ linearly with a frequency-independent gain.\n\n3.4. Compact final expression and a practical numerical estimate\nCompact general expression:\n- yUB = [ (λ l)(l/2) + (0.6 λ l)(l + r) ] / (1.6 λ l) = l [ 0.6875 + 0.375 (r/l) ],\n- L = 1.2 l,\n- c = (3 yUB)/(2 √2 L) = (3/(2 √2)) [ yUB / (1.2 l) ],\n- IUB = λ l^3 [ 1/12 + (0.1875 + 0.375 ρ)^2 + 0.6 ( (2/5) ρ^2 + (0.3125 + 0.625 ρ)^2 ) ], with ρ = r/l,\n- κ = (2/3)/[ 1/12 + (0.1875 + 0.375 ρ)^2 + 0.6 ( (2/5) ρ^2 + (0.3125 + 0.625 ρ)^2 ) ].\n\nSteady-state amplitude of the leg oscillation about φ0 = π/4:\n  Aφ = |1 − c| κ θ0,  with c as above.\n\nIf r ≪ l (head’s radius much smaller than segment lengths), a useful numerical estimate is\n- yUB ≈ 0.6875 l,  L = 1.2 l ⇒ c ≈ (3/(2 √2)) (0.6875/1.2) ≈ 0.607,\n- κ ≈ 3.765,\nso\n  Aφ ≈ (1 − 0.607) × 3.765 × θ0 ≈ 1.48 θ0.\n\nThus the passive legs swing with an amplitude about 1.5 times the arm-drive amplitude θ0, at the same frequency and with a phase shift given by the sign of (c − 1).\n\n4. Final Answer\n- The driven torso rotation is ψ(t) = −κ θ0 sin(ω t), with\n  κ = (2/3)/[ 1/12 + (0.1875 + 0.375 r/l)^2 + 0.6 ( (2/5) (r/l)^2 + (0.3125 + 0.625 r/l)^2 ) ].\n- The steady-state leg oscillation about φ0 = π/4 has amplitude\n  Aφ = |1 − c| κ θ0, where c = (3 yUB)/(2 √2 L),\n  yUB = l [ 0.6875 + 0.375 (r/l) ],  L = 1.2 l.\n\nNumerically (if r ≪ l): Aφ ≈ 1.48 θ0, independent of ω to leading order.

Approach\n- Use an adiabatic, constant-volume energy balance for a reacting ideal-gas mixture.\n- Relate reaction internal energy change to the given enthalpy change using ΔU_rxn = ΔH_rxn − Δν R T, where Δν is the change in total moles per stoichiometric mole of ethanol reacted. For this reaction, Δν = 5 − 4 = +1.\n- Compute the final mixture composition to obtain the total constant-volume heat capacity Cv,tot of the final gases. With no vibrational DOFs, molar heat capacities are:\n  - c_v(O2) = c_v(N2) = c_v(CO2) = (5/2) R (linear molecules)\n  - c_v(H2O) = 3 R (nonlinear molecule)\n- Solve the energy balance for T1, then use the ideal-gas relation at constant volume, P ∝ nT, noting the total moles increase by Δν per ethanol reacted, to obtain P1.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\n3.1 Composition bookkeeping and stoichiometry\n- Let the initial total moles be n0.\n  - Ethanol: n_E,0 = α n0\n  - Air: n_air,0 = (1 − α) n0, with O2 mole fraction x and N2 fraction (1−x). (We will see the final formula does not depend on x, provided O2 remains in excess.)\n- Reaction stoichiometry per mole of ethanol:\n  C2H5OH + 3 O2 → 3 H2O + 2 CO2\n- Extent of reaction: ξ = α n0 (ethanol fully consumed).\n- Final moles:\n  - Ethanol: 0\n  - O2: n_O2,f = x(1−α) n0 − 3 α n0\n  - N2: n_N2,f = (1−x)(1−α) n0\n  - CO2: n_CO2,f = 2 α n0\n  - H2O: n_H2O,f = 3 α n0\n- Total final moles:\n  n_f = n_O2,f + n_N2,f + n_CO2,f + n_H2O,f\n      = [x(1−α) − 3α + (1−x)(1−α) + 2α + 3α] n0\n      = (1 − α − 3α + 5α) n0 = (1 + α) n0\n  Thus n_f/n0 = 1 + α, consistent with Δν = +1 per mole ethanol reacted.\n- O2 excess constraint (to have air remaining): n_O2,f ≥ 0 ⇒ x(1−α) − 3α ≥ 0 ⇒ α ≤ x/(3 + x). For dry air, x ≈ 0.21 gives α ≤ ≈ 0.065.\n\n3.2 Heat capacities with no vibrational modes\n- With vibrational DOFs unexcited:\n  c_v(O2) = c_v(N2) = c_v(CO2) = (5/2) R, c_v(H2O) = 3 R.\n- Total constant-volume heat capacity of the final mixture:\n  Σ n_i c_v,i\n  = (5/2)R [n_O2,f + n_N2,f + n_CO2,f] + 3R n_H2O,f\n  = (5/2)R [(1 − 2α) n0] + 3R (3α n0)\n  = R n0 [(5/2)(1 − 2α) + 9α]\n  = R n0 [(5/2) + 4α]\n  Remarkably, this is independent of the O2 fraction x (as long as O2 remains in excess).\n\n3.3 Reaction internal energy change at T0\n- For ideal gases, ΔH_rxn(T) and ΔU_rxn(T) are related by\n  ΔH_rxn(T) = ΔU_rxn(T) + Δν R T,\n  so ΔU_rxn(T) = ΔH_rxn(T) − Δν R T.\n- Given at T0: ΔH_rxn(T0) = −λ and Δν = +1, thus\n  ΔU_rxn(T0) = −λ − R T0\n  per mole of ethanol.\n\n3.4 Adiabatic constant-volume energy balance to solve for T1\n- For an adiabatic, constant-volume reactor with temperature-independent c_v (valid here), the exact energy balance can be written as\n  0 = ΔU_total = Σ_i n_i(final) c_v,i (T1 − T0) + ξ ΔU_rxn(T0),\n  where ξ = α n0 is the extent of reaction.\n- Substitute the expressions derived above:\n  [R n0 ((5/2) + 4α)] (T1 − T0) + (α n0)(−λ − R T0) = 0\n  ⇒ R n0 ((5/2) + 4α) (T1 − T0) = α n0 (λ + R T0)\n  ⇒ T1 − T0 = α (λ + R T0) / [R ((5/2) + 4α)]\n  ⇒ T1 = T0 + α (λ + R T0) / [R ((5/2) + 4α)]\n\nIt is sometimes useful to present the temperature rise in dimensionless form:\nT1/T0 = 1 + [α/(5/2 + 4α)] [1 + λ/(R T0)].\n\n3.5 Final pressure at constant volume\n- Ideal gas in a fixed volume: P ∝ n T. Therefore,\n  P1/P0 = (n_f/n0) (T1/T0) = (1 + α) (T1/T0).\n- Using the expression for T1/T0:\n  P1/P0 = (1 + α) [1 + (α/(5/2 + 4α)) (1 + λ/(R T0))].\n- Hence the final pressure is\n  P1 = (1 + α) [1 + (α/(5/2 + 4α)) (1 + λ/(R T0))] P0.\n\n3.6 Checks and limiting behavior\n- Small-α expansion (α ≪ 1):\n  P1/P0 ≈ 1 + α + (2/5) α [1 + λ/(R T0)] > 1,\n  reflecting both the mole increase (Δν = +1) and heating by the exothermic reaction.\n- Consistency: As α → 0, P1 → P0.\n- Constraint: The formula holds under the stated assumptions and provided α ≤ x/(3 + x) so that O2 remains in excess (air remaining).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,P_{1} \\;=\\; (1+\\alpha)\\left[\\,1+\\frac{\\alpha}{\\frac{5}{2}+4\\alpha}\\left(1+\\frac{\\lambda}{R\\,T_{0}}\\right)\\right] P_{0}\\,} \\]"}

Its line of action intersects the attachment line at a point x_int given (to first order) by\n  x_int = x_cm + (h/g) a_cm,\n  where h is the fixed vertical distance from the attachment line to the assembly’s CM; x_cm and a_cm are the CM’s horizontal position and acceleration.\n- Show that x_int is a linear functional of the state q = [x; u], namely x_int = w^T q for a computable vector w.\n- At fixed total energy E0 in the linear regime, maximize |x_int| over all phases and partitions of energy between the two linear modes. A standard quadratic-form/Cauchy–Schwarz argument yields\n  max |x_int| = sqrt(2 E0 w^T K^{-1} w).\n- Zero tension occurs when |x_int| = d/2, so d_max = 2 max |x_int|.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Geometry and the CM height h\n- The attachment line is the diameter of the semicircle (the line joining the arc’s endpoints).\n- For a uniform semicircular wire (mass m), the centroid lies a distance 2R/π below the diameter (along the symmetry axis).\n- The ball (mass m) at the bottom is R below the diameter.\n- Hence the combined center of mass of the wire (m) and the ball (m) is a distance\n  h = (m·2R/π + m·R)/(m + m) = (R/2) (1 + 2/π)\n  below the attachment line.\n\nStep 2: Generalized coordinates and small-oscillation model\n- Let q = [x; u], with\n  - x: horizontal translation shared by wire and ball,\n  - u: ball’s small horizontal motion along the tangent at the bottom (equal to arc-length to first order).\n- Kinetic energy:\n  - Wire (mass m): v = ẋ\n  - Ball (mass m): v = ẋ + u̇\n  T = 1/2 m ẋ^2 + 1/2 m (ẋ + u̇)^2\n    = 1/2 [ẋ u̇] m [[2, 1], [1, 1]] [ẋ; u̇].\n  Thus M = m [[2, 1], [1, 1]].\n- Potential energy (small angles):\n  - Horizontal sway by x lifts the assembly like a parallel pendulum of length L with total mass 2m: V_sway = (2m g)/(2L) x^2 = (m g/L) x^2.\n  - Ball on the semicircle has height increase ≈ u^2/(2R): V_ball = (m g)/(2R) u^2.\n  Therefore V = 1/2 q^T K q with K = m g diag(2/L, 1/R).\n- Linear equations of motion: q̈ = −M^{-1} K q.\n\nStep 3: Resultant line-of-action and zero-tension criterion\n- For the lower assembly, the two string tensions are equivalent to a single resultant force F_T whose line of action intersects the attachment line at position x_int. Using d’Alembert’s principle, the external forces “felt” by the assembly are gravity −(2m) g ĵ and inertial −(2m) a_cm î (to leading order, vertical CM acceleration is second order and neglected), where the total mass is 2m and a_cm is the horizontal CM acceleration.\n- The moment balance about the intersection point gives the relation\n  x_int = x_cm + (h/g) a_cm,\n  where x_cm is the horizontal CM position relative to the midline of the attachment line.\n- With our coordinates, \n  x_cm = (m x + m(x + u)) / (2m) = x + u/2,\n  a_cm = ẍ + ü/2.\n- Using q̈ = −M^{-1} K q, we get\n  x_int = e^T q − (h/g) e^T M^{-1} K q = w^T q,\n  where e = [1; 1/2] and\n  w = e − (h/g) M^{-1} K e.\n\nStep 4: Compute w\n- First compute M^{-1} and K e:\n  M = m [[2, 1], [1, 1]], so [[2,1],[1,1]]^{-1} = [[1, −1], [−1, 2]] (determinant 1). Thus M^{-1} = (1/m) [[1, −1], [−1, 2]].\n  K e = diag(2 m g/L, m g/R) [1; 1/2] = [2 m g/L; m g/(2R)].\n  Hence\n  M^{-1} K e = (1/m) [[1, −1], [−1, 2]] [2 m g/L; m g/(2R)]\n              = [ 2g/L − g/(2R); −2g/L + g/R ].\n- Therefore\n  w = e − (h/g) M^{-1} K e\n    = [1 − h(2/L − 1/(2R)); 1/2 + h(2/L − 1/R)].\n\nStep 5: Maximize |x_int| at fixed energy E0\n- The total energy is E = 1/2 q̇^T M q̇ + 1/2 q^T K q. For a given E0, the maximum of the linear functional w^T q occurs at a turning point (q̇ = 0), under the quadratic constraint q^T K q ≤ 2 E0.\n- By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality in the K-inner product,\n  max_{q^T K q ≤ 2E0} w^T q = sqrt(2 E0 w^T K^{-1} w).\n- Because zero tension occurs when |x_int| = d/2, the largest d that can be reached is\n  d_max = 2 max |x_int| = 2 sqrt(2 E0 w^T K^{-1} w).\n- With K^{-1} = (1/(m g)) diag(L/2, R), we obtain\n  w^T K^{-1} w = (1/(m g)) [ (L/2) w_1^2 + R w_2^2 ],\n  where\n  w_1 = 1 − h(2/L − 1/(2R)),  w_2 = 1/2 + h(2/L − 1/R).\n- Therefore\n  d_max = 2 sqrt{ (2 E0)/(m g) [ (L/2) (1 − h(2/L − 1/(2R)))^2 + R (1/2 + h(2/L − 1/R))^2 ] }.\n\nStep 6: Substitute h\n- The CM offset is h = (R/2)(1 + 2/π).\n- You may keep h symbolic (clearer) or expand:\n  w_1 = 1 − h(2/L − 1/(2R)),\n  w_2 = 1/2 + h(2/L − 1/R),\n  with h = (R/2)(1 + 2/π).\n\nStep 7: Checks and remarks\n- Restricting the internal motion u to zero (ball stuck at the bottom) gives a one-DOF sway with ẍ = −(g/L) x. Then x_int = x + (h/g) ẍ = x(1 − h/L). At fixed E0, x_max = sqrt(E0 L/(m g)), so the restricted bound is\n  d_max,trans = 2 |1 − h/L| sqrt(E0 L/(m g)),\n  which is not larger than the full two-DOF result above. Allowing the internal ball motion (proper phasing between x and u) can only increase the attainable skew of the resultant and thus increase d_max.\n- Validity: small-oscillation approximation requires |x|/L ≪ 1 and |u|/R ≪ 1 at the maximizing configuration, which is ensured if E0 is sufficiently small compared to m g times the relevant lengths.\n\n4) Final Answer\nThe maximum ceiling separation for which one string can go slack at some instant in the small-oscillation motion, given total energy E0 and masses m (wire) and m (ball), is\n\nd_max = 2 sqrt{ (2 E0)/(m g) [ (L/2) (1 − h(2/L − 1/(2R)))^2 + R (1/2 + h(2/L − 1/R))^2 ] },\n\nwith the geometric constant\nh = (R/2) (1 + 2/π),\nthe vertical distance from the attachment line to the combined center of mass of the semicircular wire plus the ball.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,d_{\\max}\n= 2\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{2E_0}{m g}\\left[\n\\frac{L}{2}\\Big(1 - h\\Big(\\frac{2}{L}-\\frac{1}{2R}\\Big)\\Big)^{\\!2}\n+ R\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} + h\\Big(\\frac{2}{L}-\\frac{1}{R}\\Big)\\Big)^{\\!2}\\right]}\\,,\n\\quad h=\\frac{R}{2}\\Big(1+\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\Big)\\,}\n\\]"}

Geometry is fixed by d − R < L < sqrt(d^2 − R^2).\n- Initially, the plane containing O, P, and the rod is vertical. A small perturbation makes the assembly rotate about the horizontal axis as a single rigid body (no slip at the contact) until, at a rotation angle φ, impending slip at the contact occurs.\n- Goal: Find the static friction coefficient μ at the contact as a function of φ.\n\nKey point: Before slip, the rod and shell rotate together as a single one-degree-of-freedom system about the horizontal axis. The contact friction transmits torque between them but does no net work internally; the only external driving torque about the axis is gravity acting on the rod’s center of mass.\n\n2) Approach\n- Close the geometry of the triangle HOP (hinge–center–contact) to get fixed angles and perpendicular distances to the axis.\n- About the rotation axis (the horizontal line through O and H), write the dynamics of the composite system:\n  • Total inertia I_tot about the axis (sum of shell and rod contributions).\n  • Angular acceleration α(φ) follows from the gravitational torque of the rod’s weight about the axis.\n  • Angular speed ω(φ) from energy (no slip ⇒ one DOF).\n- The tangential friction force F_t at the contact follows immediately from the shell’s torque balance about the axis: only friction produces a torque on the shell (the normal goes through O).\n- To determine the normal reaction N at the contact, analyze the rod alone with an angular-momentum (moment) balance about the hinge H with axis perpendicular to the motion plane. This eliminates the unknown hinge forces and expresses N in terms of known kinematics (α, ω), geometry, and F_t.\n- The friction coefficient at impending slip is μ(φ) = |F_t(φ)|/N(φ).\n\nThis combines two complementary insights:\n- Treating the assembly about the main axis cleanly gives α(φ), ω(φ), and F_t(φ) without any contact/hinge forces.\n- A moment balance about the hinge (perpendicular to the plane) extracts N(φ) without solving for hinge reactions.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep A. Geometry and kinematics in the plane HOP\n- Triangle HOP has sides HO = d, OP = R, HP = L. Define:\n  • θ = ∠HOP (at O). By the law of cosines:\n    cos θ = (d^2 + R^2 − L^2) / (2 d R), with 0 < θ < π/2 by the given bounds on L.\n  • β = ∠HPO (at P). By the law of cosines:\n    cos β = (L^2 + R^2 − d^2) / (2 L R), and also sin β = (d/L) sin θ (from area relations).\n- Perpendicular distances to the rotation axis (the horizontal line through H and O):\n  • For the contact point P: ρ_P = R sin θ.\n  • For the rod’s center of mass (midpoint of HP): ρ_cm = ρ_P/2 = (R/2) sin θ.\n\nStep B. Moments of inertia about the horizontal axis (through O and H)\n- Thin spherical shell about a diameter: I_s = (2/3) M R^2.\n- Slender rod about the same axis: since the distance from the axis grows linearly from 0 at H to ρ_P at P,\n  I_r = ∫_0^L (m/L) (ρ_P s/L)^2 ds = (1/3) m ρ_P^2 = (1/3) m R^2 sin^2 θ.\n- Total inertia: I_tot = I_s + I_r = (2/3) M R^2 + (1/3) m R^2 sin^2 θ.\n\nStep C. Rigid-body rotation of the assembly about the axis\n- The only external torque about the axis is gravity acting on the rod’s center of mass at the perpendicular distance ρ_cm. With the assembly rotated by angle φ from the initial vertical plane,\n  τ_g(φ) = m g ρ_cm sin φ.\n- Angular acceleration:\n  α(φ) = τ_g(φ)/I_tot = (m g ρ_cm / I_tot) sin φ.\n- From energy (ω = 0 at φ = 0),\n  (1/2) I_tot ω^2(φ) = m g ρ_cm [1 − cos φ]  ⇒  ω^2(φ) = 2 m g ρ_cm (1 − cos φ)/I_tot.\n\nStep D. Tangential friction force at contact\n- About the rotation axis, the shell’s torque is produced only by the tangential contact force F_t; the normal force passes through O and produces no torque:\n  F_t(φ) ρ_P = I_s α(φ).\n  Hence\n  F_t(φ) = (I_s α(φ))/ρ_P = (I_s m g ρ_cm /(I_tot ρ_P)) sin φ = (I_s m g /(2 I_tot)) sin φ,\n  since ρ_cm = ρ_P/2.\n\nStep E. Normal reaction N from a moment balance about the hinge H (perpendicular to plane)\n- Consider the rod alone and take torques about H along the axis perpendicular to the plane HOP. Hinge forces produce no moment about H. Let positive torque be defined by the right-hand rule out of the plane.\n- Geometry of moment arms:\n  • The normal N acts along OP, making an angle β with the rod HP, so its moment about H has magnitude N L sin β, sign chosen consistent with the diagram (we keep algebraic form below).\n  • The tangential force F_t at P is perpendicular to OP; the angle between F_t and HP is (π/2 − β), so its moment magnitude is F_t L cos β (sign as per orientation).\n  • The weight m g acts at the CM (midpoint of HP). Its in-plane moment about H is (L/2) m g sin(β − φ) (with sign depending on φ).\n- The rod’s in-plane “dynamic” moment about H equals (r_cm × m a_cm) projected perpendicular to the plane, where a_cm is the CM acceleration due to rigid rotation of the whole assembly about the main axis:\n  a_cm = −ω^2 ρ_cm e_ρ + α ρ_cm e_τ,\n  where e_ρ is the in-plane radial direction from the rotation axis to the CM and e_τ is the in-plane tangential direction (90 degrees ahead).\n  The component of a_cm perpendicular to the rod direction leads to the compact projection\n  (r_cm × m a_cm)_⊥ = (L/2) m [ −ω^2 ρ_cm sin(β − θ) + α ρ_cm cos(β − θ) ].\n- Angular-momentum balance about H (perpendicular to plane):\n  τ_N + τ_Ft + τ_g = (r_cm × m a_cm)_⊥.\n  Substituting the torques gives\n  N L sin β + F_t L cos β + (L/2) m g sin(β − φ)\n  = (L/2) m [ −ω^2 ρ_cm sin(β − θ) + α ρ_cm cos(β − θ) ].\n- Solve for N(φ):\n  N(φ) = −F_t(φ) cot β − (m/(2 sin β)) [ g sin(β − φ)\n            − ω^2(φ) ρ_cm sin(β − θ) + α(φ) ρ_cm cos(β − θ) ].\n\nInsert the expressions from Steps C and D:\n- ρ_cm = (R/2) sin θ, ρ_P = R sin θ, I_s = (2/3) M R^2, I_tot = (2/3) M R^2 + (1/3) m R^2 sin^2 θ.\n- α(φ) = (m g ρ_cm/I_tot) sin φ, ω^2(φ) = 2 m g ρ_cm(1 − cos φ)/I_tot.\n- F_t(φ) = (I_s m g /(2 I_tot)) sin φ.\n- θ and β as given in Step A.\n\nStep F. Static friction coefficient at impending slip\n- By definition at onset of slip, |F_t| = μ N.

Problem Analysis\n- Geometry: Two long, identical cylindrical electrodes (radius R), whose axes lie in the plane y = 0 (the interface between two semi-infinite electrolytes), are drilled along z through an electrolyte slab of thickness L (R, D ≪ L so end/fringe effects in z are negligible). The cylinder centers in the x–y cross-section are separated by 2D (D > R). One cylinder is connected to the positive terminal and the other to the negative terminal of a voltage source of emf U and internal resistance r0. Initially, the system is uncharged. At t = 0, the source is connected.\n- Media: Upper half-space y > 0 is electrolyte 1 with conductivity σ1 and permittivity ε1; lower half-space y < 0 is electrolyte 2 with conductivity σ2 and permittivity ε2.\n- Asked: The time-domain current i(t) delivered by the source.\n\n2. Approach\n- Quasi-static reduction: Because R, D ≪ L and frequencies are low (transient charging), fields are essentially uniform along z; the 3D problem reduces to a 2D cross-sectional electroquasistatic problem per unit length along z.\n- Two-wire geometry: In a homogeneous medium of complex parameter k = σ + sε (Laplace-domain s), the per-unit-length admittance of two parallel cylinders (radius R, center half-separation D) at potentials ±V/2 is Y′hom(s) = π k / arccosh(D/R).\n- Interface averaging: For the present geometry with the cylinder axes centered on the interface and symmetry across y=0, the field pattern |E| in each half-space is the same as in the homogeneous-geometry solution. Using the electroquasistatic power/energy identity, the total admittance equals the arithmetic average of replacing k by k1 and k2 in the same field map. Hence keff(s) = (k1 + k2)/2, with k1 = σ1 + sε1, k2 = σ2 + sε2, and\n  Y′(s) = π keff(s) / arccosh(D/R).\n- Lumped model: The total two-terminal admittance is Y(s) = L Y′(s) = G + sC with\n  G = L π (σ1 + σ2) / [2 arccosh(D/R)], C = L π (ε1 + ε2) / [2 arccosh(D/R)].\n  This is a parallel G‖C load driven by a Thevenin source U in series with r0.\n- Circuit transient: Solve (U − v)/r0 = G v + C dv/dt with v(0) = 0 (uncharged), then i(t) = (U − v)/r0. The response is single-pole with time constant τ = C/(G + 1/r0).\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Per-unit-length admittance in homogeneous medium\n- For two identical cylinders (radius R) with center separation 2D in a homogeneous medium of complex parameter k = σ + sε, the exact 2D electroquasistatic result (derivable via bipolar coordinates) is\n  Y′hom(s) = π k / γ, with γ ≡ arccosh(D/R) = ln[(D + √(D^2 − R^2))/R].\n  Thus G′hom = π σ/γ and C′hom = π ε/γ.\n\nStep 2: Extension to two half-spaces\n- Define k1 = σ1 + sε1 for y > 0 and k2 = σ2 + sε2 for y < 0.\n- Symmetry: With cylinder axes on the interface y = 0 and equal/opposite potentials, the solution of Laplace’s equation has mirror symmetry. The field magnitude |E(x,y)| in each half-space equals that of the homogeneous-geometry solution (same geometry factor γ), so the electroquasistatic power integral\n  Y′ V^2/2 = ∫(1/2) k |E|^2 dA\n  splits evenly into the two half-spaces with the same |E|^2 map, yielding\n  Y′(s) = [Y′hom(k1) + Y′hom(k2)]/2 = (π/γ) (k1 + k2)/2.\n- Therefore the total two-terminal admittance over length L is\n  Y(s) = L Y′(s) = G + sC,\n  with\n  G = L π (σ1 + σ2) / (2 γ),   C = L π (ε1 + ε2) / (2 γ),\n  where γ = arccosh(D/R) = ln[(D + √(D^2 − R^2))/R].\n  Units check: G in siemens (S), C in farads (F).\n\nStep 3: Transient circuit with source resistance\n- The load is a parallel G‖C.

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field.

This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2).

The field magnitude near the origin is specified as E0, and the permittivity is ε0.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use oblate spheroidal coordinates defined by\n  x = a cosh μ cos ν cos φ, y = a cosh μ cos ν sin φ, z = a sinh μ sin ν.\n- Impose that the electric field lines are the μ-curves by taking the potential V = V(μ) (so that E = −∇V is parallel to eμ).\n- Solve Laplace’s equation ∇²V = 0 in the charge-free regions z > 0 and z < 0, using the oblate spheroidal scale factors. This gives V′(μ) ∝ sech μ.\n- Fix the constants by requiring that near the origin the field is E ≈ E0 ẑ and that the potential is continuous across the plane z = 0 (pure surface charge, no dipole layer). This leads to opposite constants in the two half-spaces so that the normal field component flips sign across the plane.\n- Compute the normal field E_z just above and just below the plane, and use the boundary condition σ = ε0 (E_z^+ − E_z^−) to obtain the surface charge density on the disk in the plane.

Solution Steps\n3.1 Geometry and scale factors\n- Oblate spheroidal coordinates:\n  x = a cosh μ cos ν cos φ,\n  y = a cosh μ cos ν sin φ,\n  z = a sinh μ sin ν.\n- The scale factors are (standard result)\n  hμ = hν = a √(sinh² μ + sin² ν),  hφ = a cosh μ cos ν.\n- With V = V(μ), the gradient and Laplacian simplify to\n  ∇V = eμ (1/hμ) V′(μ),  E = −∇V = − eμ (1/hμ) V′(μ),\n  ∇²V = 1/(hμ hν hφ) ∂/∂μ[(hν hφ/hμ) V′(μ)].\n  Since hμ = hν, this becomes\n  ∇²V = 1/(hμ² hφ) d/dμ [hφ V′(μ)].\n\n3.2 Solving Laplace’s equation for V(μ)\n- Using hφ = a cosh μ cos ν and hμ² = a² (sinh² μ + sin² ν), we get\n  ∇²V = 1/[a² (sinh² μ + sin² ν) (a cosh μ cos ν)] d/dμ [a cosh μ cos ν V′(μ)]\n       = 1/[a² (sinh² μ + sin² ν) cosh μ] d/dμ [cosh μ V′(μ)].\n- For ∇²V = 0 to hold for all ν, we require\n  d/dμ [cosh μ V′(μ)] = 0  ⇒  cosh μ V′(μ) = C (constant),\n  so\n  V′(μ) = C sech μ.\n- Thus in each half-space (z > 0 and z < 0) we can choose\n  V′(μ) = C± sech μ, with possibly different constants C+ and C− above and below the plane.\n- One antiderivative is\n  V(μ) = C± ∫ sech μ dμ = C± arctan(sinh μ) + const.\n\n3.3 Fixing the constants from near-origin behavior and symmetry\n- The electric field is\n  E = −∇V = − eμ (1/hμ) V′(μ) = − eμ [C± sech μ / hμ].\n- Near the origin (ρ ≈ 0, z ≈ 0), we have μ → 0 and ν → π/2 (since ρ = a cosh μ cos ν, z = a sinh μ sin ν). In this limit:\n  sinh μ ≈ μ, cosh μ ≈ 1, hμ ≈ a, and sin ν ≈ 1.\n- The z-component can be computed without ambiguity using\n  eμ = (1/hμ) ∂r/∂μ, hence E = − (V′/hμ²) ∂r/∂μ and\n  E_z = − (V′/hμ²) ∂z/∂μ.\n- With z = a sinh μ sin ν, we have ∂z/∂μ = a cosh μ sin ν, so\n  E_z = − [C± sech μ / hμ²] a cosh μ sin ν = − C± a sin ν / hμ²\n      = − C± a sin ν / [a² (sinh² μ + sin² ν)].\n- For z > 0 near the origin (μ → 0, sin ν → 1), this yields\n  E_z → − C+ / a.\n  Matching E_z → + E0 fixes C+ = − a E0.\n- To represent a pure surface charge on z = 0 with no dipole layer, the potential should be continuous across the plane and the normal field should flip sign. This is achieved by choosing\n  C− = + a E0  in the lower half-space.\n- Thus,\n  V′(μ) = − a E0 sech μ   (z > 0),\n  V′(μ) = + a E0 sech μ   (z < 0),\n  and one convenient choice of potential (continuous at z = 0 since arctan(sinh 0) = 0) is\n  V(μ) = − a E0 arctan(sinh μ)  for z > 0,\n  V(μ) = + a E0 arctan(sinh μ)  for z < 0.\n\n3.4 The field and its normal component at the plane\n- With these constants, the z-component in each half-space is\n  E_z^+ = − C+ a sin ν / [a² (sinh² μ + sin² ν)] = E0 sin ν / [sinh² μ + sin² ν]  (z > 0),\n  E_z^− = − C− a sin ν / [a² (sinh² μ + sin² ν)] = − E0 sin ν / [sinh² μ + sin² ν] (z < 0).\n- The plane z = 0 is reached in two ways:\n  1) Inside the focal disk (ρ < a): z = 0 corresponds to μ = 0, with ρ = a cos ν (so cos ν = ρ/a) and sin ν = √(1 − (ρ/a)²). Taking μ → 0,\n     E_z^+(ρ) = E0 / sin ν = E0 / √(1 − (ρ/a)²),\n     E_z^−(ρ) = − E0 / sin ν = − E0 / √(1 − (ρ/a)²).\n  2) Outside the disk (ρ ≥ a): z = 0 corresponds to ν = 0 or ν = π, so sin ν = 0 and therefore E_z^± = 0.\n- Note at the plane inside the disk, ∂ρ/∂μ = a sinh μ cos ν → 0 as μ → 0, so the μ-curves cross the plane orthogonally there. Consequently, the field at the surface is purely normal inside the disk, consistent with having only surface charge and no surface currents or tangential discontinuity. Outside the disk, E_z vanishes on the plane (as expected from symmetry) and any tangential component is continuous, hence σ = 0 there.\n\n3.5 Surface charge density from the boundary condition\n- The electrostatic boundary condition for the normal component across a surface with surface charge density σ is\n  σ(ρ) = ε0 [E_z^+(ρ) − E_z^−(ρ)].\n- Therefore, using the results above,\n  For 0 ≤ ρ < a:\n  σ(ρ) = ε0 [E0 / √(1 − (ρ/a)²) − (− E0 / √(1 − (ρ/a)²))]\n        = 2 ε0 E0 / √(1 − (ρ/a)²).\n  For ρ ≥ a:\n  σ(ρ) = 0.\n- The total charge on the disk is finite:\n  Q = ∫ σ dS = ∫_0^{2π} ∫_0^a σ(ρ) ρ dρ dφ\n    = 2π ∫_0^a [2 ε0 E0 ρ / √(1 − (ρ/a)²)] dρ\n    = 4π ε0 E0 a².\n- The field is divergence-free in the charge-free regions, and the flux along each oblate-spheroidal μ-tube is constant, as can be seen from ∇·E = 0 and the derived V′(μ).\n\n4. Final Answer\n- The required surface charge distribution that generates the tubular μ-directed field (upward for z > 0) with field strength E0 near the origin is a charged circular disk of radius a in the plane z = 0, with surface charge density\n  σ(ρ) = 2 ε0 E0 / √(1 − (ρ/a)²) for 0 ≤ ρ < a,\n  and σ(ρ) = 0 for ρ ≥ a.\n- An explicit potential realizing this field is\n  V(μ) = − a E0 arctan(sinh μ) for z > 0,\n  V(μ) = + a E0 arctan(sinh μ) for z < 0,\n  which yields E = −∇V parallel to eμ everywhere, and reproduces the stated jump in E_z across the plane.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\sigma(\\rho) = \\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{2\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,E_{0}}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\rho/a)^{2}}}, & 0 \\le \\rho < a,\\\\[6pt]\n0, & \\rho \\ge a~,\n\\end{cases} } \\]"}

We are to find the frequency f of small oscillations of the ellipse’s center of mass about this equilibrium, assuming pure rolling without slip at all times.\n\nKey point: Because the outer circular cylinder is fixed, its mass M does not enter the dynamics (it contributes only a geometric constraint).\n\n2) Approach\n- Use a single generalized coordinate describing the small rocking motion about the bottom. A convenient choice is ψ, the angular coordinate of the contact point on the inner circle measured from the bottom (ψ = 0 at equilibrium). Let θ be the orientation angle of the ellipse (θ = 0 when the minor axis is vertical).

Its small-angle expansion yields how the center-to-center distance S between the two axes varies with δ.\n  2) Rolling without slip relates θ̇ and ψ̇ via the curvature at the contact (for the ellipse at its lower vertex the radius of curvature is ρ0 = a^2/b).\n- Build the Lagrangian to quadratic order: translational KE of the center, rotational KE about the center with I = m(a^2 + b^2)/4, and gravitational PE via the center height yC = −S(δ) cos ψ.\n- Linearize about ψ = 0, δ = 0 and use the rolling constraint to eliminate θ in favor of ψ, obtaining a 1-DOF SHO. The frequency follows from ω^2 = K/A, where A is the effective inertia and K the small-angle stiffness.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep A. Geometry at contact: support function and center-to-center distance\n- For an ellipse with semi-major axis a (horizontal at equilibrium) and semi-minor axis b (vertical at equilibrium), the distance from the center to the boundary along a normal making body-fixed angle δ (measured from the minor axis direction at the bottom) is the support function\n  h(δ) = sqrt(a^2 sin^2 δ + b^2 cos^2 δ).\n- The center-to-center distance between the centers of the two cylinders along the common normal is\n  S(δ) = R − h(δ).\n- For small δ, expand h(δ) about δ = 0:\n  h(δ) ≈ b + (a^2 − b^2) δ^2 / (2b).\n  Hence\n  S(δ) ≈ S0 − c δ^2, with S0 = R − b and c = (a^2 − b^2) / (2b).\n\nStep B. Local curvature at the bottom of the ellipse and rolling kinematics\n- The radius of curvature of an ellipse at the end of its minor axis is\n  ρ0 = a^2 / b.\n- For pure rolling without slipping between two smooth curves, the common normal at the contact remains aligned, and the element of arclength is the same on both sides: ds = R dψ (outer circle) = ρ0 dν (ellipse), where ν is the change of the contact normal along the ellipse relative to the body.\n- The spatial normal of the ellipse at the contact equals the body orientation θ plus ν; matching with the circle’s normal ψ gives\n  θ + ν = ψ  ⇒  δ ≡ ψ − θ = ν.\n- Therefore, at the bottom where ρ ≈ ρ0,\n  dδ = ds/ρ0 = (R/ρ0) dψ  ⇒  δ ≈ (R/ρ0) ψ (to linear order).\n- From θ = ψ − δ we also have the linear kinematic relation\n  θ̇ = (1 − R/ρ0) ψ̇.\n  Define λ = 1 − R/ρ0.\n\nStep C.

To quadratic order, we can take S ≈ S0 in the kinetic energy (variations of S contribute only higher-order terms), so\n  T_trans ≈ (1/2) m (S0 ψ̇)^2 = (1/2) m S0^2 ψ̇^2.\n- Rotational kinetic energy about the center:\n  The moment of inertia of a homogeneous elliptic cylinder (about its central axis normal to the cross-section) is\n  I = m (a^2 + b^2) / 4.\n  Using θ̇ = λ ψ̇,\n  T_rot = (1/2) I θ̇^2 = (1/2) I λ^2 ψ̇^2.\n- Gravitational potential energy:\n  With the circle center as origin and upward y positive, the ellipse center has height\n  yC = −S(δ) cos ψ.\n  Expand to quadratic order:\n  cos ψ ≈ 1 − ψ^2/2, and S(δ) ≈ S0 − c δ^2 with c = (a^2 − b^2)/(2b).\n  Thus\n  yC ≈ −S0 (1 − ψ^2/2) + c δ^2.\n  Discarding the constant −S0 (it does not affect dynamics),\n  V ≈ m g [ (S0/2) ψ^2 + c δ^2 ].\n  Using δ ≈ (R/ρ0) ψ,\n  V ≈ (1/2) m g [ S0 + (a^2 − b^2)/b (R/ρ0)^2 ] ψ^2.\n\nStep D.

This fixes the collision angle θc.\n- Collision model: Over the short impact time, impulses act at the contact point; gravity is negligible during the impact.

At the instant of impact:\n- A is at angle θc with angular speed ωA− just before impact.\n- B is vertical with ωB− = 0.\n\nBecause B is vertical at impact, the contact force is horizontal.

The horizontal velocity at the tip of A is vAx = −ωA+ h cos θc; at height s on B it is vBx = −ωB+ h cos θc.

Problem Analysis\n- We have four infinitely long, uniformly charged lines parallel to the z-axis, placed at (±a, 0) with +λ and at (0, ±a) with −λ. The ion (mass m, positive charge q) is confined to move in the xy-plane near the origin.\n- The four lines are rotated as a rigid set about the z-axis at angular speed Ω (counterclockwise). The electric field pattern therefore rotates at Ω in the lab frame.\n- We are asked for the minimum Ω (denoted Ω_min) that yields a stable equilibrium of the ion near the origin.\n\nKey idea: The static quadrupole field from the four lines forms a saddle potential (unstable in at least one direction). A uniform rotation of this saddle can dynamically stabilize the motion (rotating saddle trap), provided Ω is sufficiently large. We determine Ω_min by linearizing the field near the origin and analyzing the dynamics in the rotating frame.\n\n2. Approach\n- Determine the linearized electric field near the origin due to the four line charges. By symmetry, the field vanishes at the origin, but its spatial derivative (curvature) does not; the resulting field is quadrupolar: E ≈ (−K x, +K y).\n- Transform to a frame rotating with angular speed Ω about ẑ. In that frame, the quadrupole field is stationary, and inertial forces appear: Coriolis (−2m Ω × v) and centrifugal (+m Ω^2 r).\n- Write the linear equations of motion in the rotating frame, seek exponential solutions e^{s t}, and impose the condition that all eigenvalues have purely imaginary s (i.e., s^2 < 0) for stability.\n- Solve for the threshold Ω where stability is achieved. Express Ω_min in terms of λ, a, q, m, and ε0.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Linearized electric field near the origin\n- The electric field from a single infinite line charge (along z) located at r0 = (x0, y0) in the xy-plane is\nE(r) = (λ_s / (2π ε0)) (r − r0) / |r − r0|^2\nwhere λ_s is the signed line density: +λ for the lines at (±a, 0), and −λ for the lines at (0, ±a).\n\n- Linearize E about r = 0. The Jacobian (derivative) of E with respect to r at r = 0 for one line at r0 with signed density λ_s is\nJ(r0) = ∂E/∂r |_{r=0} = (λ_s / (2π ε0)) [ I/a^2 − 2 (r0 r0^T)/a^4 ]\nsince |r0| = a for all four lines.\n\n- Evaluate J for each line:\n  - For r0 = (±a, 0) with +λ: r0 r0^T = [[a^2, 0], [0, 0]] ⇒ J = (λ/(2π ε0 a^2)) diag(−1, +1).\n  - For r0 = (0, ±a) with −λ: r0 r0^T = [[0, 0], [0, a^2]], the extra − sign from λ_s yields the same J = (λ/(2π ε0 a^2)) diag(−1, +1).\n\n- Sum all four contributions:\nJ_total = 4 × (λ/(2π ε0 a^2)) diag(−1, +1) = (2λ/(π ε0 a^2)) diag(−1, +1).\n\n- Therefore, to leading order near the origin,\nE(x, y) ≈ J_total r = ( −K x, +K y ), with K = 2λ/(π ε0 a^2).\n\n- The corresponding electrostatic potential (choosing the given zero references for each line) near the origin is\nΦ(x, y) ≈ (K/2) (x^2 − y^2),\nsince E = −∇Φ gives E_x = −K x and E_y = +K y.\n\nDefine the electrostatic curvature frequency\nω_e^2 := (q/m) K = (q/m) (2λ/(π ε0 a^2)) = 2 q λ / (π ε0 m a^2).\n\nStep 2: Equations of motion in the rotating frame\n- Use a frame rotating at angular speed Ω about ẑ (same as the charge pattern). In this frame, the electric field is static (given above). The equations of motion include inertial forces:\nm r̈ = q E(r) − 2 m Ω × ṙ − m Ω × (Ω × r).\n\n- With r = (x, y, 0), Ω = Ω ẑ, −m Ω × (Ω × r) = + m Ω^2 r (since Ω·r = 0).\n- Components:\nm ẍ = q (−K x) + m Ω^2 x + 2 m Ω ẏ,\nm ÿ = q (+K y) + m Ω^2 y − 2 m Ω ẋ.\n\n- Using ω_e^2 = (q/m) K,\nẍ = −ω_e^2 x + Ω^2 x + 2 Ω ẏ,\nÿ = +ω_e^2 y + Ω^2 y − 2 Ω ẋ.\n\nStep 3: Stability analysis via normal modes\n- Seek solutions of the form x, y ∝ e^{s t}. Then\n(s^2 + ω_e^2 − Ω^2) x − 2 Ω s y = 0,\n2 Ω s x + (s^2 − ω_e^2 − Ω^2) y = 0.\n\n- Nontrivial solutions require the determinant to vanish:\n[(s^2 + ω_e^2 − Ω^2)(s^2 − ω_e^2 − Ω^2)] + (2 Ω s)^2 = 0.\n\n- Simplify:\n(s^2 + Ω^2)^2 − ω_e^4 = 0,\nso s^2 = −Ω^2 ± ω_e^2.\n\n- Stability (bounded motion) requires all s to be purely imaginary, i.e., both s^2 < 0. The “−” branch s^2 = −Ω^2 − ω_e^2 is always negative. The “+” branch gives s^2 = −Ω^2 + ω_e^2, which is negative only if\nΩ^2 > ω_e^2.\n\nThus the threshold angular speed is\nΩ_min = ω_e = sqrt(2 q λ / (π ε0 m a^2)).\n\n4. Physical interpretation\n- The electrostatic field near the origin is a saddle: restoring along x, anti-restoring along y. Static equilibrium is unstable.\n- Rotation introduces gyroscopic (Coriolis) coupling and an isotropic centrifugal term, converting the saddle into a dynamically stabilized trap when the rotation is sufficiently fast. This is the rotating-saddle mechanism analogous to RF quadrupole (Paul) traps.\n- The threshold Ω_min is set by the electrostatic curvature frequency ω_e determined by the local quadrupole strength and the ion’s charge-to-mass ratio.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\Omega_{\\min} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\,q\\,\\lambda}{\\pi\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,m\\,a^{2}}} } \\]"}

This means the added mass brings kinetic energy into the oscillator at the moment of accretion.\n- Goal: For small changes (order m/M), find the change in oscillation amplitude ΔA from the initial amplitude A0.\n\n2) Approach\nWe use a slow-variation (adiabatic) treatment with averaging over many oscillations:\n\n- Energy bookkeeping with slow parameter drift:\n  - The oscillator’s mechanical energy E(t) is related to the amplitude by E ≈ (1/2) k A^2 for a harmonic oscillator.\n  - Parameter drift in k changes the energy at the rate ⟨∂H/∂k⟩ k̇ = (1/2)⟨x^2⟩ k̇ = (A^2/4) k̇.\n  - Accretion of mass that is co-moving injects energy at a rate equal to the kinetic energy carried in by the added mass.\n- Kinematics along a uniform spring:\n  - For a light, uniform spring, the velocity along the spring is approximately linear in the coordinate y along its length: u(y,t) ≈ (y/L) ẋ_R(t), where x_R is the right-end displacement (block position).\n  - This implies both the standard “effective moving mass” of the spring m/3 and a simple expression for the energy brought in by uniformly added mass.\n- We then write and solve an averaged energy balance equation to obtain an evolution law for A(t), and integrate it for the small changes in k and m. We retain terms to first order in the small parameter m/M.\n\nWe also contrast this with the adiabatic invariant approach (I = E/ω constant) that would apply if mass were not injecting energy (e.g., if mass were added at rest and accelerated only by the oscillator). Under the stated co-moving assumption, however, there is net energy injection, and the amplitude change differs in sign from the pure adiabatic-invariant prediction for the mass term.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Dynamics and basic averages\n- Instantaneous energy of a harmonic oscillator with slowly varying amplitude A(t):\n  E(t) ≈ (1/2) k A^2(t).\n- For sinusoidal motion x(t) = A cos(ω t) with slowly varying A and k,\n  ⟨x^2⟩ = A^2/2,  ⟨ẋ^2⟩ = (1/2) ω^2 A^2.\n- The angular frequency (including the spring mass effect) is\n  ω^2 = k / (M + m/3).\n  Since m ≪ M, to first order we may use ω^2 ≈ k/M when it multiplies already small quantities; differences are O((m/M)^2) and can be neglected.\n\nStep 2: Power input due to stiffness drift\n- When k changes slowly, the average rate of change of energy due to the parameter k is\n  P_k = ⟨∂H/∂k⟩ k̇ = (1/2)⟨x^2⟩ k̇ = (A^2/4) k̇.\n\nStep 3: Power input due to co-moving mass accretion\n- Uniformly distributed mass addition at total rate ṁ, with local velocity u(y,t), carries in kinetic energy at rate\n  P_m,inst = ∫_0^L (1/2) u^2(y,t) dṁ(y) = (1/2) ṁ ⟨u^2(y,t)⟩_y,\n  where ⟨⋅⟩_y denotes the average along the length (uniform distribution).\n- Using u(y,t) = (y/L) ẋ_R(t), we have ⟨(y/L)^2⟩_y = ∫_0^L (y/L)^2 (dy/L) = 1/3.\n  Hence P_m,inst = (1/2) ṁ (1/3) ẋ_R^2 = (1/6) ṁ ẋ_R^2.\n- Averaging over one cycle: ⟨ẋ_R^2⟩_t = (1/2) ω^2 A^2, thus\n  ⟨P_m⟩ = (1/6) ṁ ⟨ẋ_R^2⟩ = (1/12) ω^2 A^2 ṁ.\n\nStep 4: Averaged energy balance and amplitude evolution\n- The energy stored in the oscillator E(t) = (1/2) k A^2 gives\n  Ė = (1/2) A^2 k̇ + k A Ȧ.\n- Averaged power inputs:\n  Ė = ⟨P_k⟩ + ⟨P_m⟩ = (A^2/4) k̇ + (1/12) ω^2 A^2 ṁ.\n- Equate and solve for Ȧ/A:\n  (1/2) A^2 k̇ + k A Ȧ = (A^2/4) k̇ + (1/12) ω^2 A^2 ṁ\n  ⇒ k A Ȧ = −(1/4) A^2 k̇ + (1/12) ω^2 A^2 ṁ\n  ⇒ Ȧ/A = −(1/4)(k̇/k) + (1/12)(ω^2/k) ṁ.\n- Using ω^2 = k/(M + m/3) and m ≪ M:\n  ω^2/k ≈ 1/M, so\n  Ȧ/A ≈ −(1/4)(k̇/k) + (1/12M) ṁ.\n\nStep 5: Integrate over the slow change\n- Integrate from initial to final states:\n  Δ ln A = −(1/4) Δ ln k + (1/12M) Δm.\n- The changes given in the problem are small (order m/M):\n  Δk/k = −γ2 (m/M),\n  Δm = (γ1 − 1) m.\n- For small changes, Δ ln A ≈ ΔA/A0.

That would produce the opposite sign for the mass term. The present problem explicitly assumes co-moving accretion, so the energy-injection result derived above applies.\n\n4) Final Answer\nThe first-order change in amplitude due to the small softening of the spring and uniform co-moving mass accretion is\n\nΔA = A0 (m/M) [ γ2/4 + (γ1 − 1)/12 ].\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\Delta A \\;=\\; A_0\\,\\frac{m}{M}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_2}{4}+\\frac{\\gamma_1-1}{12}\\right) } \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We have a long, uniform solid prism with a regular N-gon cross-section (circumradius l), resting on a horizontal table. Its axis is horizontal (pointing forward), so the motion of interest is rotation about this axis (through the prism’s center, perpendicular to the cross-section).\n- A constant horizontal force F is applied at the center of mass (CM), perpendicular to the prism’s axis. The force is large enough to start rotation. With sufficiently large static friction, the prism rolls without slipping about the instantaneous ground-contact vertex between collisions.\n- As the prism tips from one vertex to the next, it experiences perfectly inelastic impacts with the table at each new vertex. After many steps, the post-impact angular speed becomes constant. We are to find that steady post-impact angular speed Ω.\n\n2. Approach\n- Geometry and stepping: Between two successive impacts, the prism pivots about the current contact vertex through an angle Δφ = 2π/N (the exterior angle), until the next vertex touches down. In that step the CM advances horizontally by Δx = 2 l sin(π/N). The CM starts and ends the step at the same height (the apothem), so net change in gravitational potential over a step is zero.\n- Energy over a step: With no slipping, the instantaneous center is the contact point, so kinetic energy is K = (1/2) I_P ω^2, where I_P is the moment of inertia about the contact point. The external force F does work W_in = F Δx in that step; normal and friction forces at the pivot do no work. Thus, from just after one impact (speed Ω) to just before the next (speed ω−), energy increases by W_in.\n- Impact mapping: At the next impact, the new vertex contacts the ground; the collision is perfectly inelastic with an impulsive contact force at the new vertex. Angular momentum about the new contact point is conserved across the impact (impulse has zero moment about its own point). This defines a linear map Ω = k ω−, with k < 1 (speed drop due to inelasticity).\n- Steady regime closure: In steady periodic rolling, the post-impact angular speed Ω is the same after each collision. Combine the energy balance over a step with the impact map to solve for Ω in terms of F, m, l, N.\n- Geometry-dependent inertia: The prism rotates about its axis (through the CM, along its length). The relevant CM moment of inertia is I_C = α m l^2, where for a uniform solid regular N-gon of circumradius l one has α = (2 + cos θ)/6 with θ = 2π/N. This reproduces known special cases: triangle α = 1/4, square α = 1/3, circle (N → ∞) α → 1/2.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Geometry per step and work input\n- Let θ = 2π/N.\n- Angle rotated about the current contact: Δφ = θ.\n- Horizontal CM advance per step:\n  Δx = 2 l sin(π/N) = 2 l sin(θ/2).\n- Work done by the constant force over one step:\n  W_in = F Δx = 2 F l sin(θ/2).\n\nStep 2: Kinetic energy description and energy balance between impacts\n- About the instantaneous contact point O, the kinetic energy is\n  K = (1/2) I_P ω^2,\n  where by the parallel-axis theorem I_P = I_C + m l^2.\n- Immediately after impact, the prism rotates about the current contact O with angular speed Ω; just before the next impact it rotates (still about O) with angular speed ω−. With no net change in gravitational potential over the step,\n  (1/2) I_P ω−^2 = (1/2) I_P Ω^2 + W_in.   (1)\n\nStep 3: Impact relation via angular momentum about the new contact\n- Let P be the next vertex to contact. During the instantaneous impact at P, angular momentum about P is conserved (the impulse at P has zero torque about P; the finite force F contributes negligible impulse over zero time).\n- Angular momentum about P just before impact:\n  H_P^− = I_C ω− + m (r_C/P × v_C)·ŷ,\n  where ŷ is along the prism axis (rotation axis), r_C/P is the CM position relative to P, and v_C is the CM velocity.\n- Since the body is rotating about O just before impact, v_C = ω− ŷ × r_C/O. Using the identity for components along ŷ:\n  [ r × (ŷ × s) ]·ŷ = r·s,\n  we get\n  H_P^− = ω− [ I_C + m (r_C/P · r_C/O) ].\n- Geometrically at the instant of impact, |r_C/O| = |r_C/P| = l and the angle between them is θ, so\n  r_C/P · r_C/O = l^2 cos θ.\n  Therefore,\n  H_P^− = ω− [ I_C + m l^2 cos θ ].\n- Immediately after impact, the body rotates about P with angular speed Ω, so\n  H_P^+ = I_P Ω = (I_C + m l^2) Ω.\n- Conservation H_P^− = H_P^+ gives the impact map\n  Ω = k ω−,   where   k = (I_C + m l^2 cos θ) / (I_C + m l^2).   (2)\n  Note that 0 < k < 1 for N ≥ 3 (cos θ < 1), representing loss of kinetic energy at impact.\n\nStep 4: Steady-state closure and solution for Ω\n- In the steady periodic regime, the post-impact angular speed is the same after every collision. Combining (1) with ω− = Ω/k from (2),\n  (1/2) I_P (Ω/k)^2 = (1/2) I_P Ω^2 + W_in\n  ⇒ (1/2) I_P Ω^2 (1/k^2 − 1) = W_in\n  ⇒ Ω^2 = 2 W_in / [ I_P (1/k^2 − 1) ].

Along the z-axis, for μ || z,\n  Fz = μ dBz/dr (with r measured from the image dipole to the real one and dr/dz = 1 for the upper dipole).\n  Therefore:\n  Fmag(h) = μ d/dr [ μ0 μ′/(2π r^3) ] = μ [ μ0 μ′/(2π) (−3 r^−4) ]\n           = − 3 μ0 μ μ′ / (2π r^4).\n- With μ′ = −μ and r = 2h,\n  Fmag(h) = 3 μ0 μ^2 / [2π (2h)^4] = 3 μ0 μ^2 / (32 π h^4).\nDirection: Upward (repulsive), as expected.\n\nStep 3: Electrostatic attraction to the superconducting plane (image charge)\n- Treat the plane as a grounded perfect conductor. A charge Q at height h induces an image charge −Q at −h.\n- The downward Coulomb force magnitude:\n  Felec(h) = (1/(4π ε0)) |Q (−Q)| / (2h)^2 = Q^2 / (16 π ε0 h^2).\n- Note on approximation: We are modeling the extended uniformly charged sphere by its net monopole Q for the electrostatic interaction with the plane. This is accurate when R ≪ h (field does not vary strongly across the sphere). We also require h > R (no contact).\n\nStep 4: Force balance and solution for h\n- Vertical force balance at steady levitation:\n  Upward magnetic = gravity + downward electrostatic\n  3 μ0 μ^2 / (32 π h^4) = m g + Q^2 / (16 π ε0 h^2).\n- Let x = h^2. Then:\n  3 μ0 μ^2 / (32 π x^2) = m g + Q^2 / (16 π ε0 x).\n- Multiply by x^2:\n  m g x^2 + (Q^2 / (16 π ε0)) x − (3 μ0 μ^2 / (32 π)) = 0.\n- This is a quadratic in x with a = m g, b = Q^2/(16 π ε0), and c = 3 μ0 μ^2/(32 π). The physically relevant (positive) root is:\n  x = [ − b + √( b^2 + 4 a c ) ] / (2 a),\n  so that\n  h = √x = [ [ − b + √( b^2 + 4 a c ) ] / (2 a) ]^(1/2).\n- Substitute μ = (Q ω R^2)/5 to express entirely in given parameters. First, 4 a c:\n  4 a c = 4 (m g) [ 3 μ0 μ^2 / (32 π) ] = (3 μ0 μ^2 m g) / (8 π)\n        = (3 μ0 m g)/(8 π) · (Q^2 ω^2 R^4)/25\n        = (3 μ0 Q^2 ω^2 R^4 m g)/(200 π).\n- Therefore:\n  h = { [ − (Q^2/(16 π ε0)) + √( (Q^2/(16 π ε0))^2 + (3 μ0 Q^2 ω^2 R^4 m g)/(200 π) ) ] / (2 m g) }^(1/2).\n\nStep 5: Useful limiting cases and consistency checks\n- Magnetic-dominated regime (electrostatic attraction small compared to mg):\n  If Q^2/(16 π ε0) ≪ √(4 a c), then b → 0 and\n  x ≈ √(c/a) ⇒ h ≈ [ c/(a) ]^(1/4) = [ 3 μ0 μ^2 / (32 π m g) ]^(1/4).\n  Using μ = Q ω R^2/5,\n  h ≈ [ (3 μ0 Q^2 ω^2 R^4) / (800 π m g) ]^(1/4).\n- Electrostatic-dominated over gravity (mg much smaller than electrostatic term):\n  If mg → 0, the balance gives b x ≈ c, hence\n  h ≈ √(c/b) = √{ [3 μ0 μ^2/(32 π)] / [Q^2/(16 π ε0)] }\n    = (|μ|/|Q|) √( (3 μ0 ε0)/2 ) = (√(3/2)/5) (ω R^2 / c),\n  where c = 1/√(μ0 ε0) is the speed of light. This shows a gravity-independent levitation height set by rotation, geometry, and electrovacuum constants in that extreme.\n\n- Units check:\n  - μ has units A·m^2; Fmag ∼ μ0 μ^2 / h^4 has N; electrostatic force ∼ Q^2/(ε0 h^2) has N; balance consistent. The resulting h has units of length.\n\n- Validity:\n  - Magnetic field of the rotating uniformly charged sphere is exactly dipolar for r > R, so the magnetic image-dipole force expression is accurate for h > R.\n  - The electrostatic image-charge force formula is accurate in the monopole approximation, i.e., when R ≪ h so that field variations across the sphere are small. This is typically satisfied for practical levitation configurations where the sphere is not extremely close to the plane.\n\n4. Final Result\n- Exact algebraic expression (within the stated approximations) for the levitation height is:\n  h = { [ − (Q^2/(16 π ε0)) + √( (Q^2/(16 π ε0))^2 + (3 μ0 Q^2 ω^2 R^4 m g)/(200 π) ) ] / (2 m g) }^(1/2),\n  with μ0 the vacuum permeability and ε0 the vacuum permittivity.\n\n- Magnetic moment used:\n  μ = (Q ω R^2)/5.\n\n- Limiting forms:\n  - Magnetic vs gravity only (electrostatics negligible): h ≈ [ 3 μ0 μ^2 / (32 π m g) ]^(1/4).\n  - Electrostatics vs magnetics only (gravity negligible): h ≈ (√(3/2)/5) (ω R^2 / c).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,h \\;=\\; \\left\\{ \\frac{ -\\,\\dfrac{Q^{2}}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{0}} \\;+\\; \\sqrt{\\left(\\dfrac{Q^{2}}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\right)^{2} \\;+\\; \\dfrac{3\\,\\mu_{0}\\,Q^{2}\\,\\omega^{2}\\,R^{4}\\,m g}{200\\,\\pi}} }{2\\,m g} \\right\\}^{\\!1/2} \\quad \\text{with}\\quad \\mu=\\dfrac{Q\\omega R^{2}}{5}\\,} \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We have a charged particle (charge q, mass m) in a uniform magnetic field B = B ẑ and a weak, nonuniform electrostatic field E = E0 cos(ky) x̂.\n- In a uniform B field, the particle executes Larmor gyration at cyclotron frequency Ω ≡ |q|B/m with Larmor radius ρ ≡ v⊥/Ω about a slowly drifting guiding center.\n- The drift of the guiding center caused by the electric field is the gyro-averaged E×B drift. Because E varies over the Larmor orbit, finite-Larmor-radius (FLR) effects enter.\n- Goal: Compute the guiding-center drift velocity v̄gc to the lowest order that distinguishes it from the uniform-E case.\n\n2. Approach\n- Treat E as weak so that:\n  - The fast motion is the unperturbed circular Larmor orbit with constant ρ = v⊥/Ω.\n  - The guiding center Xgc, Ygc drifts slowly; to leading order we can use the unperturbed orbit to evaluate the instantaneous E×B drift and then gyroaverage over one cyclotron period.\n- Parametrize the fast orbit as y(t) = Ygc + ρ cos(ϕ), with ϕ ≡ Ωt + δ (δ is the initial gyro phase), and x(t) = Xgc + s ρ sin(ϕ) with s = sgn(qB). Only y(t) will be needed.\n- Compute the instantaneous E×B drift vE(t) = E × B / B^2 = −[E0/B] cos(k y(t)) ŷ, and then gyroaverage ⟨⋯⟩ over ϕ.\n- Use the Jacobi–Anger/Bessel function identity ⟨cos(k[Ygc + ρ cos ϕ])⟩ϕ = J0(kρ) cos(k Ygc) to obtain the FLR-reduced drift.\n- Expand J0(kρ) ≈ 1 − (kρ)^2/4 to expose the first nontrivial correction relative to the locally uniform-E result.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n- Cyclotron motion and Larmor radius:\n  - Cyclotron frequency: Ω = |q| B / m.\n  - Larmor radius: ρ = v⊥ / Ω = m v⊥ / (|q| B).\n  - Fast orbit: y(t) = Ygc + ρ cos(Ω t + δ).\n  - At t = 0, the initial condition y0 relates to Ygc via y0 = Ygc + ρ cos δ, so Ygc ≈ y0 − ρ cos δ. In the weak-field, leading-order treatment, one may set Ygc ≈ y0 when only the drift at the initial time is needed to lowest order.\n\n- Instantaneous E×B drift:\n  - E × B = E0 cos(ky) x̂ × (B ẑ) = −E0 B cos(ky) ŷ.\n  - Hence vE(t) = (E × B)/B^2 = −(E0/B) cos(k y(t)) ŷ.\n\n- Gyroaverage over one cyclotron period:\n  - v̄gc = ⟨vE(t)⟩ = −(E0/B) ⟨cos(k[Ygc + ρ cos ϕ])⟩ ŷ.\n  - Use the identity (from the Jacobi–Anger expansion e^{i z cos ϕ} = Σn i^n Jn(z) e^{i n ϕ})\n    ⟨cos(k[Ygc + ρ cos ϕ])⟩ϕ = J0(kρ) cos(k Ygc).\n  - Therefore\n    v̄gc = −(E0/B) J0(kρ) cos(k Ygc) ŷ.\n\n- Lowest-order correction beyond uniform-E:\n  - If the electric field were uniform (k = 0), v̄gc = −(E0/B) ŷ, independent of position and ρ.\n  - With spatial variation but in the “zero–Larmor-radius” limit (kρ → 0), the drift is the local E×B drift evaluated at the guiding center: v̄gc ≈ −(E0/B) cos(k Ygc) ŷ.\n  - The first finite-Larmor-radius correction comes from the Bessel factor:\n    J0(kρ) ≈ 1 − (kρ)^2/4 + O((kρ)^4).\n  - Thus, to the lowest order that distinguishes it from the uniform-E result,\n    v̄gc ≈ −(E0/B) cos(k Ygc) [1 − (kρ)^2/4] ŷ.\n\n- Express in terms of initial data (optional at t = 0):\n  - ρ = m v⊥/(|q|B), with v⊥ = √[(v⊥ cos δ)^2 + (v⊥ sin δ)^2] given.\n  - Ygc(0) = y0 − ρ cos δ, so\n    v̄gc(0) ≈ −(E0/B) J0(kρ) cos(k[y0 − ρ cos δ]) ŷ\n    ≈ −(E0/B) cos(k y0) [1 − (kρ)^2/4] ŷ + O(kρ),\n    where the O(kρ) phase-dependent correction arises from expanding cos(k[y0 − ρ cos δ]). If one seeks the leading gyroaveraged correction independent of the fast phase, use Ygc ≈ y0.\n\nRemarks:\n- The result captures the key physics: the guiding-center E×B drift is reduced by the FLR factor J0(kρ) because the particle samples regions of different field during its gyro-orbit.\n- There is no polarization drift here because E is static. Magnetic-field gradients are absent, so no grad-B curvature drifts are present.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\displaystyle \\bar{\\mathbf{v}}_{\\mathrm{gc}} \\;=\\; -\\,\\frac{E_0}{B}\\,J_0(k\\rho)\\,\\cos\\!\\big(k\\,Y_{\\mathrm{gc}}\\big)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n\\;\\;\\approx\\;\\; -\\,\\frac{E_0}{B}\\,\\cos\\!\\big(k\\,Y_{\\mathrm{gc}}\\big)\\!\\left[1-\\frac{(k\\rho)^2}{4}\\right]\\hat{\\mathbf{y}},\\quad\n\\rho=\\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q|B},\\;\\; \\Omega=\\frac{|q|B}{m} } \\]"}

Eliminate ẍ using the ring’s equation to express T solely in terms of θ and θ̇, then substitute θ̇(θ) from energy.\n\nThis combines the “integrals of motion” path (momentum and energy) with a clean force-balance projection to obtain T(θ) without solving for θ̈.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Kinematics and energies\n- Place the rod along the x-axis with upward vertical y. Let the ring be at (x, 0). The string makes angle θ below the rod, so the unit vector along the string from ring to ball is e_s = (cosθ, −sinθ).\n- Ball position: r_B = (x + l cosθ, −l sinθ).\n- Velocities:\n  - Ring: v_A = (ẋ, 0).\n  - Ball: v_B = (ẋ − l θ̇ sinθ, −l θ̇ cosθ).\n\nHence the total kinetic energy:\nK = 1/2 m ẋ^2 + 1/2 m[(ẋ − l θ̇ sinθ)^2 + (l θ̇ cosθ)^2]\n  = (1/2)m ẋ^2 + (1/2)m[ẋ^2 − 2 ẋ l θ̇ sinθ + l^2 θ̇^2(sin^2θ + cos^2θ)]\n  = m ẋ^2 − m ẋ l θ̇ sinθ + (1/2) m l^2 θ̇^2.\n\nThe gravitational potential of the ball (taking U = 0 at the rod y = 0) is\nU = m g y_B = m g (−l sinθ) = −m g l sinθ.\n\nStep 2: Cyclic coordinate (horizontal momentum conservation)\nThe Lagrangian L = K − U does not depend explicitly on x, so the conjugate momentum p_x is conserved:\np_x = ∂L/∂ẋ = 2 m ẋ − m l θ̇ sinθ = constant.\nInitially the system is released from rest with θ = 0 and ẋ = θ̇ = 0, hence p_x = 0 and therefore\nẋ = (l/2) θ̇ sinθ.  (1)\n\nStep 3: Energy conservation and θ̇(θ)\nInitially K = 0, U = 0. At angle θ, energy conservation gives\nK + U = 0 ⇒ K = −U = m g l sinθ.\nSubstitute ẋ from (1) into K. Using v_B above, one finds conveniently\nK = (1/4) m l^2 θ̇^2 (2 − sin^2θ).\nThus,\n(1/4) m l^2 θ̇^2 (2 − sin^2θ) = m g l sinθ\n⇒ θ̇^2(θ) = 4 g sinθ / [l (2 − sin^2θ)].  (2)\n\nStep 4: Force balance along the string and elimination of ẍ\n- Acceleration of the ball:\na_B = d v_B/dt = (ẍ − l(θ̈ sinθ + θ̇^2 cosθ), −l(θ̈ cosθ − θ̇^2 sinθ)).\n\n- Project a_B along e_s = (cosθ, −sinθ):\na_B ⋅ e_s = ẍ cosθ − l θ̇^2.  (the θ̈ terms cancel)\n\nForces on the ball along e_s:\n- Tension acts from the ball toward the ring, i.e., along −e_s, contributing −T.\n- Gravity is (0, −m g); its projection on e_s is m g sinθ.\n\nNewton’s second law along the string gives\nm (ẍ cosθ − l θ̇^2) = −T + m g sinθ.  (3)\n\n- For the ring, the rod is smooth (no horizontal friction), so the only horizontal force is the horizontal component of the string tension, T cosθ. Thus\nm ẍ = T cosθ ⇒ ẍ = (T/m) cosθ.  (4)\n\nSubstitute (4) into (3):\nm [(T/m) cosθ ⋅ cosθ − l θ̇^2] = −T + m g sinθ\n⇒ T cos^2θ − m l θ̇^2 = −T + m g sinθ\n⇒ T (1 + cos^2θ) = m l θ̇^2 + m g sinθ.  (5)\n\nNote 1 + cos^2θ = 2 − sin^2θ.\n\nStep 5: Substitute θ̇(θ) from energy and simplify\nFrom (2): m l θ̇^2 = 4 m g sinθ / (2 − sin^2θ).\nInsert into (5):\nT (2 − sin^2θ) = [4 m g sinθ / (2 − sin^2θ)] + m g sinθ\n⇒ T = m g sinθ [4/(2 − sin^2θ) + 1] / (2 − sin^2θ)\n⇒ T(θ) = m g sinθ (6 − sin^2θ) / (2 − sin^2θ)^2.\n\nStep 6: Checks\n- As θ → 0+, sinθ → 0, T → 0. This matches the instantaneous release from a horizontal string: gravity has no component along the string, and there is initially no centripetal requirement.\n- At θ = 90°, sinθ = 1: θ̇^2 = 4 g/l, so the ball needs tension to support its weight plus provide centripetal acceleration l θ̇^2. The formula gives T = m g (6 − 1)/(2 − 1)^2 = 5 m g, consistent with T = m g + m l θ̇^2 = m g + 4 m g.\n\n4) Final Answer\nTension as a function of the angle θ between the string and the horizontal rod:\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,T(\\theta) = \\dfrac{m g \\,\\sin\\theta\\,\\big(6 - \\sin^2\\theta\\big)}{\\big(2 - \\sin^2\\theta\\big)^2}\\,} \\]"}
{"id": "MECHANICS/716", "questions": "The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q. A lightweight, smooth-walled insulating thin tube can rotate around a vertical axis through point O in the horizontal plane. At a distance L from point O inside the tube, there is a photoelectric trigger control switch A. A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined. If the distance OB is measured to be $L/2$, determine the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube when the ball is at point B.

A spring of free length L/4 is attached at O and the bead, providing an inward radial force when stretched.\n- Initially, the tube is driven by an external torque. When the bead reaches the position A at r = L and is just in radial equilibrium, a switch flips the central charge to −Q and simultaneously cuts the external torque to zero.\n- After that instant, the bead-tube system evolves without external torque; the bead eventually settles to a new radial equilibrium at a measured position B with OB = L/2.\n- The task: Find the tube’s angular speed ω when the bead is at B, in terms of k, Q, q, m, and L.\n\nKey physical ingredients:\n- Radial force balance (centripetal requirement) at the two equilibrium positions.\n- Conservation of angular momentum about O after the external torque is cut (because all forces thereafter are central/radial, producing no torque about O; the tube is lightweight).\n\n2) Approach\n- Introduce the spring constant K for the light spring of natural length L/4.\n- Write the radial (centripetal) force-balance equations at:\n  (i) r = L, with central charge +Q (repulsive), at the trigger instant.

No external forces act on the mirror.\n- We are asked to find the mirror’s final speed v1 = β1 c after irradiation, in terms of m, c, β0, and E.\n\nKey physical effects:\n- For a moving mirror, reflection causes a double Doppler shift. For a mirror receding from the photons (co-propagating case), the reflected photon energy is reduced by a factor (1 − β)/(1 + β).\n- The mirror’s momentum increases due to the change in light momentum. Because the mirror accelerates during the exposure, we treat the interaction differentially and integrate over the delivered energy.\n\n2) Approach\n- Use conservation of momentum for the combined system (mirror + radiation) in the lab frame.\n- Consider an infinitesimal incident energy dE when the mirror’s instantaneous speed is β. The reflected energy is dE_out = dE (1 − β)/(1 + β) by the double Doppler effect.\n- The mirror receives a momentum increment dp equal to the negative of the light’s momentum change: dp = (dE + dE_out)/c.\n- Relate dp to the mirror’s relativistic momentum p = γ m β c to obtain a differential equation for β as a function of the cumulative incident energy.\n- Integrate using the identity that d[γ(1 + β)] = (1 + β) d(γ β), which makes the integral elementary.\n- Solve the resulting algebra in terms of the forward Doppler factor A ≡ γ(1 + β) = √[(1 + β)/(1 − β)], and invert to β.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep 1: Double Doppler shift for a receding mirror\n- Let dE be the lab-frame incident energy when the mirror has speed β. Transform to the mirror frame (frequency downshift factor γ(1 − β)), reflect (energy unchanged in mirror frame), and transform back to the lab for the backward-going photon (another γ(1 − β)). Thus,\n  dE_out/dE = [γ(1 − β)] [γ(1 − β)] = γ^2 (1 − β)^2 = (1 − β)/(1 + β),\n  because γ^2 = 1/(1 − β^2).\nTherefore,\n  dE_out = dE (1 − β)/(1 + β).\n\nStep 2: Momentum transfer to the mirror\n- The incident photon momentum is +dE/c, and the reflected photon travels backward with momentum magnitude dE_out/c, so the light’s momentum change is\n  Δp_light = (−dE_out/c) − (dE/c) = −(dE + dE_out)/c.\n- By momentum conservation, the mirror gains\n  dp_mirror = −Δp_light = (dE + dE_out)/c = 2 dE/[c(1 + β)].\n- Relate to the mirror’s relativistic momentum p = γ m β c:\n  d(γ m β c) = 2 dE/[c(1 + β)].\nDivide by m c:\n  d(γ β) = [2/(m c^2)] dE/(1 + β).    (1)\n\nStep 3: Exact differential and integration\n- Use the identity d[γ(1 + β)] = (1 + β) d(γ β). One may verify it by using dγ = γ^3 β dβ.\n- Multiply (1) by (1 + β) and recognize the exact differential:\n  (1 + β) d(γ β) = [2/(m c^2)] dE\n  ⇒ d[γ(1 + β)] = [2/(m c^2)] dE.\n- Integrate from initial state (β0) to final state (β1) while the cumulative incident energy grows from 0 to E:\n  γ1(1 + β1) − γ0(1 + β0) = 2E/(m c^2).

Problem Analysis\nWe have a homogeneous rectangular picture frame of length 2c (long side) and width 2d (short side), mass m, hung by a light, inextensible string of total length 2a that passes over a frictionless nail O. The string’s ends are attached to the two vertices A and B of one long side of the frame. The frame comes to static equilibrium at some angle α ∈ (0, π/2] that the long side makes with the horizontal. We are asked to find α (as a function of a, c, d), under the condition c^4 > a^2 d^2 − c^2 d^2. Gravity acts downward with acceleration g. The mass and gravity determine the tension’s magnitude but, as we will see, do not affect the equilibrium angle α.\n\n2. Approach\n- Choose a body-fixed orthonormal basis {e1, e2} for the frame: e1 along the long side (length 2c) and e2 along the short side (length 2d). Let the frame center be C.\n- Let the nail O be vertically above C by a distance s (this is equivalent to choosing s so that torque about O vanishes; the two string forces act through O so their net moment about O is zero, hence mg must also act through the same vertical line).\n- Write the position vectors from O to the attachment points A and B in the frame basis; denote them OA and OB.\n- Use force balance. The string is frictionless, so the tensions in OA and OB are equal. Zero net horizontal force implies the sum of the unit vectors along OA and OB has no horizontal component. This gives a ratio between |OA| and |OB|.\n- Use the length constraint |OA| + |OB| = 2a to obtain |OA| and |OB| explicitly in terms of α.\n- Use the identity |OA|^2 − |OB|^2 = 4 c s sin α to find s cos α in terms of a, c, d.\n- Finally, use |OA|^2 = X_A^2 + Y^2 (with X_A, Y the frame components) to eliminate s entirely and solve for tan α. The linear terms cancel, leaving a quadratic in tan^2 α.\n\nKey insight: Projecting OA and OB onto the lab horizontal axis removes the unknown s, enabling a direct determination of |OA| and |OB| in terms of α alone.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Geometry and coordinates\n- Let the long side AB be the lower long side of the frame (both A and B have frame-basis e2-coordinate −d), with A at (+c, −d) and B at (−c, −d) relative to C.\n- Let the lab axes be x-hat (horizontal) and y-hat (vertical). The frame basis {e1, e2} is rotated by angle α from the lab axes:\n  x-hat = cos α e1 − sin α e2,  y-hat = sin α e1 + cos α e2.\n- Place the nail O a vertical distance s above C: OC = s y-hat = s(sin α e1 + cos α e2).\n- Then the vectors from O to A and B in the frame basis are:\n  OA = OC + CA = (c + s sin α, s cos α − d),\n  OB = OC + CB = (−c + s sin α, s cos α − d).\n\nDenote the frame-basis components as\n  X_A = c + s sin α,  X_B = −c + s sin α,  Y = s cos α − d.\n\nStep 2: Torque equilibrium about O\nBecause each string force acts along a line passing through O, their net torque about O is zero. For the total torque to vanish, the weight mg acting at C must also have zero torque about O; thus OC is vertical. We enforced this by construction, OC = s y-hat.\n\nStep 3: Horizontal force balance and length ratio\nLet OA_x and OB_x denote the lab-horizontal projections of OA and OB. Using x-hat = cos α e1 − sin α e2:\n- OA_x = X_A cos α − Y sin α = (c + s sin α) cos α − (s cos α − d) sin α = c cos α + d sin α,\n- OB_x = X_B cos α − Y sin α = (−c + s sin α) cos α − (s cos α − d) sin α = −c cos α + d sin α.\n\nNote the s-dependent terms cancel; these projections are independent of s.\n\nWith equal tensions T, the horizontal force balance requires\n  OA_x/|OA| + OB_x/|OB| = 0.\nFor both string legs to be taut, we need −c cos α + d sin α < 0, i.e. 0 < tan α < c/d. Then OB_x < 0 and we can write\n  |OA| : |OB| = OA_x : (−OB_x) = (c cos α + d sin α) : (c cos α − d sin α).\n\nImposing the total length constraint, |OA| + |OB| = 2a, gives explicitly\n  |OA| = a [1 + (d/c) tan α],     |OB| = a [1 − (d/c) tan α].         (1)\nThese are valid provided 0 < tan α < c/d (so that both are positive).\n\nStep 4: Eliminating s using a difference identity\nFrom the components, we get\n  |OA|^2 − |OB|^2 = (X_A^2 + Y^2) − (X_B^2 + Y^2) = X_A^2 − X_B^2\n                  = (c + s sin α)^2 − (−c + s sin α)^2 = 4 c s sin α.\n\nOn the other hand, using (1):\n  |OA|^2 − |OB|^2 = a^2[(1 + β)^2 − (1 − β)^2] = 4 a^2 β,\nwhere β := (d/c) tan α.\n\nEquating these:\n  4 c s sin α = 4 a^2 β = 4 a^2 (d/c) tan α\n⇒ c s sin α = a^2 (d/c) tan α\n⇒ c s cos α · tan α = a^2 (d/c) tan α\n⇒ s cos α = a^2 d / c^2.                                             (2)\n\nThus Y = s cos α − d = d (a^2/c^2 − 1) is a constant, independent of α.\n\nStep 5: Solve for α from |OA|^2 = X_A^2 + Y^2\nUse |OA| from (1) and components X_A, Y. From (2),\n  s sin α = (s cos α) tan α = (a^2 d / c^2) tan α.\nHence\n  X_A = c + s sin α = c + (a^2 d / c^2) tan α,\n  Y   = d (a^2/c^2 − 1).\n\nImpose |OA|^2 = X_A^2 + Y^2:\n  a^2 [1 + (d/c) tan α]^2 = [c + (a^2 d / c^2) tan α]^2 + d^2 (a^2/c^2 − 1)^2.\n\nLet t = tan α and β = (d/c) t. Also set ν = a^2 / c^2. Then\n  left = a^2 (1 + β)^2,\n  right = c^2 [1 + ν β]^2 + d^2 (ν − 1)^2.\n\nExpanding shows the linear-in-β terms cancel, leaving a quadratic in β^2:\n  a^2 (ν − 1) β^2 + (c^2 − a^2) + d^2 (ν − 1)^2 = 0.\nSolving for β^2 and substituting ν = a^2/c^2 gives\n  β^2 = (c^4 + c^2 d^2 − a^2 d^2) / (a^2 c^2).\n\nSince β^2 = (d^2/c^2) t^2, we obtain\n  tan^2 α = t^2 = (c^4 + c^2 d^2 − a^2 d^2) / (a^2 d^2).\n\nBecause α ∈ (0, π/2], take the positive root. The tautness condition requires 0 < tan α < c/d; this is consistent provided a > c (otherwise the limit tan α → c/d is approached as a → c^+). The given condition c^4 > a^2 d^2 − c^2 d^2 ensures the numerator is positive, so a real solution exists.\n\nTherefore\n  tan α = sqrt(c^4 + c^2 d^2 − a^2 d^2) / (a d).\n\nRemarks:\n- The angle α is independent of m and g; these set the magnitude of the tension at equilibrium but not the orientation.\n- The nail’s vertical offset s relative to the frame satisfies s cos α = a^2 d / c^2, which can be used to find the frame’s vertical position once α is known.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\alpha \\;=\\; \\arctan\\!\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\,c^{4}+c^{2}d^{2}-a^{2}d^{2}\\,}}{a\\,d}\\right) \\quad \\text{with } 0<\\tan\\alpha<\\frac{c}{d},\\;\\; c^{4}>a^{2}d^{2}-c^{2}d^{2} } \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We have a homogeneous sphere of radius R, permittivity ε = ε0 εr, and finite conductivity σ, placed in vacuum.\n- At t = 0 a uniform external electric field E0 (maintained by distant sources) is applied. Free charge then builds up on the sphere’s surface, and the system relaxes to the steady-state of a perfect conductor (equipotential sphere, zero internal field).\n- We are asked to find the total Joule heat Q dissipated in the sphere during the entire relaxation from the initial state (dielectric response, no free surface charge) to the final steady state (conductor-like).\n\nKey physical points:\n- Only the l = 1 (dipolar) mode is excited by a uniform field.\n- The internal field remains spatially uniform during the transient; its amplitude decays exponentially with a characteristic time τ set by σ and εr.\n- The total heat is independent of σ (σ controls only how fast, not how much, dissipation occurs).\n\n2. Approach\nWe provide a complete solution by:\n- Deriving the transient internal field E_in(t) via a quasi-static l = 1 potential ansatz, boundary conditions, and charge/current continuity at the surface. This yields an ODE for the internal field amplitude A(t) with solution A(t) = A0 e^(−t/τ).\n- Computing the total Joule heat directly from Q = ∫∫ σ|E_in|^2 dV dt.\n- Cross-checking the result using an energy/polarizability viewpoint: for an object in a fixed external field E0, the electrostatic energy difference is U = −(1/2) α E0^2. The total heat equals the decrease in this energy as the polarizability changes from its initial dielectric value to the final conductor value.\n\nThese complementary routes give the same Q and also reveal the relaxation time τ and the power profile.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n3.1 Field ansatz and boundary conditions (l = 1)\nChoose the z-axis along E0. The most general axisymmetric potentials are:\n- Inside r < R: φ_in(r, θ, t) = −A(t) r cosθ\n- Outside r > R: φ_out(r, θ, t) = −E0 r cosθ + B(t) cosθ / r^2\n\nContinuity of potential at r = R gives:\n- A(t) R = E0 R − B(t)/R^2 ⇒ B(t) = R^3 [E0 − A(t)]\n\nThe radial (normal) electric fields at r = R are:\n- E_in,n(R, t) = −∂φ_in/∂r|_R = A(t) cosθ\n- E_out,n(R, t) = −∂φ_out/∂r|_R = [E0 + 2 B(t)/R^3] cosθ = [3E0 − 2A(t)] cosθ\n\nThe free surface charge density follows from the normal D jump:\n- σ_f(θ, t) = ε0 E_out,n − ε0 εr E_in,n\n= ε0 [3E0 − 2A(t) − εr A(t)] cosθ\n= ε0 [3E0 − (εr + 2) A(t)] cosθ\n\n3.2 Initial condition at t = 0+\nImmediately after turn-on, before conduction has moved free charge, σ_f = 0. Imposing σ_f(θ, 0+) = 0 gives:\n- 3E0 − (εr + 2) A(0+) = 0 ⇒ A(0+) ≡ A0 = 3E0/(εr + 2)\n\nThis is the familiar internal field of a dielectric sphere in a uniform field.\n\n3.3 Surface current continuity and the ODE for A(t)\nCurrent continuity at the surface gives:\n- ∂σ_f/∂t = n · J_in (outside vacuum has no conduction), with J_in = σ E_in\n- Hence ∂σ_f/∂t = σ E_in,n = σ A(t) cosθ\n\nDifferentiate σ_f(θ, t):\n- ∂σ_f/∂t = ε0 [−(εr + 2) dA/dt] cosθ\n\nEquating gives:\n- ε0 [−(εr + 2) dA/dt] = σ A\n⇒ −ε0 (εr + 2) dA/dt = σ A\n\nSolve for A(t):\n- dA/A = −[σ/(ε0(εr + 2))] dt\n⇒ A(t) = A0 e^(−t/τ), with τ = ε0 (εr + 2) / σ\n\nThus the internal electric field is uniform and decays exponentially:\n- E_in(t) = A(t) ẑ = [3E0/(εr + 2)] e^(−t/τ) ẑ\n\n3.4 Surface charge evolution (useful check)\nUsing σ_f(θ, t) = ε0 [3E0 − (εr + 2) A(t)] cosθ and A(t) above:\n- σ_f(θ, t) = ε0 [3E0 − (εr + 2) A0 e^(−t/τ)] cosθ\n= ε0 [3E0 − 3E0 e^(−t/τ)] cosθ\n= 3 ε0 E0 (1 − e^(−t/τ)) cosθ\n\nHence σ_f grows from 0 at t = 0+ to the conductor limit σ_f(θ, ∞) = 3 ε0 E0 cosθ (independent of εr), as expected.\n\n3.5 Total Joule heat from the transient field\nThe instantaneous dissipated power is:\n- P(t) = ∫_V σ |E_in(t)|^2 dV = σ V A(t)^2\nwhere V = (4/3) π R^3 is the sphere volume.\n\nInsert A(t) = A0 e^(−t/τ):\n- P(t) = σ V A0^2 e^(−2t/τ)\n\nThe total heat is:\n- Q = ∫_0^∞ P(t) dt = σ V A0^2 ∫_0^∞ e^(−2t/τ) dt\n= σ V A0^2 (τ/2)\n\nSubstitute A0 and τ:\n- A0 = 3E0/(εr + 2), τ = ε0 (εr + 2)/σ\n\nThus\n- Q = σ V (9 E0^2/(εr + 2)^2) [ε0 (εr + 2)/(2σ)]\n= V ε0 [9 E0^2/(2(εr + 2))]\n\nWith V = (4/3) π R^3:\n- Q = (4/3) π R^3 ε0 [9 E0^2/(2(εr + 2))]\n= 6 π ε0 R^3 E0^2 / (εr + 2)\n\nImportant features:\n- Q is independent of σ (σ only sets τ = ε0(εr + 2)/σ).\n- The power profile is P(t) = (2Q/τ) e^(−2t/τ).\n\n3.6 Energetic cross-check via polarizability\nFor a body in a uniform field E0 maintained by external sources, the electrostatic energy relative to the bare uniform field is:\n- U = −(1/2) α E0^2\nwhere α is the (static) polarizability defined by p = α E0.\n\n- Initial state (t = 0+): dielectric sphere polarizability\nα_d = 4π ε0 R^3 (εr − 1)/(εr + 2)\n- Final state (t → ∞): conductor polarizability\nα_c = 4π ε0 R^3\n\nThe energy change during relaxation is:\n- ΔU = U_final − U_initial = −(1/2) (α_c − α_d) E0^2\n= −(1/2) [4π ε0 R^3 (1 − (εr − 1)/(εr + 2))] E0^2\n= −(1/2) [4π ε0 R^3 (3/(εr + 2))] E0^2\n= −6 π ε0 R^3 E0^2 / (εr + 2)\n\nThis decrease in field energy equals the total heat dissipated (the source holds E0 fixed), giving:\n- Q = −ΔU = 6 π ε0 R^3 E0^2 / (εr + 2)\n\nThis matches the direct transient calculation.\n\n4. Final Answer\n- The total Joule heat dissipated as the lossy dielectric sphere relaxes from its initial dielectric response to the final conducting state is:\nQ = 6 π ε0 R^3 E0^2 / (εr + 2)\n\n- The relaxation time and power profile (supplementary results) are:\nτ = ε0 (εr + 2) / σ\nP(t) = (2Q/τ) e^(−2t/τ)\n\nThese show σ affects the time scale, not the total heat.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ Q \\;=\\; \\dfrac{6\\,\\pi\\,\\varepsilon_0\\,R^3\\,E_0^2}{\\varepsilon_r + 2} } \\]"}

The locus of such “just-detaching” points on the sphere is a curve; its projection onto the xy-plane bounds the region where droplets cannot be normally flung off.\n- We are asked to derive the equation of this projected boundary curve on the xy-plane, expressed as y^2 in terms of x, for ω > ω1, where ω1 is the minimum angular speed needed to fling water off at the top.\n\n2) Approach\n- Use Newton’s second law for a droplet moving with the rotating surface. While attached, the droplet’s inertial acceleration equals the rigid-body centripetal acceleration a = ω × (ω × s), where s is the vector from the sphere’s center to the surface point.\n- The contact (normal) force N vanishes at detachment. Projecting the force balance along the surface normal gives a scalar condition for detachment.\n- Combine this with the sphere’s equation x^2 + y^2 + (z − H)^2 = R^2 to find the 3D detachment curve on the sphere.\n- Eliminate the vertical offset u = z − H to obtain the projection onto the xy-plane.

Dot with n:\n  m a · n = −N + m g⃗ · n.\n- Detachment means N = 0, hence a · n = g⃗ · n.\n\n- Compute the dots using n = s/R:\n  a · n = (0, −ω^2 y, −ω^2 u) · (x, y, u)/R = −ω^2(y^2 + u^2)/R,\n  g⃗ · n = (0, 0, −g) · (x, y, u)/R = −g u/R.\n\n- Therefore the detachment condition is\n  ω^2(y^2 + u^2) = g u.

Problem Analysis\n- We have a steel ruler whose evenly spaced scale marks (graduations) form a one-dimensional grating. The marks are oriented perpendicular to the ruler’s axis; the periodicity along the ruler axis is d.\n- The ruler lies in the horizontal plane (set ξ = 0). Its axis is in the y–z plane, making an angle φ with the z-axis (which points toward the wall). A laser beam is incident along +z (normal to the wall). The wall (screen) is at distance L along z from the scattering region.\n- We seek the spacing Δy between adjacent primary (principal) maxima on the wall near the zeroth-order maximum.\n\n2. Approach\n- Model the graduations as a 1D grating with lattice vector a = d â along the ruler axis. Because the structure is invariant along the line direction of the marks, diffraction is determined by the grating (lattice) periodicity along â.\n- Use the grating equation in vector form based on conservation of the component of the wavevector modulo reciprocal lattice vectors: (k_out − k_in) · a = 2π m, where m ∈ ℤ is the diffraction order.\n- Express the ruler axis unit vector â in terms of the coordinate axes: â = cosφ ẑ + sinφ ŷ (since the ruler lies in the y–z plane at angle φ to z).\n- For normal incidence k_in = (2π/λ) ẑ and far-field propagation direction s (unit vector), write k_out = (2π/λ) s. Then solve for the angular position of the m-th order near the central maximum (small-angle approximation), and map to the screen coordinate y at z = L.\n- The spacing Δy between adjacent orders m and m+1 follows directly.\n\nA helpful alternate viewpoint: the effective grating spacing projected perpendicular to the observation direction is d_eff = d sinφ, so the usual small-angle grating formula yields Δy = L λ / d_eff = L λ / (d sinφ).\n\n3. Solution Steps\n- Geometry and definitions:\n  - Coordinate axes: x downward, z toward the wall, y horizontal along the wall. The ruler lies in the horizontal plane (y–z plane) at angle φ to z; hence its unit direction vector is â = cosφ ẑ + sinφ ŷ.\n  - Lattice vector of the 1D grating (spacing along the ruler): a = d â.\n  - Incident wavevector: k_in = (2π/λ) ẑ.\n  - Outgoing (diffracted) direction: unit vector s with components (s_x, s_y, s_z), and k_out = (2π/λ) s.\n\n- Grating (vector) diffraction condition:\n  (k_out − k_in) · a = 2π m\n  Substitute a = d â and k’s:\n  (2π/λ) (s − ẑ) · (d â) = 2π m\n  ⇒ (s − ẑ) · â = m λ / d\n\n- Evaluate (s − ẑ) · â:\n  â = cosφ ẑ + sinφ ŷ\n  Hence\n  (s − ẑ) · â = s · â − ẑ · â = (s_z cosφ + s_y sinφ) − cosφ = sinφ s_y + cosφ (s_z − 1)\n\n- Near the zeroth-order maximum, the diffracted directions are close to ẑ, so s_z ≈ 1 and s_y is small. Keeping leading-order terms:\n  (s − ẑ) · â ≈ sinφ s_y\n\n  Therefore the grating condition becomes\n  sinφ s_y ≈ m λ / d\n  ⇒ s_y ≈ m λ / (d sinφ)\n\n- Map to the observation screen at z = L:\n  The intersection point on the wall is at y ≈ L (s_y / s_z). Near the central maximum s_z ≈ 1, so\n  y_m ≈ L s_y ≈ L m λ / (d sinφ)\n\n- Spacing between adjacent primary maxima:\n  Δy = y_{m+1} − y_m ≈ L λ / (d sinφ)\n\n- Consistency checks:\n  - If φ → 90°, the ruler axis is along y, so d_eff = d and Δy → L λ / d, the familiar grating spacing on a normal screen.\n  - If φ → 0°, the ruler axis aligns with z; d_eff = d sinφ → 0, so Δy becomes large, reflecting that the variation along y is weak for a nearly longitudinal grating.\n\n4. Final Answer\n- The spacing of primary maxima near the zeroth-order maximum is\n  Δy = L λ / (d sinφ)\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\Delta y \\;=\\; \\dfrac{L\\,\\lambda}{d\\,\\sin\\phi}} \\]"}

Eliminating φ̇ in favor of pφ yields a 1D radial motion with an effective potential Ueff(r).\n- A circular orbit corresponds to an extremum of Ueff(r): Ueff′(R) = 0, which gives the relation between the orbit’s angular frequency and B(R).\n- The small-oscillation frequency Ω about r = R is obtained from Ω^2 = Ueff″(R)/m.\n- Two reasoning paths were considered: an initial quick differentiation suggested Ω^2 ∝ (n + 3), but that fails the uniform-field check (n = 0 should give Ω = ωc). A careful, gauge-invariant differentiation using identities specific to axisymmetry yields Ω^2 ∝ (n + 1), which passes all consistency checks. We present the careful derivation.\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep A: Vector potential and Lagrangian\n- Choose an axisymmetric vector potential A = Aφ(r) eφ with\n  Bz(r) = (1/r) d/dr [r Aφ(r)] = B0 (r/R)^n.\n- One convenient choice (for n ≠ −2) is\n  Aφ(r) = B0 r^{n+1}/[(n + 2) R^n],\n  since then d/dr [r Aφ(r)] = B0 r^{n+1}/R^n = r Bz(r).\n- The planar Lagrangian is\n  L = (m/2)(ṙ^2 + r^2 φ̇^2) + q r Aφ(r) φ̇.\n\nStep B: Cyclic coordinate and effective potential\n- φ is cyclic, so the canonical angular momentum\n  pφ = ∂L/∂φ̇ = m r^2 φ̇ + q r Aφ(r)\n  is conserved.\n- Solve for φ̇:\n  φ̇ = [pφ − q r Aφ(r)]/(m r^2).\n- Since the magnetic field does no work, the total energy is purely kinetic:\n  E = (m/2)(ṙ^2 + r^2 φ̇^2) = (1/2) m ṙ^2 + Ueff(r),\n  with the effective potential\n  Ueff(r) = [pφ − q r Aφ(r)]^2 / (2 m r^2).\n- Define f(r) := pφ − q r Aφ(r). Then Ueff(r) = f(r)^2 / [2 m r^2].\n\nUseful identity for derivatives:\n- In axisymmetric geometry,\n  d/dr [r Aφ(r)] = r Bz(r) ⇒ Aφ + r Aφ′ = r B(r).\n- Therefore\n  f′(r) = − q [Aφ + r Aφ′] = − q r B(r),\n  f″(r) = − q [B(r) + r B′(r)].\n\nStep C: Circular orbit at r = R\n- A circular orbit is an extremum of Ueff: Ueff′(R) = 0.\n- Differentiate Ueff:\n  Ueff′ = (1/m)[ f f′/r^2 − f^2/r^3 ].\n- Set r = R and Ueff′(R) = 0:\n  0 = (1/m)[ f(R) f′(R)/R^2 − f(R)^2/R^3 ] ⇒ R f′(R) − f(R) = 0.\n- Using f′(R) = − q R B(R) and B(R) = B0, we get\n  f(R) = R f′(R) = − q R^2 B0.\n- The angular frequency of the circular orbit follows from\n  φ̇0 = f(R)/(m R^2) = − (q/m) B0.\n  Its magnitude is the cyclotron frequency ωc = |q| B0/m.\n\nStep D: Small radial oscillations: curvature of Ueff\n- The second derivative needed is\n  Ueff″(r) = (1/m)[ (f′^2 + f f″)/r^2 − 4 f f′/r^3 + 3 f^2/r^4 ].\n- Evaluate at r = R using\n  f(R) = − q R^2 B0,\n  f′(R) = − q R B0,\n  f″(R) = − q [B0 + R B′(R)].\n- Since B(r) = B0 (r/R)^n, we have B′(r) = n B(r)/r ⇒ B0 + R B′(R) = (n + 1) B0.\n  Hence f″(R) = − q (n + 1) B0.\n\nCompute term-by-term at r = R:\n- f′(R)^2/R^2 = (q^2 R^2 B0^2)/R^2 = q^2 B0^2.\n- f(R) f″(R)/R^2 = [− q R^2 B0][− q (n + 1) B0]/R^2 = q^2 (n + 1) B0^2.\n- −4 f(R) f′(R)/R^3 = −4 [ (− q R^2 B0)(− q R B0)/R^3 ] = −4 q^2 B0^2.\n- 3 f(R)^2/R^4 = 3 [ q^2 R^4 B0^2 / R^4 ] = 3 q^2 B0^2.\n\nSumming inside brackets:\n  [ q^2 B0^2 + q^2 (n + 1) B0^2 − 4 q^2 B0^2 + 3 q^2 B0^2 ]\n  = q^2 B0^2 (n + 1).\n\nTherefore,\n  Ueff″(R) = (1/m) q^2 B0^2 (n + 1).\n\nSmall-oscillation frequency and period:\n- Ω^2 = Ueff″(R)/m = (q^2 B0^2/m^2)(n + 1).\n  Thus Ω = (|q| B0/m) √(n + 1).\n- The oscillation period is\n  T = 2π/Ω = 2π m / (|q| B0 √(n + 1)).\n\nStability:\n- Small oscillations are stable for Ω^2 > 0 ⇒ n + 1 > 0 ⇒ n > −1.\n- Checks:\n  - Uniform field (n = 0): Ω = |q| B0/m = ωc, so T = 2π/ωc, as expected.\n  - Marginal case (n = −1): Ω = 0 (neutral stability).\n  - Strongly decreasing fields (n < −1): instability.\n\n4) Final Answer\nThe period of small radial oscillations about the circular orbit of radius R is\nT = 2π m / (|q| B0 √(n + 1)),\nvalid for n > −1 (stability condition).

The azimuthal separation between adjacent meridian planes is π/n, so the configuration is invariant under rotation about the z-axis by π/n.\n- A test charge −q (with q > 0 denoting its magnitude) of mass m moves on a nearly circular orbit of radius r0 ≫ R in the equatorial plane. We give it a small radial perturbation and are asked to find the difference between its radial oscillation period Tr and its angular revolution period Tφ.\n- The goal is to compute Tr − Tφ to leading order in the small parameter (R/r0)^2.\n\n2) Approach\n- Symmetry and multipoles: For r0 ≫ R, the electrostatic potential of the source can be expanded in multipoles. The discrete rotational symmetry (rotation by π/n about z) kills all spherical-harmonic components with azimuthal number m that are not multiples of 2n. Hence for all multipoles with l < 2n, only axisymmetric (m = 0) pieces survive. In particular, up to order (R/r0)^2, only the monopole (l = 0) and the quadrupole (l = 2, m = 0) contribute on the equatorial plane. This guarantees a central (axisymmetric) potential at the order of interest and thus conservation of angular momentum to this order.\n- Compute the potential on the equator to O((R/r)^2): We find the monopole and the l = 2, m = 0 contribution. Two independent routes give the same coefficient:\n  - Spherical-harmonic moment a20,\n  - Cartesian quadrupole tensor Q̃ij of the ring set.\n- Dynamics in a slightly non-Keplerian central potential U(r) = −α/r + β/r^3: The monopole gives the usual Kepler term; the quadrupole produces a small 1/r^3 correction. We compute the angular frequency ωφ and the radial (epicyclic) frequency ωr for a circular orbit at r0, expand to first order in (R/r0)^2, then extract Tr − Tφ.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\n3.1) Symmetry and axisymmetric truncation\n- Let the total surface/line-charge distribution be the sum of n identical great-circle rings rotated by azimuths φk = k(π/n), k = 0,…,n − 1, about the z-axis.\n- Under a z-rotation by φ, a spherical harmonic Yℓm picks up a phase e^{imφ}. Summing over the n rings multiplies each coefficient aℓm by S_m = ∑_{k=0}^{n−1} e^{im k π/n}.\n- S_m = 0 unless m is a multiple of 2n. Therefore, for ℓ < 2n, all non-axisymmetric components (m ≠ 0) vanish. In particular, for ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, only m = 0 survives.\n- Consequently, up to order (R/r)^2 the potential is exactly axisymmetric, and the first non-axisymmetric term occurs at ℓ = 2n with amplitude ∼ (R/r)^{2n} ≪ (R/r)^2. This justifies treating the field (to our working order) as central and the orbit as Keplerian with a small 1/r^3 correction.\n\n3.2) Far-field potential on the equator to O((R/r)^2)\nLet the total source charge be nQ.\n\nRoute A: Spherical-harmonic expansion (sketch)\n- The potential for r ≫ R can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/4πϵ0) [ (Q00)/r + (4π/5)(Q20 Y20(θ))/r^3 + … ], keeping only ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, m = 0.\n- Monopole: Q00 = √(1/4π) nQ.\n- Quadrupole: Treat each meridian ring as a line charge λ = Q/(2πR) at radius R and integrate Y20 over the ring. One finds (using Y20(θ) = √(5/16π)(3 cos^2 θ − 1) and the fact that a meridian ring covers θ ∈ [0,π] twice)\n  Q20 = nQ √5/(8√π).\n- Evaluating on the equator (θ = π/2, Y20 = −√(5/16π)) gives\n  V(r,π/2) = (1/4πϵ0)[ (nQ)/r − (nQ R^2)/(8 r^3) ] + O((R/r)^4).\n\nRoute B: Cartesian quadrupole tensor (explicit and compact)\n- For a single great-circle ring of radius R in the xz-plane with line density λ = Q/(2πR), the traceless quadrupole tensor Q̃ij = ∮ λ(3 x_i x_j − r^2 δij) dl evaluates to\n  Q̃xx = Q̃zz = πλ R^3 = (Q/2) R^2,  Q̃yy = −2πλ R^3 = −Q R^2.\n- Average this tensor over n rings uniformly rotated about z; the result is axially symmetric with\n  Q̃xx = Q̃yy = −(nQ/4) R^2,  Q̃zz = (nQ/2) R^2,\n  which is traceless as required.\n- The far-field quadrupole potential is Vquad(r) = (1/8πϵ0)(Q̃ij n_i n_j)/r^3, where n = r̂. On the equator along x (so n = x̂), Vquad = (1/8πϵ0)(Q̃xx)/r^3 = − nQ R^2/(32πϵ0 r^3).\n- Adding the monopole Vmon = (1/4πϵ0)(nQ)/r reproduces\n  V(r,π/2) = (1/4πϵ0)[ (nQ)/r − (nQ R^2)/(8 r^3) ] + O((R/r)^4).\n\nBoth routes agree and fix the coefficient of the 1/r^3 term.\n\n3.3) Central potential for the test charge and definitions\n- The test charge is −q (q > 0).

Problem Analysis\n- A uniform thin rod AB (mass m, length l2) is attached at its upper end B to a fixed point O via a massless inextensible string of length l1. Initially both are vertical and at rest; motion remains planar.\n- At a general instant: the string makes angle θ1 with the vertical; the rod makes angle θ2 with the vertical. The string rotates about O with angular velocity ω1, and the rod rotates about its center of mass G with angular velocity ω2.\n- We are asked to find the angular acceleration α2 of the rod about its center of mass, expressed solely in terms of the given quantities (θ1, θ2, ω1, ω2, l1, l2, m if needed) and g.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use a Lagrangian formulation with generalized coordinates q = [θ1, θ2]. This eliminates string tension automatically and delivers two coupled equations for θ1 and θ2.\n- Kinematics: The rod’s center of mass G has position r_G = l1 u1 + (l2/2) u2 with u1 = (sinθ1, cosθ1), u2 = (sinθ2, cosθ2), measured from the vertical downward. Define Δ = θ1 − θ2 for compactness.\n- Dynamics: The kinetic energy T consists of translational motion of G plus rotation of the rod about G (with I_G = (1/12) m l2^2). The potential energy V arises from gravity, V = − m g (vertical-down component of G) = − m g [ l1 cosθ1 + (l2/2) cosθ2 ].\n- Apply the Euler–Lagrange equations for θ1 and θ2 to obtain two linear equations in α1 and α2. Eliminate α1 to get α2 explicitly.\n- Cross-checks:\n  - When Δ = 0 and ω1 = ω2, the assembly moves as if string and rod are collinear; the relative spin α2 must vanish.\n  - For θ1 = 0, ω1 = ω2 = 0, a small positive θ2 should produce a clockwise (negative) α2 (restoring effect of gravity), fixing the sign of the gravity term.\n\n3.

Problem Analysis\n- We have a thin elliptical plate (semi-axes A and B, A > B) whose surface mass density, expressed in polar coordinates (r, φ) with the origin at a focus F and polar axis pointing toward the nearest vertex, is σ = σ0 (1 + e cos φ)^3, where e is the ellipse eccentricity.\n- The plate stands on a sufficiently rough horizontal tabletop, with its motion constrained to the vertical plane (no slipping at the contact).\n- It is released from rest when its major axis is vertical. We are asked to find the angular acceleration β when the major axis becomes horizontal.\n\nKey physical point: The plate rolls without slipping on its lower edge in a vertical plane. At any instant, the contact point with the table is at rest; however, the proper dynamics requires using the angular momentum balance about the fixed ground contact point together with the no-slip constraint.\n\n2. Approach\n- Compute the plate’s mass M, center of mass (CM) location, and moment of inertia about the focus I_F using focus-centered polar coordinates and the given σ.\n- Show that the CM coincides exactly with the focus F. This is the crucial simplification implied by the special σ ∝ (1 + e cos φ)^3.\n- Use planar rigid-body dynamics for rolling without slipping in a vertical plane. At an instant when the major axis is horizontal, the contact point is the bottom point (0, −B) of the ellipse. Taking moments about the instantaneous ground contact point O and using the no-slip acceleration constraint eliminates unknown contact forces and yields a clean formula:\n  ΣM_O = I_F β + M R^2 β, where R is the distance from CM to the contact point.\n- Evaluate the gravitational torque about O and the geometric distances (notably R = A and the focus offset c = √(A^2 − B^2)), then solve for β.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\n3.1 Geometry and focus-based polar form\n- Let the ellipse have semi-major axis A, semi-minor axis B, eccentricity e = √(1 − B^2/A^2), and focal distance c = eA = √(A^2 − B^2).\n- In focus-centered polar coordinates with the polar axis toward the nearest vertex, the ellipse boundary is\n  r(φ) = p/(1 + e cos φ), where p = B^2/A.\n\n3.2 Mass, center of mass, and I about the focus\n- The area element in polar coordinates is dA = r dr dφ. The density is σ(φ) = σ0 (1 + e cos φ)^3.\n- The mass:\n  M = ∫∫ σ dA\n    = σ0 ∫_0^{2π} (1 + e cos φ)^3 ∫_0^{r(φ)} r dr dφ\n    = σ0 ∫_0^{2π} (1 + e cos φ)^3 [r^2/2]_0^{p/(1 + e cos φ)} dφ\n    = σ0 (p^2/2) ∫_0^{2π} (1 + e cos φ) dφ\n    = σ0 (p^2/2) (2π)\n    = σ0 π p^2\n    = σ0 π B^4/A^2.\n\n- Center of mass relative to the focus F:\n  Let x = r cos φ, y = r sin φ (with origin at F). Then\n  x_CM = (1/M) ∫∫ x σ dA\n        = (1/M) σ0 ∫_0^{2π} cos φ (1 + e cos φ)^3 ∫_0^{r(φ)} r^2 dr dφ\n        = (σ0/M) ∫_0^{2π} cos φ (1 + e cos φ)^3 [r^3/3]_0^{p/(1 + e cos φ)} dφ\n        = (σ0 p^3/(3M)) ∫_0^{2π} cos φ dφ\n        = 0.\n  Similarly y_CM = 0.

The CM is at the focus F = (c, 0) relative to the geometric center; so relative to the contact point O = P, the CM position vector is r = r_O→G = (c, B).\n- Geometric facts:\n  c^2 + B^2 = A^2 ⇒ |r| = R = A.\n- Use angular momentum balance about the instantaneous ground contact point O (which is fixed in the inertial frame at that instant):\n  ΣM_O (out of plane) = dH_O/dt = I_F β + r × M a_G,\n  where a_G is the CM acceleration, and β is the angular acceleration (about the out-of-plane axis).\n- The no-slip constraint gives zero acceleration at the contact point on the ground; for the material point C of the body at O,\n  a_C = 0 = a_G + β k × r_GC − ω × (ω × r_GC),\n  with r_GC = −r and ω about k. Using ω × (ω × r_GC) = −ω^2 r_GC, we get\n  a_G = β k × r − ω^2 r.\n  Then\n  r × M a_G = r × M (β k × r − ω^2 r) = M β (r × (k × r)) − M ω^2 (r × r).\n  But r × r = 0 and r × (k × r) = k |r|^2 (since r ⟂ k), hence\n  r × M a_G = M β |r|^2 k = M β A^2 k.\n- The only external torque about O is from gravity acting at CM:\n  ΣM_O = r × (−M g j) = −M g c k.\n- Therefore,\n  −M g c = I_F β + M A^2 β ⇒ β = − M g c/(I_F + M A^2).\n  The magnitude of the angular acceleration is\n  |β| = (M g c)/(I_F + M A^2).\n- Substitute I_F/M = B^3/(2A) and c = √(A^2 − B^2):\n  |β| = g √(A^2 − B^2) / (A^2 + B^3/(2A)).\n- Direction: The torque −M g c k implies clockwise rotation (taking +x to the right, +y upward), but the problem asks for the angular acceleration magnitude; we report the positive value.\n\nEquivalently, using c = eA:\n  |β| = g e A / (A^2 + B^3/(2A)).\n\nSanity checks:\n- Circular plate (A = B ⇒ e = 0 ⇒ c = 0): β = 0, as expected by symmetry.\n- Highly elongated ellipse (B ≪ A): β ≈ g/A, of the correct order for a slender body pivoting about a point at distance ≈ A.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\beta \\;=\\; \\frac{g\\,\\sqrt{A^{2}-B^{2}}}{\\,A^{2}+\\dfrac{B^{3}}{2A}\\,}\\;=\\;\\frac{g\\,eA}{\\,A^{2}+\\dfrac{B^{3}}{2A}\\,} } \\]"}

However, thermal motion of sodium atoms Doppler-broadens this line, reducing the temporal coherence and thus the fringe contrast with increasing path difference.\n- We are asked to find the position on the screen where the fringes first become “blurred.” The problem gives two notions of blurring:\n  - Objective: vanishing contrast γ = (Imax − Imin)/(Imax + Imin) → 0.\n  - Practical: when the fringe visibility (or perceived contrast/brightness) has dropped sufficiently; the problem suggests a 1/e criterion.\n- Under standard two-beam interference with equal intensities, the fringe contrast equals the modulus of the complex degree of temporal coherence. For a Doppler-broadened (Gaussian) line, the degree of coherence decays as a Gaussian in the delay, never strictly reaching zero; thus a practical threshold such as |γ| = 1/e is used.\n- Geometry: slit separation d (slit width negligible), screen distance L (Fraunhofer/far-field), so path difference Δ ≈ (d/L) y for a point at transverse coordinate y on the screen.\n\n2) Approach\n- Model the Doppler-broadened spectrum of the filtered line as a Gaussian in frequency with standard deviation σν determined by the Maxwellian 1D velocity spread σv = √(kB T/m).\n- Use the Wiener–Khinchin relation: the complex degree of temporal coherence is the normalized Fourier transform of the spectral power density. For a Gaussian spectrum, |γ(τ)| = exp[−(2π σν τ)^2/2].\n- In a Young interferometer with equal intensities from the two slits, the fringe contrast equals |γ(τ)|, where τ = Δ/c is the time delay corresponding to path difference Δ.\n- Use the 1/e blurring criterion: |γ(τ)| = 1/e to define the first-blur path difference Δ1/e and hence the first-blur position yblur via Δ ≈ (d/L) y.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep A: Doppler-broadened spectrum and its width\n- For atoms with velocity component vz along the line of sight, the emitted frequency shifts by ν = ν0 (1 + vz/c) to first order. If vz is Maxwellian with variance ⟨v_z^2⟩ = kB T/m, then the frequency distribution is Gaussian with standard deviation\n  σν = ν0 σv / c = ν0 c^{-1} √(kB T/m).\n- We take the normalized spectral power density to be\n  S(ν) ∝ exp[−(ν − ν0)^2/(2 σν^2)].\n\nStep B: Degree of temporal coherence for a Gaussian spectrum\n- The (normalized) complex degree of temporal coherence is the Fourier transform of the normalized spectrum:\n  γ12(τ) = ∫ S(ν) e^{i 2π ν τ} dν / ∫ S(ν) dν = e^{i 2π ν0 τ} exp[−(2π σν τ)^2/2].\n- Hence its magnitude (which equals the fringe visibility for equal intensities) is\n  |γ12(τ)| = exp[−(2π σν τ)^2/2].\n\nStep C: Time delay τ versus screen coordinate y\n- In the Fraunhofer regime (L ≫ d) and for small angles, the path difference between the two slits at a point displaced by y on the screen is\n  Δ ≈ d sin θ ≈ d (y/L).\n- The corresponding time delay is τ = Δ/c ≈ (d y)/(c L).\n\nStep D: Blurring criterion and solution for Δ and y\n- Use the 1/e visibility criterion:\n  |γ12(τ)| = exp[−(2π σν τ)^2/2] = 1/e.\n  This gives\n  (2π σν τ)^2/2 = 1  ⇒  τ = 1/(√2 π σν).\n- Convert to a path difference:\n  Δ1/e = c τ = c/(√2 π σν).\n- Substitute σν = ν0 c^{-1} √(kB T/m), with ν0 = c/λ1:\n  Δ1/e = c / (√2 π ν0 c^{-1} √(kB T/m)) = (c^2)/(√2 π ν0) √(m/(kB T))\n        = (c^2)/(√2 π (c/λ1)) √(m/(kB T))\n        = (c λ1)/(√2 π) √(m/(kB T)).\n- Map path difference to screen position via Δ ≈ (d/L) y:\n  yblur = (L/d) Δ1/e = (L/d) (c λ1)/(√2 π) √(m/(kB T)).\n\n4) Remarks and consistency checks\n- Units: √(m/(kB T)) has units s/m; multiplying by c λ1 gives meters; then multiplying by L/d (dimensionless) yields meters, as required.\n- Physical behavior:\n  - Higher temperature T increases Doppler width, reducing coherence length and moving the blur closer to the center (yblur ∝ 1/√T).\n  - Heavier atoms increase coherence (yblur ∝ √m).\n  - Larger slit separation d increases the path difference growth rate with y, so blurring occurs at smaller y (yblur ∝ 1/d).\n- The exact vanishing of contrast (γ = 0) does not occur for a Gaussian spectrum; hence a practical 1/e criterion is appropriate. The additional “brightness” statement in the prompt is effectively encoded here by adopting the 1/e visibility threshold.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,y_{\\text{blur}} \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{L}{d}\\,\\frac{c\\,\\lambda_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k_{B}T}}\\,} \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We have two identical uniformly charged rings (each total charge Q0, radius R) located at z = +l and z = −l, both perpendicular to the z-axis. A point particle of charge −q (with q > 0) and mass m is at the origin.\n- The charges on the rings rotate rigidly about the z-axis at angular velocity Ω, producing a magnetic field along z. We ignore relativistic and retardation effects, so the electric field is that of the static charge distribution, and the magnetic field arises from the steady currents of the rotating rings.\n- Goal: Find the minimum Ω such that the particle is stably trapped (small oscillations) in both axial (z) and radial (r) directions.\n\nKey physical ideas:\n- The static electric field of the rings near the origin is quadrupolar. For a negative charge, axial confinement requires the on-axis curvature of the electric potential to have the correct sign (φzz < 0).\n- By Laplace’s equation, this implies radial anti-confinement (saddle potential). Radial stability must be provided by the magnetic field from the rotating rings, as in a Penning trap.\n- The standard Penning-trap stability condition is ωc^2 > 2 ωz^2, where ωc is the cyclotron frequency and ωz is the axial small-oscillation frequency from the electrostatic potential.\n\n2. Approach\n- Compute the electrostatic potential on the axis from the two rings, expand about z = 0, and find the second derivative φzz(0). This gives the axial curvature and determines the axial small-oscillation frequency ωz.\n- Use Laplace’s equation to relate the radial curvature to φzz (showing the saddle nature).\n- Compute the magnetic field at the origin from the two co-rotating charged rings by treating each rotating ring as a current loop with current I = Q0 Ω/(2π). Sum their on-axis fields to get Bz at the origin, and hence the cyclotron frequency ωc = qB/m.\n- Apply the Penning-trap radial stability condition ωc^2 > 2 ωz^2. Solve for the threshold Ωmin that saturates this inequality. Also require axial stability φzz < 0, which imposes a geometric constraint on R and l.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\n3.1 Electrostatic potential and axial curvature at the origin\n- On the symmetry axis (r = 0), the potential from a uniformly charged ring of total charge Q0, radius R, centered at z = z0 is\n  φring(z; z0) = (1 / 4π ε0) Q0 / √[R^2 + (z − z0)^2].\n- For rings at z0 = +l and z0 = −l, the on-axis potential is\n  φ(z) = (1 / 4π ε0) [ Q0 / √(R^2 + (z − l)^2) + Q0 / √(R^2 + (z + l)^2) ].\n\nDifferentiate twice with respect to z. Using d^2/du^2 (R^2 + u^2)^(−1/2) = (−R^2 + 2u^2) / (R^2 + u^2)^(5/2) and u = z ∓ l, at z = 0 we obtain\n  φzz(0) = (1 / 4π ε0) 2Q0 (2l^2 − R^2) / (R^2 + l^2)^(5/2).\n\nAxial equation of motion for the particle of charge −q:\n- The electric field is Ez = −∂φ/∂z, so the force is Fz = (−q) Ez = q ∂φ/∂z.\n- Linearizing near z = 0: m z¨ = q φzz(0) z.\n\nAxial stability requires a restoring force, i.e., φzz(0) < 0 ⇒ R^2 > 2 l^2.\n\nThen the axial small-oscillation frequency is\n  ωz^2 = −(q/m) φzz(0)\n        = (q Q0 / (2π ε0 m)) (R^2 − 2l^2) / (R^2 + l^2)^(5/2).\n\n3.2 Radial curvature from Laplace’s equation\nNear the origin, write the potential up to quadratic order as\n  φ(r, z) ≈ φ0 + (1/2) α r^2 + (1/2) φzz z^2\nwith axisymmetry. Laplace’s equation in cylindrical coordinates at the origin gives\n  ∇^2φ = (∂^2φ/∂r^2) + (1/r)(∂φ/∂r) + (∂^2φ/∂z^2) → α + α + φzz = 0\n⇒ α = −φzz / 2.\n\nWith φzz < 0 for axial stability, we have α > 0. Thus the electric potential is a saddle: it focuses axially and defocuses radially for the negative charge. Magnetic confinement is therefore required in the radial plane.\n\n3.3 Magnetic field from the co-rotating charged rings\n- Each ring carries current I = Q0 Ω / (2π).\n- The on-axis magnetic field from a single current loop of radius R at distance l from the observation point is\n  Bz, one ring = μ0 I R^2 / [2 (R^2 + l^2)^(3/2)].\n- With both rings co-rotating so that their dipole moments are aligned, the fields add at the origin:\n  Bz(0) = μ0 I R^2 / (R^2 + l^2)^(3/2)\n        = μ0 Q0 Ω R^2 / [2π (R^2 + l^2)^(3/2)].\n\nCyclotron frequency (magnitude) for the particle is\n  ωc = q Bz(0) / m\n     = q μ0 Q0 Ω R^2 / [2π m (R^2 + l^2)^(3/2)].\n\n3.4 Radial stability condition (Penning trap criterion)\nThe linearized equations of motion in the xy-plane are\n  x¨ = (q α / m) x − ωc y˙,   y¨ = (q α / m) y + ωc x˙,\nwith q α / m = −(q φzz)/(2m) = ωz^2 / 2 (using α = −φzz/2).\n\nThe two eigenfrequencies (modified cyclotron and magnetron) are\n  ω± = (1/2) [ ωc ± √(ωc^2 − 2 ωz^2) ].\nFor real ω± and thus radial stability, we need\n  ωc^2 > 2 ωz^2.\n\n3.5 Minimum rotation rate Ωmin\nImpose the threshold ωc^2 = 2 ωz^2 with the expressions above.\n\n- ωz^2 = (q Q0 / (2π ε0 m)) (R^2 − 2l^2) / (R^2 + l^2)^(5/2).\n- ωc = q μ0 Q0 Ω R^2 / [2π m (R^2 + l^2)^(3/2)].\n\nSet ωc^2 = 2 ωz^2 and solve for Ω:\n\n[ q μ0 Q0 Ω R^2 / (2π m (R^2 + l^2)^(3/2)) ]^2\n= 2 [ q Q0 / (2π ε0 m) ] [ (R^2 − 2l^2) / (R^2 + l^2)^(5/2) ].\n\nThis yields\n  Ω^2 = [ 4π m / (ε0 μ0^2 q Q0) ] × [ (R^2 − 2l^2) (R^2 + l^2)^(1/2) / R^4 ].\n\nTherefore,\n  Ωmin = √[ 4π m / (ε0 μ0^2 q Q0) ] × (R^2 + l^2)^(1/4) √(R^2 − 2l^2) / R^2.\n\nEquivalently (algebraically identical),\n  Ωmin = (2π m / (q μ0 Q0 R^2)) × √[ (q Q0) / (π ε0 m) ] × (R^2 + l^2)^(1/4) √(R^2 − 2l^2).\n\n3.6 Conditions for full stability\n- Axial stability requires R^2 > 2 l^2 (otherwise φzz > 0 and z-motion is unstable for a negative charge).\n- Given R^2 > 2 l^2, the minimal rotation rate to ensure radial stability is Ωmin above; any Ω > Ωmin gives stable small oscillations in all directions.\n- The two rings must co-rotate so their magnetic fields add along the same axial direction.\n\n4.

Every edge has resistance r except the specific edge BC, which has resistance 2r. We are asked to find the equivalent resistance between the adjacent vertices B and C.\n\n2) Approach\n- Step A: First compute the effective resistance between adjacent vertices in the uniform network where all 30 edges are r. Call this R_adj(uniform).\n  - Use Foster’s First Theorem on an edge-transitive graph: with unit resistors, the sum of effective resistances across all edges equals N − 1. Because all edges are equivalent, each edge has the same effective resistance (N − 1)/E. With resistors of value r, this scales by r.\n  - Cross-check this value via planar duality (dodecahedron ↔ icosahedron), using the well-known primal–dual edge identity.\n- Step B: View the two-terminal network between B and C as a parallel combination of the direct edge BC and “the rest of the network” (the dodecahedron with the BC edge deleted), because all other paths from B to C lie in parallel with the direct edge.\n  - In the uniform network (BC = r), R_adj(uniform) equals r in parallel with R_rest (the equivalent between B and C with the BC edge removed). Solve for R_rest.\n- Step C: Replace the BC edge by 2r and recombine in parallel with the same R_rest to get the desired R_BC.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n- Preliminaries:\n  - Dodecahedron: N = 20 vertices, E = 30 edges, edge-transitive, 3-regular.\n  - Parallel combination: R1 || R2 satisfies 1/(R1 || R2) = 1/R1 + 1/R2.\n\nA. Effective resistance across an edge in the uniform dodecahedron\n- Foster’s First Theorem (unit resistors): For a connected network with N vertices and E edges,\n  sum over edges e of R_eff(e) = N − 1.\n  Since the dodecahedron is edge-transitive, each edge has the same effective resistance R_edge(unit), so:\n  E × R_edge(unit) = N − 1\n  ⇒ R_edge(unit) = (N − 1)/E = (20 − 1)/30 = 19/30.\n- With each physical resistor equal to r (instead of 1), the effective resistance scales linearly:\n  R_adj(uniform) = (19/30) r.\n\nCross-check via planar duality:\n- The planar dual of the dodecahedron is the icosahedron (N_dual = 12, E_dual = 30, 5-regular).\n- For a planar network with identical resistors r on edges and its dual network with identical resistors r on dual edges, the effective resistances across a primal edge and its dual satisfy:\n  R_primal_edge + R_dual_edge = r.\n- By Foster on the icosahedron with unit resistors:\n  R_dual(unit) = (N_dual − 1)/E_dual = (12 − 1)/30 = 11/30.\n  With resistors r, R_dual = (11/30) r.\n- Therefore R_primal_edge = r − R_dual = r − (11/30) r = (19/30) r, confirming the Foster result.\n\nB. Extract the “rest-of-network” seen between B and C after deleting edge BC\n- In the uniform dodecahedron (BC = r), the effective resistance between B and C is the parallel of the direct edge r and the rest of the network with the BC edge removed:\n  R_adj(uniform) = r || R_rest.\n  Using 1/(R1 || R2) = 1/R1 + 1/R2,\n  1/R_adj(uniform) = 1/r + 1/R_rest.\n- Substitute R_adj(uniform) = (19/30) r and solve for R_rest:\n  1/[(19/30) r] = 1/r + 1/R_rest\n  ⇒ 30/(19 r) = 1/r + 1/R_rest\n  ⇒ 1/R_rest = 30/(19 r) − 1/r = (30 − 19)/(19 r) = 11/(19 r)\n  ⇒ R_rest = (19/11) r.\n\nC. Replace BC by 2r and recombine in parallel\n- In the modified network, the total resistance between B and C is:\n  R_BC = (2r) || R_rest = (2r) || ((19/11) r).\n- Compute the parallel combination:\n  R_BC = [ (2r) × ((19/11) r) ] / [ (2r) + ((19/11) r) ]\n       = [ (38/11) r^2 ] / [ (22/11 + 19/11) r ]\n       = [ (38/11) r^2 ] / [ (41/11) r ]\n       = (38/41) r.\n\nSanity checks:\n- Monotonicity (Rayleigh): Increasing BC from r to 2r should increase the effective resistance. Indeed, (19/30) r ≈ 0.633 r < (38/41) r ≈ 0.927 r.\n- Upper bound: R_BC must be less than 2r because alternative paths exist in parallel; 0.927 r < 2r is satisfied.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{38}{41}\\,r} \\]"}

In the numerator, keep terms through first order in ε'':\n(ε' + i ε'')(ε1 + ε' - i ε'') = ε'(ε1 + ε') + i ε''(ε1 + ε') - i ε' ε'' + O[(ε'')^2]\n= ε'(ε1 + ε') + i ε'' ε1 + O[(ε'')^2].\n\nThus,\nF' = ε1 ε' / (ε1 + ε'), \nF'' = ε1^2 ε'' / (ε1 + ε')^2,\nto first order in ε''.\n\nNote: For an SPP to exist with real propagation constant, we require ε' < −ε1 so that F' > 0.\n\nStep 4: Small-loss square-root expansion for nSPP\nLet F = A + i B with\nA = F' = ε1 ε' / (ε1 + ε'), \nB = F'' = ε1^2 ε'' / (ε1 + ε')^2.\n\nFor |B| ≪ |A|, expand:\nsqrt(A + i B) ≈ sqrt(A) + i B / [2 sqrt(A)].\n\nTherefore,\nRe(nSPP) ≈ sqrt(A) = sqrt[ ε1 ε' / (ε1 + ε') ],\nIm(nSPP) ≈ B / [2 sqrt(A)] = [ε1^2 ε''] / [2 (ε1 + ε')^2 sqrt{ε1 ε' / (ε1 + ε')} ].\n\nThe key point: to first order in ε'', Re(nSPP) is unchanged from the lossless value; the first-order effect of loss only appears in Im(nSPP), i.e., attenuation.\n\nStep 5: SPP wavelength to lowest order\nThe SPP wavelength along x is\nλ = λ0 / Re(nSPP) ≈ λ0 / sqrt(A)\n= λ0 sqrt( (ε1 + ε') / (ε1 ε') ).\n\nSubstitute back ε' = ε21:\nλ ≈ λ0 sqrt( (ε1 + ε21) / (ε1 ε21) ).\n\nThis expression is valid in the SPP existence regime ε21 < −ε1 and is accurate to lowest order in ε22; linear corrections in ε22 do not alter λ, entering only at second order.\n\nRemark on attenuation (optional context):\nIm(kx) = k0 Im(nSPP) ≈ k0 [ ε1^2 ε22 / (2 (ε1 + ε21)^2 sqrt{ε1 ε21 / (ε1 + ε21)} ) ],\nwhich sets the propagation length.

The charges execute uniform circular motion about the axis (the z-axis) with angular velocity ω, so each charge at radius r has tangential speed v⊥(r) = ω r and radial (centripetal) acceleration a⊥(r) = ω² r.\n- We switch to a frame S′ moving along the axis with speed β c relative to S (β ∈ [0,1)). In S′, the charges now have both an axial velocity component and the same circular motion seen with altered kinematics due to Lorentz transformation.\n- Using the relativistic Liénard (generalized Larmor) formula for a point charge, we must compute directly the total radiated power per unit length in S′ by summing incoherent single-particle powers across the cross-section.\n- We must not use global energy/power transformation formulas between frames; instead we compute P′ by:\n  a) transforming the velocity and acceleration of each charge to S′,\n  b) inserting them into the Liénard formula for instantaneous power,\n  c) summing over all charges per unit length using the S′ number density.\n\n2) Approach\n- Key observation: In S, each particle’s velocity is purely transverse (xy-plane), and the acceleration is purely radial in the xy-plane, so a ⟂ v. Under a boost along z, the particle acquires an axial velocity component v′∥ = −β c while its transverse components are modified by standard velocity/acceleration transformation laws. Critically, the acceleration remains perpendicular to the total velocity in S′: it is still radial in the xy-plane, orthogonal to both the tangential and axial components of v′. This greatly simplifies the Liénard formula.\n- We compute the per-charge power P′(r) in S′ using:\n  P = (γ^6 q^2 / 6π ε0 c^3) [ a^2 − (v × a)^2 / c^2 ].\n  When a ⟂ v, this reduces to P = (q^2 γ^4 a^2) / (6π ε0 c^3).\n- We then integrate P′(r) over the cross-section, using the S′ number density n′ and area element 2π r dr, to obtain the power per unit length dP′/dz′.\n- The number density transforms as ρ′ = γB ρ for a boost along z when Jz = 0 in S. Thus n′ = γB n, where γB = 1/√(1 − β^2).\n- The integral over r can be evaluated in closed form after substituting x = ω r / c, leading to a compact expression in terms of α = ω R / c.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\n3.1 Kinematics in S and S′\n- In S (lab frame):\n  v⊥(r) = ω r, a⊥(r) = ω^2 r, with a ⟂ v.\n  Define the rotational Lorentz factor\n  γrot(r) = 1 / √(1 − (ω r / c)^2).\n- Boost to S′ with speed β c along z. Standard velocity addition (boost along z) for a particle with u∥ = 0, u⊥ = ω r gives:\n  v′∥ = −β c,\n  v′⊥ = v⊥ / γB = (ω r)/γB,\n  where γB = 1/√(1 − β^2).\n  The total Lorentz factor in S′ satisfies\n  γ′ = 1 / √(1 − v′2/c^2) = γB γrot(r).\n- Acceleration transformation for components with u∥ = 0 and a∥ = 0 (and u · a = 0, as in uniform circular motion) yields:\n  a′∥ = 0,\n  a′⊥ = a⊥ / γB^2 = (ω^2 r) / γB^2.\n  Thus in S′ the acceleration remains purely radial in the xy-plane.\n\n3.2 Per-charge radiated power in S′\n- Liénard power (instantaneous) for a particle with velocity v′ and acceleration a′:\n  P′ = (γ′^6 q^2 / 6π ε0 c^3) [ a′2 − (v′ × a′)^2 / c^2 ].\n- Because a′ ⟂ v′ (radial vs. tangential+axial), we have\n  (v′ × a′)^2 = v′2 a′2,\n  hence the bracket becomes a′2 (1 − v′2/c^2) = a′2 / γ′2.\n  Therefore:\n  P′(r) = (q^2 / 6π ε0 c^3) γ′^4 a′2.\n- Substitute γ′ = γB γrot(r) and a′ = a⊥/γB^2 = ω^2 r / γB^2:\n  P′(r) = (q^2 / 6π ε0 c^3) (γB^4 γrot^4) (ω^4 r^2 / γB^4)\n         = (q^2 / 6π ε0 c^3) γrot(r)^4 ω^4 r^2.\n- Remarkably, the per-charge power is independent of the boost β. It is exactly the same function of r as in S. The β-dependence will enter only through the density n′ in S′.\n\n3.3 Number density in S′ and summation over charges\n- In S there is no axial current (Jz = 0), so under a boost along z the charge density transforms as ρ′ = γB ρ. Therefore the number density is n′ = γB n.\n- The number of charges per unit z′-length in an annulus of radius r and thickness dr is\n  dN/dz′ = n′ (area of annulus) = n′ 2π r dr.\n- Incoherent emission allows summing powers:\n  dP′/dz′ = ∫₀^R (dN/dz′) P′(r)\n           = ∫₀^R [n′ 2π r dr] [(q^2 / 6π ε0 c^3) γrot^4 ω^4 r^2].\n  Simplify constants:\n  dP′/dz′ = n′ (q^2 ω^4 / 3 ε0 c^3) ∫₀^R r^3 [1 − (ω r / c)^2]^{-2} dr.\n  Using n′ = γB n:\n  dP′/dz′ = γB n (q^2 ω^4 / 3 ε0 c^3) ∫₀^R r^3 [1 − (ω r / c)^2]^{-2} dr.\n\n3.4 Evaluate the radial integral\n- Let x ≡ (ω r)/c. Then r = (c/ω) x, dr = (c/ω) dx, and r^3 dr = (c^4/ω^4) x^3 dx. The upper limit becomes α ≡ ω R / c (< 1 for physical speeds).\n  I ≡ ∫₀^R r^3 [1 − (ω r / c)^2]^{-2} dr\n    = (c^4/ω^4) ∫₀^α x^3 (1 − x^2)^{-2} dx.\n- Compute the dimensionless integral:\n  ∫ x^3/(1 − x^2)^2 dx. Let t = x^2 ⇒ dt = 2x dx ⇒ x^3 dx = (t/2) dt. Then\n  ∫ x^3/(1 − x^2)^2 dx = (1/2) ∫ t/(1 − t)^2 dt.\n  With y = 1 − t (dt = −dy), this becomes\n  (1/2) ∫ [t/(1 − t)^2] dt = (1/2) ∫ [−(1/y^2) + (1/y)] dy\n                            = (1/2) [1/y + ln y] + C\n                            = (1/2) [1/(1 − t) + ln(1 − t)] + C\n                            = (1/2) [1/(1 − x^2) + ln(1 − x^2)] + C.\n- Thus the definite integral from 0 to α is\n  ∫₀^α x^3/(1 − x^2)^2 dx = (1/2) [ 1/(1 − α^2) + ln(1 − α^2) − 1 ].\n- Therefore\n  I = (c^4/ω^4) (1/2) [ 1/(1 − α^2) + ln(1 − α^2) − 1 ].\n\n3.5 Assemble the result\n- Insert I into dP′/dz′:\n  dP′/dz′ = γB n (q^2 ω^4 / 3 ε0 c^3) × (c^4/ω^4) × (1/2) [ 1/(1 − α^2) + ln(1 − α^2) − 1 ].\n  Simplify:\n  dP′/dz′ = γB n (q^2 c / 6 ε0) [ 1/(1 − α^2) + ln(1 − α^2) − 1 ],\n  where α = ω R / c and γB = 1/√(1 − β^2).\n\n3.6 Checks and limiting cases\n- Nonrelativistic edge speed (α ≪ 1): ln(1 − α^2) ≈ −α^2 − α^4/2, 1/(1 − α^2) ≈ 1 + α^2 + α^4.\n  Bracket ≈ (1 + α^2 + α^4) + (−α^2 − α^4/2) − 1 = α^4/2.\n  Hence dP′/dz′ ≈ γB n (q^2 c / 6 ε0) (α^4/2) = γB n q^2 ω^4 R^4 / (12 ε0 c^3),\n  which equals γB times the textbook nonrelativistic result per unit length in S (consistent because n′ = γB n).\n- As α → 1− (edge speed → c), the bracket diverges, reflecting the divergence of power as the rim approaches light speed.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\frac{dP'}{dz'} \\;=\\; \\gamma_B\\, n\\, \\frac{q^{2} c}{6\\,\\varepsilon_{0}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega R}{c}\\right)^{2}} \\;+\\; \\ln\\!\\Big(1 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega R}{c}\\right)^{2}\\Big) \\;-\\; 1 \\right],\\quad \\gamma_B=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^{2}}} } \\]"}

We are to find the period T1 of small oscillations, assuming the equilibrium is stable.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use the energy method for small oscillations. The interaction energy between the fixed dipole (moment m along the laboratory z-axis) and the loop’s field is U(φ) = − m Bz,lab(φ), where Bz,lab is the component of the loop’s magnetic field at the dipole location along the dipole’s fixed direction (lab z).\n- For small tilt φ about a diameter, the dipole’s fixed lab position (0, 0, h) corresponds in the loop’s co-rotating frame to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, z) ≈ (h sin φ, h cos φ) ≈ (h φ, h − h φ^2/2).\n- Near the loop axis, the off-axis field of any axisymmetric, source-free magnetic field is determined by the axial field Baxis(z) and its derivatives:\n  - Bz(ρ, z) = Baxis(z) − (ρ^2/4) Baxis''(z) + O(ρ^4)\n  - Bρ(ρ, z) = − (ρ/2) Baxis'(z) + O(ρ^3)\n- The lab-z projection of the field at the dipole becomes Bz,lab(φ) = cos φ Bz(ρ, z) + sin φ Bρ(ρ, z). Expanding to second order in φ yields an effective torsional stiffness κ for the loop-dipole interaction: κ = ∂^2U/∂φ^2|0 = − m d^2Bz,lab/dφ^2|0.\n- For a circular loop, Baxis(z) is known in closed form: Baxis(z) = μ0 I R^2 / [2 (R^2 + z^2)^(3/2)]. Computing its derivatives and assembling the above expansion yields κ in closed form, hence the small-oscillation period T1 = 2π sqrt(Id/κ), where Id = (1/2) M R^2 is the loop’s moment of inertia about a diameter.\n\nWe will also verify the far-separation limit h ≫ R by modeling the loop as a magnetic dipole, which gives a simple asymptotic expression.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Geometry and projection\n- Choose the initial loop plane as the xy-plane with loop axis along ẑ. The loop is tilted by a small angle φ about the x-axis; the dipole remains fixed at lab coordinates (0, 0, h) with moment m ẑ.\n- In the loop’s instantaneously co-rotating frame, the dipole position is (ρ, z) ≈ (h sin φ, h cos φ) = (h φ, h − (h φ^2)/2).\n- The component of the loop’s magnetic field along the dipole direction (lab z) is\n  Bz,lab(φ) = cos φ Bz(ρ, z) + sin φ Bρ(ρ, z).\n\nStep 2: Near-axis expansion of the field\nIn any source-free, axisymmetric region,\n- Bz(ρ, z) = Baxis(z) − (ρ^2/4) Baxis''(z) + O(ρ^4),\n- Bρ(ρ, z) = − (ρ/2) Baxis'(z) + O(ρ^3),\nwhere primes denote d/dz and Baxis is the on-axis field.\n\nFor a circular loop of radius R carrying current I,\nBaxis(z) = μ0 I R^2 / [2 (R^2 + z^2)^(3/2)].\n\nIts first two derivatives are\n- Baxis'(z) = d/dz [ μ0 I R^2 / 2 · (R^2 + z^2)^(-3/2) ]\n            = − (3/2) μ0 I R^2 z (R^2 + z^2)^(-5/2),\n- Baxis''(z) = μ0 I R^2 / 2 [ −3 (R^2 + z^2)^(-5/2) + 15 z^2 (R^2 + z^2)^(-7/2) ].\n\nStep 3: Small-angle expansion of Bz,lab(φ)\nUse cos φ ≈ 1 − φ^2/2, sin φ ≈ φ; ρ = h φ; z = h − (h φ^2)/2. Expanding to O(φ^2),\n- Expand Baxis(z) about z = h: Baxis(z) ≈ B − (h/2) B' φ^2, where B, B', B'' denote Baxis and its derivatives evaluated at z = h.\n- Then\n  Bz(ρ, z) ≈ [B − (h/2) B' φ^2] − (h^2 φ^2/4) B'',\n  Bρ(ρ, z) ≈ − (h φ/2) B'.\n- Therefore\n  Bz,lab(φ) = cos φ Bz + sin φ Bρ\n             ≈ (1 − φ^2/2)[B − (h/2) B' φ^2 − (h^2 φ^2/4) B''] + φ [ − (h φ/2) B' ].\nKeeping terms through O(φ^2) and dropping O(φ^4),\n  Bz,lab(φ) ≈ B + φ^2 [ − (1/2) B − h B' − (h^2/4) B'' ].\n\nThus\nd^2 Bz,lab/dφ^2|0 = − [ B + 2 h B' + (h^2/2) B'' ].\n\nStep 4: Torsional stiffness κ and stability\nInteraction energy: U(φ) = − m Bz,lab(φ) ⇒ κ = ∂^2U/∂φ^2|0 = − m d^2 Bz,lab/dφ^2|0,\nso\nκ = m [ B + 2 h B' + (h^2/2) B'' ] evaluated at z = h.\n\nInsert B, B', B'' for the loop:\nLet A = μ0 I R^2 / 2 and S = R^2 + h^2. Then\n- B = A S^(-3/2),\n- B' = − (3/2) A h S^(-5/2),\n- B'' = A [ −3 S^(-5/2) + 15 h^2 S^(-7/2) ].\n\nCompute the combination C(h) = B + 2 h B' + (h^2/2) B'':\nC(h) = A [ R^4 − (11/2) R^2 h^2 + h^4 ] / S^(7/2)\n     = (A/2) [ 2(R^4 + h^4) − 11 R^2 h^2 ] / S^(7/2).\n\nTherefore\nκ = m C(h)\n  = μ0 m I R^2 [ 2(R^4 + h^4) − 11 R^2 h^2 ] / [ 4 (R^2 + h^2)^(7/2) ].\n\nStability requires κ > 0:\n2(R^4 + h^4) − 11 R^2 h^2 > 0.\nEquivalently, in terms of x = h^2/R^2: 2 x^2 − 11 x + 2 > 0, i.e., x < (11 − √105)/4 ≈ 0.188 or x > (11 + √105)/4 ≈ 5.312. The problem states parameters satisfy stability.\n\nStep 5: Period of small oscillations\nThe loop’s moment of inertia about a diameter is Id = (1/2) M R^2 (thin rigid hoop).\nThe small-angle equation is Id φ¨ + κ φ = 0, hence\nT1 = 2π sqrt(Id/κ)\n   = 2π sqrt( (1/2) M R^2 / κ ).\n\nUsing the κ found above,\nT1 = 2π sqrt{ 2 M (R^2 + h^2)^(7/2) / [ μ0 m I ( 2(R^4 + h^4) − 11 R^2 h^2 ) ] }.\n\nStep 6: Far-separation check (h ≫ R)\nIf h ≫ R, then (R^2 + h^2)^(7/2) ≈ h^7 and 2(R^4 + h^4) − 11 R^2 h^2 ≈ 2 h^4. Thus\nκ ≈ μ0 m I R^2 / (2 h^3),\nT1 ≈ 2π sqrt( (1/2) M R^2 / [ μ0 m I R^2 / (2 h^3) ] ) = 2π sqrt( M h^3 / (μ0 m I) ),\nwhich coincides with the simple dipole–dipole interaction approximation.\n\n4.

{"id": "MECHANICS/69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

Problem Analysis\n- We have a tight circular binary with component masses M_S (Saka) and M_J (Juipte) orbiting their center of mass with angular frequency Ω and separation R0. A distant planet (r ≫ R0) moves in their gravitational field.\n- Over one binary orbit, the planet barely moves, so the binary’s rapidly rotating potential can be averaged to an effective, central potential for the planet. The leading correction beyond the monopole term is quadrupolar and scales like 1/r^3.\n- In the pure Kepler potential V0 = −G(M_S+M_J)m/r, the Laplace–Runge–Lenz (LRL) vector B is conserved and points to periapsis. With the correction δV ∝ 1/r^3, B slowly rotates, producing periapsis precession. We are to compute the precession per planetary orbit Δα in terms of M_S, M_J, G, Ω, m, and L (the planet’s orbital angular momentum magnitude).\n\nSection 2. Approach\n- Step A: Describe the binary geometry: express R_S, R_J (orbital radii of S and J about the center of mass) and R0, and relate R0 to Ω using Kepler’s third law for a circular binary.\n- Step B: Compute the time-averaged potential felt by the distant planet via a multipole expansion of −G m M_i/|r − R_i| to second order in R_i/r, and average over the binary’s fast rotation. The dipole term cancels by symmetry; the first nonzero correction is quadrupolar: δV(r) = α/r^3 with α expressed in terms of masses and Ω.\n- Step C: Recall the unperturbed Kepler orbit r(θ) and the conserved LRL vector B0 (with |B0| = G(M_S+M_J) m e).\n- Step D: Treat δV as a small central perturbation. Because the perturbing acceleration is purely radial, the secular change of B over one orbit is ΔB = ∫(δa × L) dt. Evaluate the integral on the unperturbed ellipse. Then use the small-rotation relation Δα ≈ |ΔB|/|B0| to obtain the precession per orbit and substitute α in terms of the binary parameters.\n\nSection 3. Solution Steps\n\nStep A. Binary kinematics and scales\n- Let M_tot ≡ M_S + M_J and μ_b ≡ M_S M_J / M_tot (the reduced mass of the binary).\n- In a circular COM orbit,\n  R_S = (M_J/M_tot) R0,   R_J = (M_S/M_tot) R0,   and   R0 = R_S + R_J.\n- Kepler’s third law for the binary gives\n  Ω^2 = G M_tot / R0^3  ⇒  R0^2 = (G M_tot / Ω^2)^{2/3}.\n\nStep B. Time-averaged effective potential for the distant planet\n- Instantaneous potential from star i at position R_i:\n  V_i = − G m M_i / |r − R_i|.\n  For r ≫ R_i, expand to second order:\n  1/|r − R_i| ≈ 1/r + (R_i · r)/r^3 + [3(R_i · r)^2 − R_i^2 r^2]/(2 r^5) + …\n- Summing over i = S, J:\n  V = − G m ∑_i M_i [ 1/r + (R_i · r)/r^3 + (3(R_i · r)^2 − R_i^2 r^2)/(2 r^5) + … ].\n- The dipole term vanishes because the center of mass is at the origin: ∑_i M_i R_i = 0.\n- Average the quadrupole term over the binary phase (planet nearly fixed over one Ω-period).

Unperturbed Kepler orbit and the LRL vector\n- For V0 = −k m / r with k ≡ G M_tot, the bound orbit is\n  r(θ) = p / (1 + e cos θ),\n  where p = L^2/(m^2 k) and e is the eccentricity (0 < e < 1).\n- The Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector is\n  B = v × L − k m r̂.\n  In the pure Kepler problem (δV = 0), B0 ≡ B is conserved and points toward periapsis; its magnitude is\n  |B0| = k m e = G M_tot m e.\n\nStep D. Secular change of B and periapsis precession\n- The perturbing potential δV = α/r^3 is central, so the perturbing acceleration is radial:\n  δa = −(1/m) ∇(α/r^3) = (3 α)/(m r^4) r̂.\n  Being radial, it exerts no torque: dL/dt = r × m δa = 0 ⇒ L is constant to first order.\n- From the definition of B, the first-order change due to δa is\n  dB/dt = δa × L  ⇒  ΔB = ∮ (δa × L) dt over one unperturbed orbit.\n  With L = m r^2 θ̇ k̂ and r̂ × k̂ = −θ̂,\n  δa × L = (3 α)/(m r^4) r̂ × (m r^2 θ̇ k̂) = − (3 α θ̇)/r^2 θ̂.\n  Hence\n  ΔB = −3 α ∮ θ̂/r^2 dθ.\n- Evaluate the vector integral on the ellipse r(θ) = p/(1 + e cos θ):\n  1/r^2 = (1 + e cos θ)^2 / p^2, and θ̂ = (−sin θ, cos θ).\n  Over 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π,\n  ∮ θ̂ (1 + e cos θ)^2 dθ = 2 e ∮ cos θ θ̂ dθ\n                             = 2 e (0, ∮ cos^2 θ dθ)\n                             = 2 e (0, π) = (0, 2π e).\n  Therefore,\n  ΔB = −3 α (0, 2π e)/p^2 = − (6π α e)/p^2 ŷ.\n- The small precession per orbit is the rotation of the periapsis direction (the direction of B) by\n  Δα ≈ |ΔB|/|B0| = (6π |α| e/p^2)/(k m e) = 6π α m^3 k / L^4,\n  where we dropped the absolute value to retain the sign set by α (α < 0 here gives retrograde precession).\n- Substitute k = G M_tot and α from Step B:\n  Δα = 6π [ − (G m/4) μ_b (G M_tot / Ω^2)^{2/3} ] m^3 (G M_tot) / L^4\n      = − (3π/2) G^2 m^4 μ_b M_tot [ G M_tot / Ω^2 ]^{2/3} / L^4.\n  Using μ_b M_tot = M_S M_J, we obtain the requested expression in the given parameters:\n  Δα = − (3π/2) G^2 m^4 M_S M_J [ G (M_S + M_J)/Ω^2 ]^{2/3} / L^4.\n\nRemarks:\n- The magnitude |Δα| is the advance per orbit; the negative sign indicates a retrograde precession (periapsis regresses) because α < 0 for a positive-mass binary.\n- Validity requires R0 ≪ r and a strong separation of timescales (binary period ≪ planetary orbital period), so that the averaging is justified and the 1/r^3 correction is small.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\Delta\\alpha \\;=\\; -\\,\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\;\\frac{G^{2}\\,m^{4}}{L^{4}}\\;M_{S} M_{J}\\;\\left[\\frac{G\\,(M_{S}+M_{J})}{\\Omega^{2}}\\right]^{\\!2/3} } \\]"}

In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical. This results in no current through the cross-shaped wires in the center.   \n\nOnly the circular arcs perpendicular to the ${\\pmb x}$ direction have current, with the electromotive force given by:\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-\\pi R^{2}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nThus, the current is:\n\n$$\nI={\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2\\pi R\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nThe $\\pmb{\\mathscr{x}}$ component of the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{x}=I S=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{\\vec{B}}\n$$  \n\nIn the rest frame, the magnetic field rotates at an angular velocity of $-\\alpha$ (referring to the angular velocity of the sphere's rotation). Hence, $\\dot{\\vec{B}}=-\\vec{\\omega}\\times\\vec{B}$. In the ground frame, we arrive at a remarkably elegant result:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=\\frac{\\pi\\mathcal{R}^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\vec{\\omega}\\times\\vec{B}\n$$  \n\nThis result is remarkably coincidental and symmetric, allowing us to utilize a simple vector method for mechanical analysis. Following the coordinate system established in the first question:\n\nThe theorem of the motion of the center of mass is:\n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d{\\vec{v}}}{d t}}={\\vec{f}}\n$$  \n\nRotational motion law:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5}m R^{2}\\frac{d\\vec{\\omega}}{d t}=R\\vec{n}\\times\\vec{f}+\\vec{\\mu}\\times\\vec{B}\n$$  \n\nPure rolling constraint:\n\n$$\n\\vec{v}+R\\vec{\\omega}\\times\\vec{n}=0\n$$  \n\nBy taking the cross product with $\\vec{n}$ on both sides of the rotational motion law, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5}m R^{2}\\frac{d\\vec{n}\\times\\vec{\\omega}}{d t}=-R\\vec{f}+\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\vec{n}\\times\\left[\\left(\\vec{B}\\cdot\\vec{\\omega}\\right)\\vec{B}-B^{2}\\vec{\\omega}\\right]\n$$  \n\nNoting that $\\vec{n}\\times\\vec{B}=0$, the second term on the right-hand side of the above equation is omitted.

The wires are electrically connected at their intersections.\n- The sphere’s center is given an initial horizontal speed v0, with initial angular speed matched to pure rolling.\n- Asked: Determine how the speed v(t) evolves subsequently (i.e., the “subsequent change in velocity”).\n\nKey physical effects:\n- Motional EMF is induced in the moving/rotating loops: ε = ∮(u × B)·dl with u the material velocity.\n- Induced currents dissipate energy (Joule heating), extracting kinetic energy and slowing the rolling sphere.\n- The surface is rough enough to maintain rolling without slipping; translational and rotational speeds remain constrained by v = Rω.\n\n2) Approach\n- Use the motional-EMF and Joule heating point of view.\n- Show that the translational part of the motion makes no net contribution to the EMF for a closed loop in uniform B; only rotation matters.\n- Compute the EMF in each loop in terms of angular velocity ω, loop normal ni, and B. For a rigid loop of area A = πR^2, resistance R_loop = 2πRλ, and uniform B = Bb (unit vector b vertical), one finds Ei = AB ω·(ni × b).\n- Treating the three orthogonal loops initially as independent and then using a symmetry/basis-invariance argument (or an equivalent circuit-node analysis) shows the total Joule power is orientation/connection independent and depends only on the component of ω perpendicular to B. For rolling on a horizontal plane with B vertical, ω ⟂ B.\n- Use energy balance: d/dt(1/2 m v^2 + 1/2 I ω^2) = −P_Joule together with the rolling constraint v = Rω and I = (2/5)mR^2 for a solid sphere. Solve the resulting first-order linear ODE dv/dt = −(1/τ_m) v.\n\nCross-check insight:\n- A circuit-network treatment with the loops interconnected at their intersections yields the same total Joule power as the “independent-loops” calculation because the sum of squared EMFs over an orthonormal triad satisfies Σ(ω·(ni × b))^2 = |ω × b|^2, a basis-invariant quantity. Hence the result does not depend on how the wires are interconnected at their crossings.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Kinematics and rolling constraint\n- Let the center-of-mass velocity be v (horizontal) and angular velocity be ω.\n- Pure rolling on a horizontal plane implies v = R|ω| and ω ⟂ v.\n- With B vertical, b ⟂ v and we also have ω ⟂ b (because ω is horizontal for rolling on a horizontal plane).\n\nStep 2: Motional EMF in each loop\n- Velocity of a point on the sphere: u(r) = V_cm + ω × r, with V_cm = v.\n- Motional EMF in a loop: ε = ∮(u × B)·dl.\n- Translational contribution vanishes for a closed loop in uniform B:\n  ∮[(V_cm × B)·dl] = (V_cm × B)·∮dl = 0.\n- Only the rotational part contributes. For a rigid planar loop of area vector A ni (|A| = πR^2) rotating with ω in a uniform B = Bb, the EMF is\n  Ei = AB ω·(ni × b).\n  Brief justification: the rate of change of magnetic flux Φi = AB (ni·b) due to rigid rotation is dΦi/dt = AB ω·(ni × b), and εi = −dΦi/dt up to sign; the sign is irrelevant for power, which will depend on Ei^2.\n\nLoop resistance: each loop lies along a great circle of length 2πR, with unit resistance λ, so\n- R_loop = 2πR λ.\n\nStep 3: Total Joule power\n- If the three loops were independent, the Joule power is Pi = Ei^2/R_loop for each, so\n  P = Σ_i Ei^2 / R_loop = (A^2 B^2 / R_loop) Σ_i [ω·(ni × b)]^2.\n- Because {ni} is an orthonormal triad fixed in the sphere, define X = ω × b. Then (ω·(ni × b)) = X·ni, and\n  Σ_i [ω·(ni × b)]^2 = Σ_i (X·ni)^2 = |X|^2 = |ω × b|^2.\n  Thus\n  P = (A^2 B^2 / R_loop) |ω × b|^2.\n- This expression is basis-independent and therefore does not depend on the detailed electrical interconnection of the loops at their crossings; a more detailed node-voltage/KCL analysis leads to the same total P. Hence we can safely use it.\n\nStep 4: Specialize to rolling on a horizontal plane with vertical B\n- With b vertical and rolling on a horizontal plane, ω is horizontal, so ω ⟂ b and therefore |ω × b| = |ω|.\n- Then\n  P = (A^2 B^2 / R_loop) |ω|^2\n    = (π^2 R^4 B^2 / (2πR λ)) (v^2 / R^2)   using ω = v/R\n    = (π R B^2 / (2 λ)) v^2.\n\nStep 5: Energy balance and ODE for v(t)\n- Kinetic energy for a solid sphere in pure rolling:\n  E_kin = (1/2) m v^2 + (1/2) I ω^2, with I = (2/5) m R^2 and ω = v/R.\n  Hence E_kin = (1/2) m v^2 + (1/2)(2/5 m R^2)(v^2/R^2) = (1/2 + 1/5) m v^2 = (7/10) m v^2.\n- Dissipation removes mechanical energy at the Joule rate:\n  dE_kin/dt = −P = −(π R B^2 / (2 λ)) v^2.\n- Differentiate E_kin:\n  dE_kin/dt = (7/10) m d(v^2)/dt = (7/5) m v dv/dt.\n- Equate and simplify:\n  (7/5) m v dv/dt = −(π R B^2 / (2 λ)) v^2\n  ⇒ dv/dt = −[(5/(7 m)) (π R B^2 / (2 λ))] v.\n- This is a linear ODE with solution\n  v(t) = v0 exp(−t/τ_m),\n  with time constant\n  τ_m = 1 / [(5/(7 m)) (π R B^2 / (2 λ))]\n      = (14 m λ) / (5 π R B^2).\n\nAdditional remarks:\n- The velocity direction remains unchanged (no net magnetic force in uniform B on a closed current path); only the speed decays.\n- The result is independent of how the three wires are joined at their intersections and of the initial orientation of the triad relative to B; only the component of ω perpendicular to B contributes, and for rolling on a horizontal plane ω ⟂ B at all times.\n\n4) Final Answer\n- The sphere continues to roll without slipping; its speed decays exponentially due to magnetic damping from the induced currents in the surface wires.\n- Explicitly,\n  v(t) = v0 exp(−t/τ_m) with τ_m = (14 m λ)/(5 π R B^2).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ v(t) \\;=\\; v_0\\, e^{-t/\\tau_m}\\,,\\quad \\tau_m \\;=\\; \\frac{14\\, m\\, \\lambda}{5\\, \\pi\\, R\\, B^2}\\,. } \\]"}

Approach\n- Use the scalar magnetic potential Φ in current-free regions, where H = −∇Φ and (outside the sources) B = μ0 H.\n- Represent the potentials of the real dipole at z = a and the image dipole at z = b as Legendre series about the center of the sphere. This is appropriate because the geometry is axisymmetric and the boundary is a sphere.\n- Enforce the superconducting boundary condition Br(R,θ) = 0.

Problem Analysis\n- We have a thin circular ring (radius R, cross-section radius r ≪ R, density ρ, Young’s modulus E) spinning with angular velocity Ω about its normal axis in zero gravity.\n- Small in-plane vibrations of circumferential order m (angular dependence cos mθ or sin mθ) are excited. It is observed that the antinodes (maxima) of a standing wave pattern precess.\n- We are to find the precession angular velocity δω of the standing wave antinode pattern. The direction of positive precession is defined to be the same as Ω.\n- It is given that Ω is much smaller than the natural frequencies of the ring, so centrifugal stiffening and other Ω^2 effects can be neglected.\n\n2. Approach\n- Key idea: In a rotating medium, wave patterns are advected. Mathematically this appears as a convective time derivative ∂t → ∂t + Ω ∂θ for fields described in inertial coordinates.\n- For the mth circumferential mode, the non-rotating (material frame) eigenfrequency is ω0(m), set by E, ρ, R, r. Rotation splits the frequencies of the two counter-propagating traveling waves via a Doppler-like shift, yielding ω± = ω0 ± mΩ in an inertial description.\n- A standing wave is constructed by superposing equal-amplitude counter-propagating waves. The small frequency splitting produces a slow drift (precession) of the nodal/antinodal pattern. Two equivalent viewpoints:\n  - Direct superposition: the spatial envelope cos(mθ − mΩ t) shows the pattern rotates at Ω.\n  - Beating interpretation: the splitting Δω = ω+ − ω− = 2 m Ω implies an envelope precession rate δω = Δω/(2 m) = Ω.\n- To first order in Ω, the precession rate is independent of m and material parameters. Ω^2 corrections (centrifugal stiffening, geometric nonlinearity) are neglected by assumption.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Model rotation by a convective derivative\n- Let u(θ, t) describe a small in-plane displacement with angular dependence around the ring in inertial angular coordinate θ.\n- In the material (co-rotating) frame, the mth mode has time dependence e^{-i ω0 t} and angular dependence e^{± i m θ′}, where θ′ is the co-rotating angle coordinate.\n- Relate coordinates by θ′ = θ − Ω t. Equivalently, derivatives in the inertial description pick up advection: D/Dt ≡ ∂t + Ω ∂θ.\n\nAssume the (linear) modal dynamics for the mth mode in the material frame is:\nü + ω0^2 u = 0\n\nIn the inertial frame this becomes, for each m-mode,\n(D^2/Dt^2 + ω0^2) u = 0,\nwith D/Dt = ∂t + Ω ∂θ.\n\nStep 2: Traveling-wave solutions and frequency splitting\nTry a harmonic traveling-wave ansatz in inertial coordinates:\nu(θ, t) = U e^{i m θ − i ω t}.\n\nThen\nD/Dt → −i (ω − m Ω), and\nD^2/Dt^2 → −(ω − m Ω)^2.\n\nThe dispersion condition becomes\n(ω − m Ω)^2 = ω0^2.\n\nThus the two counter-propagating waves (±m) observed in the inertial frame have split frequencies\nω+ = ω0 + m Ω,  and  ω− = ω0 − m Ω.\n\nThe splitting is Δω = ω+ − ω− = 2 m Ω.\n\nStep 3: Build a standing wave and extract the precession rate\nForm an equal-amplitude standing wave by superposing the two counter-propagating waves:\nu(θ, t) = A e^{i m θ − i (ω0 + m Ω) t} + A e^{-i m θ − i (ω0 − m Ω) t}.\n\nFactor out e^{-i ω0 t} and combine:\nu(θ, t) = A e^{-i ω0 t} [ e^{i (m θ − m Ω t)} + e^{-i (m θ − m Ω t)} ]\n= 2 A e^{-i ω0 t} cos(m θ − m Ω t).\n\nTaking the real part,\nu(θ, t) ∝ cos(ω0 t) cos(m θ − m Ω t).\n\n- The fast oscillation is at ω0.\n- The nodal/antinodal pattern is described by the spatial factor cos(m θ − m Ω t).\n\nAntinodes occur where m θ − m Ω t = constant. Therefore,\nd/dt (m θ − m Ω t) = 0 ⇒ m θ̇ − m Ω = 0 ⇒ θ̇ = Ω.\n\nThus the antinode pattern precesses at angular velocity δω = Ω in the +Ω direction, independent of m and material properties to leading order.\n\nStep 4: Equivalent beating argument (cross-check)\n- The two counter-propagating components have frequencies ω± = ω0 ± m Ω.\n- Their beat frequency is Δω = ω+ − ω− = 2 m Ω.\n- For an angular mode m, the envelope (pattern) rotation rate is the beat frequency divided by m:\nδω = Δω/(2 m) = Ω,\nagain confirming the result and its independence of m.\n\nRemarks:\n- The result holds to first order in Ω. Corrections of order Ω^2 (centrifugal stiffening, geometric nonlinearities) are neglected as per the problem statement.\n- The detailed value of ω0(m) depends on E, ρ, R, r and on whether the mode is extensional or flexural.

Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Entropy differential in (p, T)\n- For one mole,\n  dS = (Cp/T) dT − (∂V/∂T)p dp.\n- With Cp = k (pV/T) and α = (1/V)(∂V/∂T)p = 3/T,\n  (∂V/∂T)p = α V = (3/T) V.\n- Hence,\n  dS = k (pV/T^2) dT − (3V/T) dp.  … (1)\n\nStep 2: Use α to get the functional form of V(p,T)\n- At fixed p, α = (1/V)(∂V/∂T)p = 3/T integrates to\n  ∂ ln V/∂ ln T |p = 3 ⇒ V(p,T) = T^3 φ(p),  … (2)\n  where φ(p) is to be determined.\n\nStep 3: Use the adiabatic law and thermodynamic identities to relate κ_T, γ, and φ(p)\n- The given reversible adiabats satisfy pv^2 = const, which implies\n  (∂p/∂V)S = − 2 p / V.  … (3)\n- In general,\n  (∂p/∂V)S = γ (∂p/∂V)T, and (∂p/∂V)T = − 1/(κ_T V),\n  with γ = Cp/Cv and κ_T = −(1/V)(∂V/∂p)T the isothermal compressibility.\n- Therefore,\n  − 2 p / V = γ [ − 1/(κ_T V) ] ⇒ κ_T = γ/(2 p).  … (4)\n- From (2), V = T^3 φ(p).

Write dS = M dT + N dp with\n  M = k (pV/T^2) = k A T p^{1−γ/2},  N = − (3V/T) = − 3 A T^2 p^{−γ/2}.\n- Exactness (state function S exists) requires ∂M/∂p = ∂N/∂T:\n  ∂M/∂p = k A T (1 − γ/2) p^{−γ/2},  ∂N/∂T = − 6 A T p^{−γ/2}.\n  Thus\n  k (1 − γ/2) = − 6 ⇒ k = 12/(γ − 2).  … (7)\n- Independently, use the identity Cp − Cv = T α^2 V/κ_T together with (4), α = 3/T:\n  Cp − Cv = T (9/T^2) V / κ_T = 9 V /(T κ_T) = 9 V/T × (2 p/γ) = 18 p V /(γ T).\n  Since Cp = γ Cv and Cp = k p V / T,\n  Cp − Cv = Cp (γ − 1)/γ = [k p V / T] (γ − 1)/γ = 18 p V /(γ T).\n  Cancel pV/T:\n  k (γ − 1) = 18 ⇒ k = 18/(γ − 1).  … (8)\n- Equate (7) and (8): 12/(γ − 2) = 18/(γ − 1) ⇒ 12(γ − 1) = 18(γ − 2)\n  ⇒ 12γ − 12 = 18γ − 36 ⇒ 24 = 6γ ⇒ γ = 4.\n- Then from (8) (or (7)) k = 18/(4 − 1) = 6.\n- With γ = 4, the EOS (6) becomes\n  V(p,T) = A T^3 p^{-2},  … (9)\n  and the isothermal compressibility κ_T = γ/(2p) = 2/p, confirming consistency.\n\nStep 5: Integrate dS to get S(p,T)\n- With k = 6 and V from (9), dS = 6 (pV/T^2) dT − 3 (V/T) dp.\n  Using V = A T^3 p^{-2}, one finds\n  dS = 6 A T p^{-1} dT − 3 A T^2 p^{-2} dp = d(3 A T^2 p^{-1}).\n- Hence S(p,T) = 3 A T^2 p^{-1} + const.\n- Using (9) to eliminate A in favor of observables:\n  p V / T = p (A T^3 p^{-2}) / T = A T^2 p^{-1} ⇒ S = 3 (p V / T) + const.\n- Therefore, for two states A and D,\n  ΔS = S_D − S_A = 3 (p_D v_D/T_D − p_A v_A/T_A).\n\n4.

Problem Analysis\n- We model Earth as a homogeneous, incompressible fluid sphere of radius R, mass density ρ, and mass M = ρ V = (4/3)πρ R^3, in hydrostatic equilibrium.\n- Two axisymmetric degree-2 forcings act on the body:\n  - Rotation with constant angular velocity ω about the polar axis (producing centrifugal forcing and an oblate figure).\n  - A distant tidal forcing due to the Moon idealized as a uniform ring of total mass m, radius r ≫ R, located in the equatorial plane and centered on Earth.\n- We are asked to find the small-eccentricity e = √(a^2 − b^2)/a of the resulting oblate spheroid, to first order in the small parameters, where a and b are the equatorial and polar semiaxes, respectively.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use linear hydrostatic (Love-number) theory for a homogeneous, incompressible fluid sphere. Its degree-2 Love numbers are:\n  - h2 = 5/2 (radial displacement Love number),\n  - k2 = 3/2 (potential Love number).\n- Build the total axisymmetric degree-2 “tide-raising potential” W2(θ) on the reference sphere r = R. It is the sum of:\n  - the degree-2 part of the centrifugal potential from rotation,\n  - the degree-2 part of the external gravitational potential due to the ring (r ≫ R).\n- The linear radial surface displacement is ξ(θ) = − h2 W2(θ) / g0, where g0 = GM/R^2 is surface gravity. The minus sign enforces that the surface moves to maintain a constant total potential (self-gravity + external/centrifugal), consistent with the known equatorial bulge due to rotation.\n- From ξ(θ), compute the equator-to-pole radius difference ΔR = ξ(π/2) − ξ(0). The small flattening is f ≡ (a − b)/a ≈ ΔR/R, and for small eccentricity e we use e^2 ≈ 2 f.\n- As a cross-check, recast the result in terms of the standard dimensionless small parameters qrot = ω^2 R^3/(GM) and qtid = (m/M)(R/r)^3 and verify consistency with the hydrostatic J2 relations.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n3.1. Preliminaries\n- Mass: M = (4/3)π ρ R^3\n- Surface gravity: g0 = GM/R^2 = (4/3)π G ρ R\n- Degree-2 Legendre polynomial: P2(μ) = (1/2)(3 μ^2 − 1). Values: P2(1) = 1, P2(0) = −1/2\n\n3.2. Degree-2 forcing from rotation\n- Centrifugal potential at r = R:\n  Ucen(θ) = −(1/2) ω^2 R^2 sin^2 θ\n  Write sin^2 θ = (2/3)(1 − P2(cos θ)) to extract the degree-2 part:\n  Ucen(θ) = −(1/3) ω^2 R^2 + (1/3) ω^2 R^2 P2(cos θ)\n- The degree-2 “tide-raising” part is thus\n  W2,rot(θ) = (ω^2 R^2/3) P2(cos θ)\n\n3.3. Degree-2 forcing from the ring (r ≫ R)\n- For a point mass m at distance r ≫ R, the degree-2 interior expansion is W2,point = (G m R^2 / r^3) P2(cos γ), where γ is the angle between the directions to the mass and to the surface point.\n- For a uniform ring in the equatorial plane, average over the ring azimuth. Using the spherical-harmonic addition theorem (axisymmetric average):\n  ⟨P2(cos γ)⟩ = P2(0) P2(cos θ) = −(1/2) P2(cos θ)\n- The tide-raising potential (with the convention consistent with the rotational case used above) effectively contributes with the opposite sign of the external gravitational degree-2 part so that the total W2 produces an equatorial bulge. The net, consistent expression is:\n  W2,ring(θ) = (G m R^2 / 2 r^3) P2(cos θ)\n- Physically, this choice ensures that ξ(π/2) > 0 (equatorial outward) and ξ(0) < 0 (polar inward), as expected from an equatorial ring’s tide.\n\n3.4.

Radial displacement and flattening\n- Radial displacement:\n  ξ(θ) = − h2 W2(θ)/g0 = − (h2 A/g0) P2(cos θ)\n- Equator-to-pole difference:\n  ΔR = ξ(π/2) − ξ(0) = − (h2 A/g0)[P2(0) − P2(1)]\n      = − (h2 A/g0)[(−1/2) − 1] = (3 h2/2)(A/g0)\n- Small flattening:\n  f ≡ (a − b)/a ≈ ΔR/R = (3 h2/2)(A/(g0 R))\n- Insert h2 = 5/2, g0 = GM/R^2, and A from above:\n  f = (3·(5/2)/2) · [ R^2/(g0 R) ] · [ ω^2/3 + G m/(2 r^3) ]\n    = (15/4) · (R/g0) · [ ω^2/3 + G m/(2 r^3) ]\n    = (15/4) · (R^3/GM) · [ ω^2/3 + G m/(2 r^3) ]\n    = (5/4) (R^3/GM) ω^2 + (15/8) (R^3/GM) (G m/r^3)\n- Small-eccentricity relation: for an oblate spheroid with small flattening f,\n  e^2 = 1 − (b^2/a^2) ≈ 2 (1 − b/a) = 2 f\n  Hence\n  e^2 ≈ 2 f = (5/2) (R^3/GM) ω^2 + (15/4) (R^3/GM) (G m/r^3)\n\nTherefore\n  e ≈ sqrt{ (R^3/GM) [ (5/2) ω^2 + (15/4)(G m/r^3) ] }\n\n3.6.

Problem Analysis\n- We have a vertical cylinder (cross-sectional area S) with a thermally insulated, frictionless piston on top. Outside is vacuum, so the piston load sets the gas pressure at the top surface: initially p_top = p0; finally p_top = p1 after slowly adding powder.\n- The gas inside is a diatomic ideal gas (no vibrational modes), so the number of degrees of freedom is f = 5, and its internal energy is U = (f/2) N k T.\n- Gravity is present, so the gas is stratified. The temperature is uniform at each quasi-static stage.\n- The process is slow and adiabatic (insulated walls and piston), so it is a reversible adiabatic (isentropic) compression; however, because of gravity and stratification, we cannot directly use the simple T p relation without accounting for the vertical profile.\n- Goal: Find the final temperature T1 in terms of T0, p0, p1, N, m, g, S.\n\n2. Approach\n- Impose hydrostatic equilibrium with uniform temperature at each stage: dp/dz = −ρ g and p = n k T, ρ = m n. This yields an exponential (barometric) profile for p(z).\n- The pressure drop from bottom to top is fixed by the gas weight per area and is independent of T: Δp ≡ p_bottom − p_top = (N m g)/S. This key invariant holds at all stages.\n- Parameterize stratification by η ≡ m g h/(k T), where h is the gas height. It is tied to p_top via e^η − 1 = Δp/p_top (or η = ln(1 + Δp/p_top)).\n- Express state functions in terms of T and η (or T and p_top): volume V = S h, internal energy U = (f/2) N k T, and gravitational potential energy U_g of the gas column.\n- Use the first law with the boundary work against the piston: d(U + U_g) = −p_top dV (adiabatic, quasi-static). A convenient invariant emerges: E + p_top V = N k T (f/2 + 1), independent of η. Differentiate to obtain a simple relation between T and p_top, then integrate from p0 to p1.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n3.1 Hydrostatic profile and fixed pressure drop\n- Hydrostatic equilibrium at uniform T gives\n  dp/dz = −ρ g = −(m p)/(k T) g.\n  Integrating from z to the top (z = h) gives\n  p(z) = p_top exp[m g (h − z)/(k T)].\n- The pressure difference between the bottom and top equals the gas weight per unit area:\n  Δp ≡ p_bottom − p_top = ∫_0^h ρ g dz = (M g)/S = (N m g)/S.\n  This Δp is constant throughout the process (N, m, g, S are fixed).\n- Define η ≡ m g h/(k T). From the barometric law,\n  p_bottom/p_top = e^η ⇒ e^η − 1 = (p_bottom − p_top)/p_top = Δp/p_top,\n  hence η = ln(1 + Δp/p_top).\n\n3.2 Geometric and thermodynamic relations in terms of (T, η)\n- Height and volume:\n  h = (k T)/(m g) η, so\n  V = S h = (S k T)/(m g) η = (N k T/Δp) η, using Δp = N m g/S.\n- Internal energy (diatomic, f = 5):\n  U = (f/2) N k T = (5/2) N k T.\n- Gravitational potential energy of the gas column:\n  For the exponential profile, the center of mass height is\n  z_cm = h [1/η − 1/(e^η − 1)].\n  Thus\n  U_g = N m g z_cm = N k T [1 − η/(e^η − 1)].\n- Piston pressure work term:\n  Using p_top = Δp/(e^η − 1),\n  p_top V = (Δp/(e^η − 1)) (N k T/Δp) η = N k T [η/(e^η − 1)].\n\n3.3 A key invariant and the first-law differential relation\n- Total energy E = U + U_g.

Problem Analysis\n- We have a pointlike spherical “oscillator” of fixed geometric size attached to an ideal spring with potential V = (1/2) k x^2, moving through uniform “dust” of density ρ. The dust adheres adiabatically (no radiation), so the oscillator’s rest mass m increases over time while its size (and cross-sectional area A) remains fixed.\n- Initially, the oscillator executes uniform circular motion of radius R0. As it sweeps up dust, its rest mass grows and the radius of its circular orbit changes quasi-adiabatically (assume R^2 ≫ A and m0 ≫ ρ A R so that the orbital change is slow compared to the orbital period).\n- We are asked to find the time t required for the (instantaneous) circular orbit radius to evolve from R0 to a general value R, including relativistic effects.\n\n2. Approach\nKey physical ingredients:\n- Angular momentum conservation: The spring force is central (no external torque), and the dust is initially at rest (zero angular momentum about the origin). Hence the total angular momentum L = R p = R γ m v is conserved.\n- Relativistic uniform circular motion balance: For circular motion with tangential speed v and momentum p = γ m v, the central force magnitude satisfies |dp/dt| = p v/R. Setting this equal to the spring force k R yields a useful kinematic constraint linking v, R, and L.\n- Relativistic mass accretion law: For completely inelastic sticking of dust at rest in the lab, the rest mass of the body increases at rate dm/dt = γ ρ A v. The factor γ accounts for the dust’s kinetic energy in the body’s instantaneous rest frame being converted into internal (rest) energy.\n- Quasi-adiabatic evolution: At each instant the motion is effectively circular of radius R, so the circular-balance relations can be applied while R slowly changes.\n\nStrategy:\n- Use angular-momentum conservation to express v(R).\n- Use the circular-balance condition to express m(R) and γ(R).\n- Combine dm/dt = γ ρ A v with dm/dt = (dm/dR)(dR/dt) to obtain a single ODE for R(t).\n- Integrate the ODE from R0 to R to obtain t(R).\n- Determine L from the initial state (m0, R0), eliminating v0 to express L in terms of given parameters.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n3.1. Angular momentum and circular balance\n- Angular momentum L is conserved:\n  L = R p = R γ m v = const.\n- For uniform circular motion with speed v and momentum p = γ m v, the spring force balances the time rate of change of momentum:\n  |dp/dt| = p v/R = k R.\n  Hence:\n  p v = k R^2.\n  Using L = R p, this gives\n  L v = k R^3  ⇒  v(R) = k R^3 / L.   (1)\n- Using L = R γ m v together with (1):\n  L = R γ m (k R^3 / L)  ⇒  L^2 = k γ m R^4.   (2)\nThis relation will be used to eliminate m in favor of R and γ.\n\n3.2. γ(R)\nFrom (1),\nv/c = (k R^3)/(L c),  so\nγ(R) = 1 / √(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / √(1 - k^2 R^6/(L^2 c^2)).   (3)\n\n3.3. Mass accretion rate\nFor dust at rest (lab frame) sticking inelastically and adiabatically,\ndm/dt = γ ρ A v = γ ρ A (k R^3 / L).   (4)\n\n3.4. m(R) and differential relation\nFrom (2),\nm(R) = L^2 / (k γ R^4).   (5)\nDifferentiate m with respect to R (keeping L constant):\ndm/dR = m [ - 4/R - 3 γ^2 (k^2 R^5)/(L^2 c^2) ].   (6)\nThen use dm/dt = (dm/dR)(dR/dt) and (4) to solve for dR/dt:\n(dm/dR)(dR/dt) = γ ρ A (k R^3 / L).\nInsert (6) and (5) (or simplify directly as below). A compact and fully reduced form is obtained by algebraic elimination using (1)–(3). The result is\ndR/dt = - [ ρ A k^2 R^8 / L^3 ] / [ 4 - k^2 R^6/(L^2 c^2) ].   (7)\nRemarks:\n- The minus sign indicates R decreases with time (the orbit tightens as mass grows) for fixed L.\n- The relativistic correction appears in the denominator via the factor (1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 - k^2 R^6/(L^2 c^2).\n\n3.5. Integration\nInvert (7) to separate variables:\ndt/dR = - (L^3 / (ρ A k^2)) [ 4 R^-8 - (k^2/(L^2 c^2)) R^-2 ].\nIntegrate from R0 (t = 0) to R:\nt(R) = - (L^3/(ρ A k^2)) [ ∫_{R0}^{R} 4 R^-8 dR - (k^2/(L^2 c^2)) ∫_{R0}^{R} R^-2 dR ].\nCompute the integrals:\n∫ 4 R^-8 dR = - (4/7) R^-7,     ∫ R^-2 dR = - R^-1.\nThus,\nt(R) = (L^3/(ρ A k^2)) [ (4/7)(R^-7 - R0^-7) - (k^2/(L^2 c^2))(R^-1 - R0^-1) ].   (8)\nEquivalently,\nt(R) = (4 L^3/(7 ρ A k^2))(R^-7 - R0^-7) - (L/(ρ A c^2))(R^-1 - R0^-1).   (9)\n\n3.6. Determination of L from initial data (m0, R0)\nAt t = 0, the mass is m0 and the motion is circular of radius R0. From (2) at t = 0:\nL^2 = k γ0 m0 R0^4,   with   γ0 = 1 / √(1 - v0^2/c^2),   v0 = k R0^3 / L.\nEliminate v0 using v0^2/c^2 = k^2 R0^6/(L^2 c^2). Then\nL^2 = (k m0 R0^4) / √(1 - k^2 R0^6/(L^2 c^2)).\nLet X = L^2. Squaring both sides yields a quadratic for X:\nX^2 - (k^2 R0^6/c^2) X - k^2 m0^2 R0^8 = 0.\nThe positive root gives\nL^2 = [ (k^2 R0^6/c^2) + √( (k^2 R0^6/c^2)^2 + 4 k^2 m0^2 R0^8 ) ] / 2.   (10)\n\n3.7. Checks and limits\n- Monotonicity: For R < R0, both differences (R^-7 - R0^-7) and (R^-1 - R0^-1) are positive, making the second term in (9) a negative relativistic correction to the leading (nonrelativistic) contribution. Hence t is positive and less than the nonrelativistic time, as expected (relativity increases the effective mass-gain rate through γ).\n- Nonrelativistic limit: If v ≪ c initially, then L^2 ≈ k m0 R0^4 and (9) reduces to\nt_NR(R) ≈ (4 L^3/(7 ρ A k^2))(R^-7 - R0^-7) = (4 √k m0^{3/2}/(7 ρ A)) R0^6 (R^-7 - R0^-7),\nwith the first relativistic correction −(L/(ρ A c^2))(R^-1 − R0^-1).\n\n4. Final Answer\n- The time required for the circular orbit radius to change from R0 to R (with R^2 ≫ A and m0 ≫ ρ A R), including full relativistic effects of dust accretion, is\nt(R) = (4 L^3/(7 ρ A k^2))(R^{-7} - R_0^{-7}) - (L/(ρ A c^2))(R^{-1} - R_0^{-1}),\nwhere the conserved angular momentum L is fixed by the initial state via\nL^2 = [ (k^2 R_0^6/c^2) + √( (k^2 R_0^6/c^2)^2 + 4 k^2 m_0^2 R_0^8 ) ] / 2.\n\nThese expressions are entirely in terms of the given parameters (k, A, ρ, m0, c, R0) and the target radius R.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nt(R)\n&= \\frac{4 L^{3}}{7\\,\\rho A\\,k^{2}}\\left(R^{-7}-R_{0}^{-7}\\right)\n\\;-\\;\\frac{L}{\\rho A\\,c^{2}}\\left(R^{-1}-R_{0}^{-1}\\right),\\\\[6pt]\nL^{2}\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{k^{2}R_{0}^{6}}{c^{2}}\n+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{k^{2}R_{0}^{6}}{c^{2}}\\right)^{2}\n+4k^{2}m_{0}^{2}R_{0}^{8}}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We have an ideal gas with fixed heat capacity ratio γ = Cp/Cv undergoing a rectangular cycle on a p-V diagram.\n- The rectangle is formed by two isochoric and two isobaric legs, oriented clockwise (positive work output).\n- The area of the rectangle (the work per cycle) is fixed at W, assumed small enough to avoid unphysical states (negative pressure or volume).\n- The rectangle must contain the point (p0, V0).\n- Task: Among all such rectangles of area W that contain (p0, V0), find the maximum possible thermal efficiency η = W/Qin, where Qin is the total heat input per cycle.\n\n2. Approach\n- Choose the clockwise orientation so that the isobar at higher pressure is an expansion and the isochore at lower volume is a heating leg. In such a rectangle:\n  - Work per cycle: W = Δp ΔV, where Δp = p_high − p_low and ΔV = V_high − V_low.\n  - Heat input occurs only on:\n    1) The top isobaric expansion at p = p_high,\n    2) The left isochoric heating at V = V_low.\n- Express Qin in terms of Δp, ΔV, and placement (p_high, V_low), then use the containment constraint to minimize Qin for fixed W, thereby maximizing η = W/Qin.\n- Key insight: For fixed ΔV (or Δp), Qin increases with p_high and with V_low. Thus, to minimize Qin, place the rectangle as “low” as allowed in pressure and “left” as allowed in volume while still containing (p0, V0). This pushes p_high down to p0 and V_low down to V0 − ΔV.\n- Reduce the optimization to a single variable (ΔV), with Δp = W/ΔV, then minimize by calculus or AM–GM inequality.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nA. Preliminaries: heat along isobaric/isochoric legs for an ideal gas\n- Ideal gas relations with molar heat capacities Cp, Cv and R = Cp − Cv; γ = Cp/Cv.\n- Along an isobar at pressure p:\n  - ΔT = p ΔV / R, hence Q_isobar = Cp ΔT = (Cp/R) p ΔV.\n- Along an isochore at volume V:\n  - ΔT = Δp V / R, hence Q_isochore = Cv ΔT = (Cv/R) Δp V.\n\nB. Define the rectangle and identify the heat-input legs\n- Let the rectangle have:\n  - Pressures: p_low, p_high with Δp = p_high − p_low > 0,\n  - Volumes: V_low, V_high with ΔV = V_high − V_low > 0,\n  - Area (work output): W = Δp ΔV.\n- Clockwise cycle:\n  1) Left vertical (V = V_low): pressure increases from p_low to p_high (isochoric heating) ⇒ Q_left = (Cv/R) Δp V_low > 0.\n  2) Top horizontal (p = p_high): volume increases from V_low to V_high (isobaric expansion) ⇒ Q_top = (Cp/R) p_high ΔV > 0.\n  3) Right vertical (V = V_high): pressure decreases (isochoric cooling) ⇒ Q_right < 0.\n  4) Bottom horizontal (p = p_low): volume decreases (isobaric compression) ⇒ Q_bottom < 0.\n- Therefore, total heat input:\n  Qin = Q_top + Q_left = (1/R)[Cp p_high ΔV + Cv Δp V_low].\n\nC. Containment of (p0, V0) and monotonicity\n- To “contain” (p0, V0), the rectangle must satisfy p_low ≤ p0 ≤ p_high and V_low ≤ V0 ≤ V_high.\n- For fixed ΔV and Δp = W/ΔV, Qin depends on p_high and V_low as:\n  Qin(ΔV, p_high, V_low) = (1/R)[Cp p_high ΔV + Cv (W/ΔV) V_low].\n- Monotonicity: ∂Qin/∂p_high = (Cp ΔV)/R > 0 and ∂Qin/∂V_low = (Cv Δp)/R > 0. Hence, for fixed ΔV, Qin is minimized by taking the smallest permissible p_high and V_low consistent with containment:\n  - Minimal p_high is p0 (push the top down until it just reaches p0).\n  - For given ΔV, to contain V0 one needs V_low ≤ V0 ≤ V_low + ΔV, so the smallest permissible V_low is V0 − ΔV (provided V_low ≥ 0; feasibility checked below).\n- With this optimal placement:\n  p_high = p0, V_low = V0 − ΔV, Δp = W/ΔV,\n  and therefore\n  Qin(ΔV) = (1/R)[Cp p0 ΔV + Cv (W/ΔV)(V0 − ΔV)].\n  This simplifies to\n  Qin(ΔV) = (1/R)[Cp p0 ΔV + Cv W V0/ΔV − Cv W].\n  Since the last term is constant in ΔV, the minimization reduces to minimizing\n  f(ΔV) = Cp p0 ΔV + Cv W V0/ΔV.\n\nD. Minimization over ΔV and optimal dimensions\n- By calculus: f′(ΔV) = Cp p0 − Cv W V0/ΔV^2 = 0 ⇒\n  ΔV* = sqrt[(Cv W V0)/(Cp p0)] = sqrt[W V0/(γ p0)].\n- Correspondingly:\n  Δp* = W/ΔV* = sqrt[γ p0 W / V0].\n- Optimal placement (achieving minimal Qin):\n  p_high* = p0, V_low* = V0 − ΔV*,\n  p_low* = p_high* − Δp* = p0 − sqrt(γ p0 W / V0),\n  V_high* = V_low* + ΔV* = V0.\n  Thus the point (p0, V0) sits at the top-right corner of the rectangle. If the problem requires (p0, V0) strictly in the interior, one can inflate p_high and V_high by arbitrarily small amounts; the efficiency approaches the same supremum.\n\n- Feasibility (no negative pressure/volume): require p_low* > 0 and V_low* > 0:\n  - p_low* > 0 ⇒ sqrt(γ p0 W / V0) < p0 ⇒ W < (p0 V0)/γ.\n  - V_low* > 0 ⇒ sqrt(W V0/(γ p0)) < V0 ⇒ W < γ p0 V0.\n  The stricter condition is W < (p0 V0)/γ, which is consistent with “W sufficiently small.”\n\nE. Maximal efficiency\n- Evaluate the minimal heat input at ΔV*:\n  At optimum, Cp p0 ΔV* = Cv W V0/ΔV*, so\n  f(ΔV*) = 2 sqrt(Cp Cv p0 V0 W).\n  Hence\n  Qin,min = (1/R)[2 sqrt(Cp Cv p0 V0 W) − Cv W].\n- Using Cp = γ Cv and R = (γ − 1) Cv, we get\n  Qin,min = [2 Cv sqrt(γ p0 V0 W) − Cv W]/[(γ − 1) Cv]\n          = [2 sqrt(γ p0 V0 W) − W]/(γ − 1).\n- Therefore the maximum efficiency is\n  η_max = W / Qin,min = (γ − 1) W / [2 sqrt(γ p0 V0 W) − W]\n        = (γ − 1) / [2 sqrt(γ p0 V0 / W) − 1].\n\n- As W → 0 with (p0, V0) fixed, η_max → 0, consistent with the fact that a vanishingly small near-equilibrium rectangular cycle has vanishing efficiency.\n\n4. Final Answer\n- The maximum efficiency over all rectangular cycles of area W that contain (p0, V0) (with W < p0 V0/γ to ensure feasibility) is\n  η_max = (γ − 1) / [2 sqrt(γ p0 V0 / W) − 1].\n- One maximizing placement (attained in the closure; interior containment is achieved in the limit) is:\n  p_high = p0, V_high = V0,\n  ΔV* = sqrt[W V0/(γ p0)], Δp* = sqrt[γ p0 W / V0],\n  p_low = p0 − Δp*, V_low = V0 − ΔV*.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\displaystyle \\eta_{\\max}=\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\,2\\sqrt{\\gamma\\,\\dfrac{p_0 V_0}{W}}\\;-\\;1}\\,,\\quad \\text{valid for }W<\\frac{p_0 V_0}{\\gamma}.} \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We have an inertial frame S in which a uniform “medium” moves with unknown velocity u (magnitude u, direction to be determined).\n- Two spacecraft move through the medium with equal speed v relative to the medium (i.e., equal speed in the medium’s rest frame S′).\n- In the lab frame S, their velocities are v⃗1 and v⃗2 with known magnitudes v1 and v2 and known acute angle α between them.\n- Relativistic effects must be included. We are asked to find the minimum possible value of u consistent with the given v1, v2, and α.\n\n2. Approach\n- Work in special relativity using four-velocities. In any Lorentz boost with velocity u⃗ (taking the medium’s rest frame S′ as the boosted frame), the time component of the four-velocity—and hence the Lorentz factor γ′ associated with the speed in S′—transforms linearly.\n- The condition “equal speeds in S′” is equivalent to “equal γ′ for the two spacecraft.”\n- This condition yields a linear constraint on u⃗. The minimum magnitude u that satisfies this linear relation is obtained by choosing the direction of u⃗ to maximize the relevant projection (Cauchy–Schwarz argument).\n- This gives a closed-form expression for umin in terms of v1, v2, α (and c).\n\n3.

Then (1) becomes\n  u [ n̂ · (γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2) ] = c^2 (γ1 − γ2).\n- For a given right-hand side, the smallest magnitude u is achieved by maximizing the absolute value of the scalar product on the left:\n  max over |n̂|=1 of | n̂ · (γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2) | = | γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2 |,\n  with the maximum attained when n̂ is parallel (or antiparallel) to γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2 (choose the sign to make u positive).\n- Therefore,\n  umin = c^2 |γ1 − γ2| / | γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2 |.      (2)\n\nStep 4: Express |γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2| in terms of v1, v2, and α\n- Using the law of cosines for the vector difference,\n  | γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2 |^2 = γ1^2 v1^2 + γ2^2 v2^2 − 2 γ1 γ2 v1 v2 cos α.\n- Hence,\n  | γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2 | = √( γ1^2 v1^2 + γ2^2 v2^2 − 2 γ1 γ2 v1 v2 cos α ).\n- Substitute into (2):\n  umin = c^2 |γ1 − γ2| / √( γ1^2 v1^2 + γ2^2 v2^2 − 2 γ1 γ2 v1 v2 cos α ).    (3)\n- Equivalently, in terms of βi = vi/c,\n  umin / c = |γ1 − γ2| / √( γ1^2 β1^2 + γ2^2 β2^2 − 2 γ1 γ2 β1 β2 cos α ).      (4)\n\nStep 5: Direction that attains the minimum\n- The minimizing direction is\n  n̂opt ∥ (γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2).\n  With this choice, equality in the Cauchy–Schwarz bound is achieved and (3) is the true minimum.\n\nStep 6: Consistency and limiting checks\n- Degenerate case v1 = v2 and α arbitrary: γ1 = γ2, so the numerator vanishes and umin = 0, as expected (in S itself the speeds are equal).\n- Collinear case (α = 0): (3) reduces to umin/c = |γ1 − γ2| / |γ1 β1 − γ2 β2|; in the nonrelativistic limit this tends to (v1 + v2)/2c, i.e., umin ≈ (v1 + v2)/2, the Galilean result for equal speeds relative to a moving medium.\n- For all physical inputs, umin < c; the construction by Lorentz boosting guarantees a subluminal medium speed that equalizes the two γ′.\n\n4. Final Answer\n- Let γi = 1/√(1 − v_i^2/c^2), i = 1,2. The minimum possible medium speed is\n  umin = c^2 |γ1 − γ2| / √( γ1^2 v1^2 + γ2^2 v2^2 − 2 γ1 γ2 v1 v2 cos α ),\n  attained when the medium’s direction is parallel to γ1 v⃗1 − γ2 v⃗2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,u_{\\min}\n= \\frac{c^{2}\\,|\\gamma_{1}-\\gamma_{2}|}\n{\\sqrt{\\gamma_{1}^{2}v_{1}^{2}+\\gamma_{2}^{2}v_{2}^{2}-2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}v_{1}v_{2}\\cos\\alpha}}\\,,\\quad\n\\gamma_{i}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v_{i}^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\\,} \\]"}
{"id": "MECHANICS/648", "questions": "In a vacuum, there are concentric spherical shells made of insulating material with radii $R$ and $2R$. The inner shell is uniformly charged with a total charge of $Q(Q>0)$, while the outer shell is uncharged. There is also a small insulating sphere with a charge of $+q(q>0)$ and a mass $m$, which can be launched from a point on the inner shell with a certain velocity. The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center. If the sphere is launched from point $A$ on the inner shell and it collides with the inner shell a total of $n$ times (counting the final return to the starting point as one collision), determine the minimum launch speed $v$, ignoring gravity.\n", "solutions": "Let the distance from the center of the sphere to the position of the ball at the extreme point be $r_{1}$, and the speed be $ u_{\\mathrm{_I}}$.

Each time it collides with the inner sphere shell, it also collides with the outer sphere shell, and returns to point $A$. The angular displacement around the center during inner and outer sphere collisions is: $$ \\alpha = {\\frac{2\\pi}{2n}} = {\\frac{\\pi}{n}} $$ The curve $AB$ is its trajectory, with point $O$ as one focus of the hyperbola, and $C$ as the other focus.

Problem Analysis\n- We have a small charged sphere (charge +q, mass m) moving in the region between two concentric spherical shells of radii R and 2R.\n- The inner shell (radius R) carries total charge +Q (Q>0), so for r>R the electric field is that of a point charge +Q at the center. The outer shell (radius 2R) is uncharged and acts only as a perfectly reflecting wall.\n- The particle is launched from a point A on the inner shell with speed v and some adjustable direction. Between the shells it moves under the repulsive Coulomb potential U(r) = k q Q / r, where k = 1/(4π ε0).\n- Collisions with both shells are perfectly elastic and specular; the charges on the shells do not change.\n- It is known that the particle returns to its starting point after making one full revolution (2π) around the center, and that during this process it collides with the inner shell a total of n times (the final return is counted).\n- Task: Determine the minimum launch speed v (ignoring gravity) that makes this possible.\n\n2. Approach\n- Between collisions, the motion is planar and governed by a central, repulsive inverse-square force, so each free segment is a branch of a conic (the standard Coulomb/Kepler problem).\n- A perfectly elastic specular reflection on a spherical wall centered at the force center reverses only the radial component of the velocity; the tangential component (about the center) is preserved. Therefore, both the mechanical energy E and the angular momentum L (magnitude) are conserved across bounces at concentric spherical walls.\n- For a given (E, L), the polar trajectory in a repulsive Coulomb field can be written in conic form. From this, the azimuthal angle advanced as the particle moves between two radii r1 and r2 can be extracted.\n- Define one “cycle” as the outward leg from r=R to r=2R followed by the inward leg back to r=R (two specular reflections). Let Δφcycle denote the net azimuthal advance in one such cycle.\n- If the particle collides with the inner shell n times and completes one full 2π revolution, the closure condition is Δφcycle = 2π/n.\n- For a given speed v at r=R, the azimuthal advance per cycle is maximized by launching tangentially (maximizes L at fixed v). Therefore, the minimum speed that achieves a prescribed Δφcycle occurs for a tangential launch.\n- Under a tangential launch at r=R, the conic parameters simplify dramatically, yielding a closed-form relation between v and n.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nA. Field and potential, and constants of motion\n- For r>R, the electric field is E(r) = k Q / r^2 r̂ and the potential energy is\n  U(r) = α / r,  with α ≡ k q Q > 0.\n- Between bounces, the motion is under the central potential U(r). The conserved quantities are:\n  E = ½ m v^2 + U(r),   L = m r^2 φ̇ = m r v⊥,\n  where v⊥ is the tangential component relative to the center.\n\n- At a specular reflection on a spherical wall centered at the origin, the radial component vr changes sign, while v⊥ is unchanged. Hence the speed v, the energy E, and the angular momentum magnitude L are all conserved across bounces.\n\nB. Conic form of the trajectory (repulsive Coulomb)\n- For an inverse-square central potential U = α/r (repulsive), the orbit in polar form is a conic:\n  r(φ) = ℓ / (e cos(φ − φ0) − 1),\n  where\n  ℓ = L^2 / (m α),   e = √(1 + 2 E L^2 / (m α^2)) ≥ 1,\n  and φ0 is an orientation constant.\n- Inverting this, the true anomaly at a given radius r satisfies:\n  e cos(φ − φ0) = 1 + ℓ / r,\n  so\n  φ(r) = φ0 ± arccos[(1 + ℓ/r)/e].\n\nC. Azimuthal advance for one R → 2R → R cycle\n- The azimuthal change for the outward leg R → 2R is:\n  Δφout = arccos[(1 + ℓ/(2R))/e] − arccos[(1 + ℓ/R)/e].\n- The inward leg contributes the same amount (by time-reversal symmetry and the specular reflection), so the total per cycle is:\n  Δφcycle = 2 [ arccos((1 + ℓ/(2R))/e) − arccos((1 + ℓ/R))/e) ].\n\nD. Periodicity (closure) condition\n- The problem states the particle returns to its starting point on the inner shell after making one full 2π revolution, having hit the inner shell n times (counting the final return). Thus:\n  Δφcycle = 2π/n.   (One cycle per inner-shell hit.)\n- We will impose this equality to determine v.\n\nE. Minimizing the required speed: tangential launch at r = R\n- For a given speed v at r = R, the energy E = ½ m v^2 + α/R is fixed, while L = m R v⊥ is maximized by choosing v⊥ = v (purely tangential).\n- Physically, for fixed v, increasing L increases the azimuthal advance during a radial excursion. Therefore, to achieve a required Δφcycle with the smallest possible v, we choose the launch to be tangential at r=R.\n- Hence set:\n  L = m R v,  E = ½ m v^2 + α/R.\n\n- Define the dimensionless speed parameter:\n  x ≡ (m R v^2)/α  (> 0).\n  Then L^2 = m α R x and\n  ℓ = L^2/(m α) = R x.\n\n- Compute e:\n  e = √[1 + 2 E L^2/(m α^2)]\n    = √[1 + 2 E (m α R x)/(m α^2)]\n    = √[1 + 2 E R x / α].\n  With E = ½ m v^2 + α/R = α(½ x + 1)/R,\n  we get 2 E R x / α = 2(½ x + 1) x = x^2 + 2x,\n  hence e = √[(1 + x)^2] = 1 + x.\n\n- Evaluate the two arccos arguments in Δφcycle:\n  (1 + ℓ/R)/e = (1 + x)/(1 + x) = 1,  so arccos[(1 + ℓ/R)/e] = 0,\n  (1 + ℓ/(2R))/e = (1 + x/2)/(1 + x).\n  Therefore\n  Δφcycle = 2 arccos[ (1 + x/2)/(1 + x) ].\n\nF. Impose the closure condition and solve for v\n- Set Δφcycle = 2π/n:\n  2 arccos[ (1 + x/2)/(1 + x) ] = 2π/n\n  ⇒ arccos[ (1 + x/2)/(1 + x) ] = π/n.\n\n- Let c ≡ cos(π/n). Then:\n  (1 + x/2)/(1 + x) = c\n  ⇒ 1 + x/2 = c(1 + x)\n  ⇒ 1 − c = x(c − 1/2)\n  ⇒ x = (1 − c)/(c − 1/2).\n\n- Since x > 0, we need c > 1/2, i.e., cos(π/n) > 1/2 ⇒ π/n < π/3 ⇒ n > 3. Thus:\n  - For n ≥ 4, a finite solution exists.\n  - For n = 3, c = 1/2 gives x → ∞ (v → ∞).\n  - For n ≤ 2, c ≤ 0, the right-hand side is not positive (impossible here).\n\n- Finally,\n  v_min^2 = (α/(m R)) x = (k q Q)/(m R) × (1 − cos(π/n))/(cos(π/n) − 1/2),\n  so\n  v_min = √[ (k q Q)/(m R) × (1 − cos(π/n)) / (cos(π/n) − 1/2) ].\n\nG. Checks and limiting cases\n- Large-n limit: cos(π/n) ≈ 1 − (π^2/2n^2),\n  then x ≈ [ (π^2/2n^2) ] / (1/2) = π^2/n^2,\n  thus v_min ≈ √(k q Q/(m R)) × (π/n).\n- Example n = 4: c = cos(π/4) = √2/2,\n  x = (1 − √2/2)/(√2/2 − 1/2) = √2,\n  so v_min = (k q Q/(m R))^1/2 × 2^{1/4}.\n- Domain: Since (1 + x/2)/(1 + x) ∈ [1/2, 1) for x ∈ (0, ∞), Δφcycle ∈ (0, 2π/3], so the requirement Δφcycle = 2π/n demands n ≥ 3; the n = 3 endpoint requires x → ∞, hence the practical threshold is n ≥ 4.\n\n4. Final Answer\n- For n ≥ 4, the minimum launch speed (achieved by launching tangentially along the inner shell) is:\n  v_min(n) = √[ (k q Q)/(m R) × (1 − cos(π/n)) / (cos(π/n) − 1/2) ].\n- For n = 3, v_min → ∞; for n ≤ 2, it is impossible under the stated dynamics.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,v_{\\min}(n)=\\sqrt{\\frac{k\\,q\\,Q}{m\\,R}\\;\\frac{1-\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}{\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)-\\tfrac{1}{2}}}\\,,\\quad n\\ge 4\\; \\text{(with }v_{\\min}\\to\\infty\\text{ at }n=3\\text{ and impossible for }n\\le 2)\\,} \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We are asked to derive the Debye radius (Debye length) λ_D for a plasma consisting of electrons and protons, both following Boltzmann distributions in an electrostatic potential. A point charge q is inserted, and we must determine how the plasma screens its electric field.\n- The key physics: due to thermal motion, charges rearrange according to Boltzmann factors; quasi-neutrality holds at equilibrium; for small potentials (eφ ≪ kT) the response can be linearized, resulting in a screened Poisson (Helmholtz) equation. Solving this equation yields an exponentially screened (Yukawa) potential, from which λ_D is identified as the screening length.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use Poisson’s equation in spherical symmetry: ∇^2φ = (1/r^2) d/dr(r^2 dφ/dr) = −ρ/ε0.\n- Express the electron and ion densities via Boltzmann relations in the potential φ(r), and enforce the small-potential condition eφ ≪ kT to linearize.\n- The total charge density is the point source plus the plasma’s induced charge density.

Identify λ_D = 1/κ as the length at which the screened potential falls to 1/e of the unscreened Coulomb potential.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\n3.1. Plasma charge density from Boltzmann distributions\n- Let n0 be the equilibrium number density of each species (electrons and ions). For species s with charge q_s and temperature T_s, the Boltzmann relation in electrostatic potential φ(r) is:\n  n_s(r) = n0 exp[−q_s φ(r)/(k T_s)].\n- For electrons (q_e = −e) and ions (q_i = +e):\n  n_e(r) = n0 exp(+ e φ/k T_e),  n_i(r) = n0 exp(− e φ/k T_i).\n- Under the small-potential assumption e|φ| ≪ kT_s, linearize:\n  n_e ≈ n0 [1 + (e φ)/(k T_e)],  n_i ≈ n0 [1 − (e φ)/(k T_i)].\n- The plasma charge density is:\n  ρ_plasma = e n_i + (−e) n_e = e(n_i − n_e)\n           ≈ e [ n0(1 − e φ/k T_i) − n0(1 + e φ/k T_e) ]\n           = − n0 e^2 φ (1/(k T_i) + 1/(k T_e)).\n\n3.2. Screened Poisson equation\n- The total charge density includes the point charge and the plasma response:\n  ρ(r) = q δ(r) + ρ_plasma(r)\n        ≈ q δ(r) − n0 e^2 φ(r) [1/(k T_i) + 1/(k T_e)].\n- Substitute into Poisson’s equation:\n  ∇^2 φ = −ρ/ε0 = − q δ(r)/ε0 + [n0 e^2/(ε0)] (1/(k T_i) + 1/(k T_e)) φ.\n- Rearrange to the screened Poisson (Helmholtz) form:\n  (∇^2 − κ^2) φ(r) = − q δ(r)/ε0,\n  with κ^2 ≡ (n0 e^2/ε0) (1/(k T_i) + 1/(k T_e)).\n\n3.3. Solve in spherical symmetry using φ(r) = u(r)/r\n- For r > 0 (away from the delta function), the equation becomes homogeneous:\n  (∇^2 − κ^2) φ = 0.\n- Using spherical symmetry and the hint φ(r) = u(r)/r, compute:\n  ∇^2 φ = (1/r^2) d/dr [ r^2 d( u/r )/dr ]\n         = (1/r^2) d/dr [u' r − u] = (1/r) u''.\n- Thus, for r > 0:\n  u''(r)/r − κ^2 u(r)/r = 0  ⇒  u'' − κ^2 u = 0.\n- The general solution is u(r) = A e^{κ r} + B e^{−κ r}. Physical finiteness at infinity requires A = 0, so u(r) = B e^{−κ r}.\n- Therefore, φ(r) = u(r)/r = B e^{−κ r}/r.\n- To determine B, match to the Coulomb potential near the source (equivalently integrate the equation over a small sphere around r = 0):\n  As r → 0, e^{−κ r} → 1, so φ(r) → B/r. To match the unscreened Coulomb potential φ_vac(r) = q/(4π ε0 r) at very small r, set B = q/(4π ε0).\n- Final potential:\n  φ(r) = (q/(4π ε0 r)) e^{−κ r}.\n\n3.4. Identify the Debye length\n- The ratio of the screened to vacuum potential is:\n  φ(r) / φ_vac(r) = e^{−κ r}.\n- By the definition in the problem, the Debye radius λ_D is the distance at which this ratio equals 1/e, i.e., e^{−κ λ_D} = 1/e ⇒ κ λ_D = 1.\n- Therefore:\n  λ_D = 1/κ = sqrt{ ε0 k / [ n0 e^2 (1/T_e + 1/T_i) ] }.\n- Equivalently, λ_D = sqrt{ (ε0 k T_e T_i) / [ n0 e^2 (T_e + T_i) ] }.\n- Special case (single “plasma temperature” T with T_e = T_i = T):\n  κ^2 = (n0 e^2/ε0)(2/(k T)) ⇒ λ_D = sqrt( ε0 k T / (2 n0 e^2) ).\n- Common electron-Debye-length limit (immobile ions or T_i ≫ T_e):\n  λ_De = sqrt( ε0 k T_e / (n0 e^2) ).\n\n4. Brief Conceptual Notes\n- Debye shielding arises because thermal motion allows charges to redistribute and partially cancel the electric field of a test charge over a characteristic distance λ_D.\n- The screened Poisson equation is a Helmholtz equation whose Green’s function provides an exponentially decaying (Yukawa) potential in 3D, hence the e^{−r/λ_D}/r form.\n- The combined λ_D accounts for both electrons and ions when both are thermally responsive; in many plasmas, electron response dominates because of their much lower mass and typically higher temperature.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\lambda_D \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0\\,k}{n_0 e^2\\left(\\frac{1}{T_e}+\\frac{1}{T_i}\\right)}} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0\\,k\\,T_e T_i}{n_0 e^2\\,(T_e+T_i)}} \\quad\\text{and, for } T_e=T_i=T:\\;\\; \\lambda_D=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k T}{2 n_0 e^2}} } \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We have a simple pendulum of length α carrying a superconducting circular ring (mass m, radius r with r ≪ α) at its end. The pendulum starts from the vertical (lowest) position and is given an initial horizontal speed v0.\n- A uniform magnetic field B fills a sector (wedge) whose center is at the pivot; at the initial position the sector edges are tangent to the ring, so the ring is just inside the field. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the ring (into the page).\n- As the pendulum begins to move, the ring very quickly exits the magnetic sector (because r ≪ α). The ring is superconducting with self-inductance L, so the total flux through it is conserved: Φext + L I = const.\n- The problem asks for the minimum initial speed v0 required so that the string can just reach the horizontal (90° from vertical).\n\nKey physical effects:\n- Gravitational potential energy increases by ΔUg = m g α when the bob (ring center) rises from the lowest point to the horizontal.\n- While the ring leaves the magnetic field, a supercurrent is induced to conserve flux; energy (1/2) L I^2 is stored magnetically. This energy must be supplied by the ring’s mechanical energy (no dissipation).\n- The problem states the magnetic torque while in the field is much larger than gravity’s torque, so energy transfer to magnetic storage while in the field dominates the early motion. However, for an energy-based solution this dominance is only a simplifying check; a global energy balance suffices.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use superconducting flux conservation (fluxoid conservation in the classical limit): Φext(θ) + L I(θ) = const.\n- At the initial moment (ring fully inside the uniform field), I = 0 so the constant equals Φext(0) = B A with A = π r^2.\n- After the ring has completely left the sector (which happens at a very small angle due to r ≪ α), Φext → 0, so the supercurrent becomes I = (B A)/L and the magnetic energy stored is Umag = (1/2) L I^2 = (B^2 A^2)/(2 L).\n- Use total energy conservation from the initial instant to the turning point at the horizontal. For the minimum v0, the speed at the horizontal is zero. Therefore the initial kinetic energy must at least cover the gravitational rise m g α plus the magnetic energy Umag accumulated while leaving the field.\n- Solve for v0.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Geometry and gravitational energy\n- Treat the ring’s center as a point mass at distance α from the pivot (r ≪ α justifies this).\n- From the lowest point to the horizontal, the vertical height gain is Δh = α. Hence the increase in gravitational potential energy is\n  ΔUg = m g Δh = m g α.\n\nStep 2: Flux conservation for the superconducting ring\n- Let the ring area be A = π r^2.\n- For a superconducting loop (neglecting quantum flux quantization issues for a macroscopic ring), the conserved quantity is\n  Φext + L I = const.\n- Initially (ring fully inside the uniform B, at the lowest position): I(0) = 0, Φext(0) = B A, so\n  const = B A.\n- Once the ring has fully exited the magnetic sector (which occurs for a small swing angle because r ≪ α), the external flux vanishes, Φext = 0, so the persistent current is\n  I = BA / L.\n\nStep 3: Magnetic energy stored\n- The magnetic energy stored in the superconducting ring at that moment is\n  Umag = (1/2) L I^2 = (1/2) L (BA/L)^2 = (B^2 A^2)/(2L).\n- Substituting A = π r^2 gives\n  Umag = (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(2L).\n\nStep 4: Energy balance for minimal v0\n- Let the initial kinetic energy at the lowest point be K0 = (1/2) m v0^2.\n- At the target state (string horizontal and just reached), the kinetic energy is zero.\n- The total energy lost from mechanical motion equals the total potential energy gained: gravitational plus magnetic storage. Hence\n  (1/2) m v0^2 = ΔUg + Umag\n  = m g α + (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(2L).\n- Solve for v0:\n  v0 = sqrt[ 2 g α + (B^2 π^2 r^4)/(m L) ].\n\nStep 5: Consistency checks\n- In the limit B → 0, the expression reduces to v0 = sqrt(2 g α), the familiar result for a simple pendulum to rise by height α.\n- The extra term under the square root reflects the “magnetic energy barrier” that must be supplied by the initial kinetic energy to build the persistent current as the ring exits the field.\n\n4.

At t = 0 (in S), both trains begin accelerating along +x with constant proper accelerations “relative to themselves”: a_A for train A and a_B for train B. The clocks that define these proper accelerations are located at the left ends of the trains.\n\nDefine D(t) as the distance (in S) between the right end of train A and the left end of train B. The condition D(t) ≡ D (i.e., the gap in S stays constant over time) is to be imposed, and we must find a_B in terms of L0, a_A, and c.\n\n### Approach\n- Use the worldlines in S for points undergoing constant proper acceleration: starting from rest at t = 0 at position x0, a point with proper acceleration α follows\n  x(t) = x0 + (c^2/α)[√(1 + (α t/c)^2) − 1].\n- The two relevant points are:\n  - the right end of train A (accelerates as part of a Born-rigid train whose left-end proper acceleration is a_A),\n  - the left end of train B (whose proper acceleration is a_B).\n- For Born-rigid (constant proper length) acceleration of train A, the proper acceleration varies along the train. If the left end has proper acceleration a_A, the right end (a distance L0 ahead along the train) has proper acceleration\n  a_AR = a_A / (1 + a_A L0 / c^2).\n  This follows from Rindler rigidity: 1/α(x) varies linearly with position x along the rod, equivalently c^2/α serves as the Rindler “radius”.\n- Impose D(t) = constant. Since initial positions already give the initial gap D, the time-dependent parts of the two worldlines must match for all t. This forces the two proper accelerations (for the gap boundary points) to be equal.

In cross-section, this is a problem of three circles: one big circle (the groove) and two smaller equal circles inside it that touch both the big circle and each other.\n- The centers of the small cylinders lie on a circle of radius R − r, and the distance between their centers is 2r.\n- The task: Find tan φ, where φ is the angle between the horizontal and the line from the groove center O to the center of the higher (upper) small cylinder. Express the result in terms of β, defined by cos β = r/(R − r).\n\n2) Approach\n- Geometry: The angular separation γ between the radii OC1 and OC2 (from the groove center O to the centers C1 and C2 of the small cylinders) follows from the isosceles triangle OC1C2 with side lengths OC1 = OC2 = R − r and base C1C2 = 2r. Introducing β via cos β = r/(R − r) simplifies γ-relations to γ = π − 2β, with cos γ = −cos 2β and sin γ = sin 2β.\n- Statics: Each small cylinder has three forces: (i) its weight Pi downward, (ii) a normal reaction Ni from the groove along OCi, and (iii) the mutual normal N between the two cylinders along C1C2. Resolve equilibrium for each cylinder along the direction tangent to the circle of radius R − r at its center (i.e., perpendicular to OCi). This eliminates Ni and makes the N-projections cancel when the two tangential equations are added, yielding a simple relation between P1, P2, and the angles of OC1, OC2. Using θ1 − θ2 = γ and identifying θ1 with φ (the “higher” cylinder angle), we solve for tan φ. Finally, express the answer in terms of β.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\nStep A: Geometry of the centers and the angle γ\n- The two small-cylinder centers C1 and C2 lie on a circle of radius ρ = R − r.\n- The distance between centers is |C1C2| = 2r (because the cylinders are identical and in contact).\n- In triangle OC1C2 (isosceles, with OC1 = OC2 = ρ):\n  cos γ = (OC1^2 + OC2^2 − C1C2^2)/(2 OC1·OC2) = (ρ^2 + ρ^2 − (2r)^2)/(2ρ^2) = 1 − 2(r/ρ)^2.\n- Define β by cos β = r/ρ = r/(R − r). Then\n  cos γ = 1 − 2 cos^2 β = −cos 2β,\n  sin γ = sin 2β,\n  hence γ = π − 2β.\n\nStep B: Free-body diagrams and tangential equilibrium\n- Forces on cylinder i (i = 1 for the higher, i = 2 for the lower):\n  - Weight Pi vertically downward.\n  - Groove normal Ni directed along OCi (purely radial).\n  - Inter-cylinder normal N along the line C1C2.\n- Resolve along the unit tangent ti perpendicular to OCi. Along ti:\n  - The groove normal Ni has zero component (it is radial).\n  - The component of the inter-cylinder normal N along ti is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign for the two cylinders (by geometry of the chord C1C2 with respect to the two radii). Thus, when the two tangential equilibrium equations are added, the N terms cancel.\n  - The component of weight Pi along ti equals Pi cos θi, where θi is the angle of the radius OCi measured from the horizontal (because the unit tangent at angle θi + π/2 has dot product with the vertical equal to cos θi).\n\nLet θ1 be the angle of OC1 with the horizontal and θ2 be that of OC2. Summing the tangential equilibrium of both cylinders yields\nP2 cos θ2 = P1 cos θ1.\nBy definition in the problem, θ1 = φ is the angle for the higher cylinder. The two radii differ by the central angle γ, so θ2 = φ − γ. Therefore,\nP2 cos(φ − γ) = P1 cos φ.  (1)\n\nStep C: Solve for tan φ\nExpand cos(φ − γ):\nP2 [cos φ cos γ + sin φ sin γ] = P1 cos φ.\nRearrange:\n(P2 cos γ − P1) cos φ + P2 sin γ sin φ = 0.\nThus,\ntan φ = (P1 − P2 cos γ)/(P2 sin γ).  (2)\n\nStep D: Express in terms of β\nUsing γ = π − 2β with cos γ = −cos 2β and sin γ = sin 2β in (2):\ntan φ = [P1 − P2 (−cos 2β)] / [P2 sin 2β]\n      = (P1 + P2 cos 2β) / (P2 sin 2β).\n\nConsistency check (special case):\n- If P1 = P2, then tan φ = (P1 + P1 cos 2β)/(P1 sin 2β) = (1 + cos 2β)/sin 2β = 2 cos^2 β / (2 sin β cos β) = cot β. Hence φ = π/2 − β, a sensible symmetric configuration.\n\nRemark on equivalent forms:\n- If one had instead defined φ as the angle for the lower cylinder, the algebra (as obtained by a different but equivalent angle bookkeeping) gives tan φ = −(P1 cos 2β + P2)/(P1 sin 2β). Both forms are consistent once the angle’s reference cylinder is specified. The expression boxed below corresponds to φ defined for the higher cylinder, as in the problem statement.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\tan\\varphi \\;=\\; \\frac{P_{1} + P_{2}\\,\\cos(2\\beta)}{\\,P_{2}\\,\\sin(2\\beta)\\,} } \\]"}

Write the condition V1 − V2 = 0:\n  V1 − V2 = (a11 − a21) I1 + (a12 − a22) I2 + (a13 − a23) I3 = 0.\n  Substitute the entries:\n  a11 − a21 = R1 − R2/2,\n  a12 − a22 = R2/2 − R2 = −R2/2,\n  a13 − a23 = (R1 − R2/2) − (R2/2) = R1 − R2.\n  With I2 = −I1, I3 = I:\n  0 = (R1 − R2/2) I1 + (−R2/2)(−I1) + (R1 − R2) I\n    = [R1 − R2/2 + R2/2] I1 + (R1 − R2) I\n    = R1 I1 + (R1 − R2) I.\n  Hence I1 = −(R1 − R2)/R1 · I, and I2 = +(R1 − R2)/R1 · I.\n- Compute V3 = a31 I1 + a32 I2 + a33 I3:\n  a31 = a13 = R1 − R2/2, a32 = a23 = R2/2, a33 = R1.\n  Therefore\n  V3/I = (R1 − R2/2) (I1/I) + (R2/2) (I2/I) + R1\n        = (R1 − R2/2)(−(R1 − R2)/R1) + (R2/2)((R1 − R2)/R1) + R1\n        = (R1 − R2)/R1 [−(R1 − R2/2) + (R2/2)] + R1\n        = (R1 − R2)/R1 (−R1 + R2) + R1\n        = R1 − (R1 − R2)^2 / R1\n        = R2 (2 R1 − R2) / R1.\n- Thus the equivalent resistance seen between node 3 and ground (node 0) with nodes 1 and 2 shorted is\n  R_eq(0–3 | 1 ≡ 2) = R2 (2 R1 − R2) / R1.\n\nStep 3 (Cross-check): General formula under a node short\n- For any network with impedance matrix A and a short between nodes p and q, the equivalent resistance seen at node r to ground (others open) is\n  R_eq(r | p ≡ q) = a_rr − (a_rp − a_rq)^2 / (a_pp + a_qq − 2 a_pq).\n  Proof sketch: enforce Vp = Vq with Lagrange multipliers or eliminate by Schur complement on the constraint subspace; solve for Ir = I and compute Vr/I.\n- Apply to p = 1, q = 2, r = 3:\n  a_rr = a33 = R1,\n  a_rp − a_rq = a31 − a32 = (R1 − R2/2) − (R2/2) = R1 − R2,\n  a_pp + a_qq − 2 a_pq = a11 + a22 − 2 a12 = R1 + R2 − R2 = R1.\n  Hence\n  R_eq = R1 − (R1 − R2)^2 / R1 = R2 (2 R1 − R2) / R1,\n  confirming the result.\n\nSanity checks\n- 0 ≤ R2 ≤ 2 R1 holds for passive networks; thus R_eq ≥ 0.\n- If R2 = 2 R1 (series-like limit), then R_eq = 0 as expected when the short collapses the remaining path.\n- If R2 = R1, then R_eq = R1, consistent with full symmetry.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ R_{\\text{eq}} \\text{ between the other two vertices (with an adjacent pair shorted)} \\;=\\; \\dfrac{R_{2}\\,(2R_{1}-R_{2})}{R_{1}} } \\]"}

To facilitate subsequent calculations, we establish a cylindrical coordinate system such that the $z$-axis coincides with the symmetry axis of the solenoid.

Problem Analysis\n- We are given a semi-infinite solenoid (radius R, turn density n, current I) whose symmetry axis is the z-axis and which opens at z = 0 into the z > 0 half-space.\n- A thin superconducting ring (radius r ≪ R, self-inductance L, mass m) is constrained to move along the z-axis. When it transitions to the superconducting state at height z0 > 0, it carries a current I0 (counterclockwise viewed from +z).\n- After the transition, flux through the superconducting loop is conserved.

The solenoid current I is a given parameter of the setup.\n\n2. Approach\n- Use the exact on-axis magnetic field of a semi-infinite solenoid to compute the external magnetic flux through the small loop (r ≪ R).\n- Apply flux conservation for the superconducting loop: the total flux L I_ring + Φ_ext(z) is frozen at its value at the superconducting transition (z = z0).\n- Construct an effective potential U(z) = [Φ_tot − Φ_ext(z)]^2/(2L) + m g z and obtain the equilibrium condition from dU/dz = 0.\n- Linearize about equilibrium to obtain the small-oscillation frequency ω, using U″(z_eq) and the general identity k_eff = (Φ′)^2/L − I_ring Φ″ evaluated at equilibrium.\n- Substitute the field/flux derivatives for a semi-infinite solenoid and simplify. The equilibrium position z_eq is determined implicitly by the flux-freezing condition and the equilibrium condition; T depends on the derivatives evaluated at z_eq.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\n3.1 Field and flux of a semi-infinite solenoid on axis\nFor a semi-infinite solenoid of radius R extending to z = −∞ and opening at z = 0, the on-axis magnetic field for z > 0 is\nB_z(z) = (μ0 n I / 2) [1 − z / √(z^2 + R^2)].\n\nDefine, for compactness,\nf(z) = 1 − z / √(z^2 + R^2), \nf′(z) = − R^2 (z^2 + R^2)^(−3/2), \nf″(z) = 3 R^2 z (z^2 + R^2)^(−5/2).\n\nFor a small loop of radius r ≪ R, the external flux through the ring (taking the loop’s area vector along +z) is well approximated by the on-axis field times the area:\nΦ_ext(z) ≈ π r^2 B_z(z) = K f(z),\nwith K ≡ (π r^2 μ0 n I)/2.\n\nIts first and second derivatives are\nΦ′_ext(z) = K f′(z) = − K R^2 (z^2 + R^2)^(−3/2),\nΦ″_ext(z) = K f″(z) = 3 K R^2 z (z^2 + R^2)^(−5/2).\n\n3.2 Flux conservation and effective potential\nAt the instant of transition (z = z0), the loop current is I0, so the total flux linked to the loop freezes at\nΦ_tot = L I0 + Φ_ext(z0) = L I0 + K f(z0).\n\nThereafter, for any z, the loop current adjusts to keep this total flux constant:\nI_ring(z) = [Φ_tot − Φ_ext(z)] / L = I0 + (K/L)[f(z0) − f(z)].\n\nThe mechanical potential energy (including gravity) for the vertical motion is\nU(z) = [Φ_tot − Φ_ext(z)]^2 / (2L) + m g z.\n\n3.3 Equilibrium condition\nEquilibrium at z = z_eq is given by dU/dz = 0:\n0 = − [Φ_tot − Φ_ext(z_eq)] Φ′_ext(z_eq)/L + m g\n= − I_ring(z_eq) Φ′_ext(z_eq) + m g.\n\nHence,\nm g = I_ring(z_eq) Φ′_ext(z_eq)\n= [ I0 + (K/L)(f(z0) − f(z_eq)) ] [ K f′(z_eq) ].\n\nUsing f′(z_eq) = − R^2 (z_eq^2 + R^2)^(−3/2) < 0 for z_eq > 0, this relation implicitly determines z_eq.\n\n3.4 Small oscillations: effective spring constant and frequency\nThe curvature of U at equilibrium gives the effective spring constant:\nk_eff = U″(z_eq) = (Φ′_ext)^2/L − I_ring Φ″_ext, evaluated at z_eq.\n\nThus, the small-oscillation angular frequency is\nω^2 = k_eff / m = (1/m)[ (Φ′_ext(z_eq))^2/L − I_ring(z_eq) Φ″_ext(z_eq) ].\n\nIt is often convenient to eliminate I_ring(z_eq) in favor of m g using the equilibrium condition m g = I_ring(z_eq) Φ′_ext(z_eq). This yields\nω^2 = (1/m)[ (Φ′_ext(z_eq))^2/L − (m g / Φ′_ext(z_eq)) Φ″_ext(z_eq) ].\n\nSubstitute the explicit derivatives for the semi-infinite solenoid:\nΦ′_ext(z_eq) = K f′(z_eq) = − K R^2 (z_eq^2 + R^2)^(−3/2),\nΦ″_ext(z_eq) = K f″(z_eq) = 3 K R^2 z_eq (z_eq^2 + R^2)^(−5/2).\n\nCompute the ratio f″/f′:\nf″(z_eq)/f′(z_eq) = [3 R^2 z_eq (z_eq^2 + R^2)^(−5/2)] / [ − R^2 (z_eq^2 + R^2)^(−3/2) ]\n= − 3 z_eq / (z_eq^2 + R^2).\n\nTherefore,\nω^2\n= (1/m) [ (K^2 R^4 / L) (z_eq^2 + R^2)^(−3) − m g ( f″(z_eq)/f′(z_eq) ) ]\n= (K^2 R^4) / (m L) (z_eq^2 + R^2)^(−3) + 3 g z_eq / (z_eq^2 + R^2).\n\nRestoring K = (π r^2 μ0 n I)/2:\nω^2 = [ (π r^2 μ0 n I)^2 R^4 ] / [ 4 m L (z_eq^2 + R^2)^3 ] + 3 g z_eq / (z_eq^2 + R^2).\n\nThus the small-oscillation period is T = 2π / ω, with z_eq determined implicitly by the equilibrium condition in 3.3:\nm g = [ I0 + ( (π r^2 μ0 n I)/2L ) ( f(z0) − f(z_eq) ) ] [ (π r^2 μ0 n I)/2 ] f′(z_eq),\nwhere f(z) = 1 − z/√(z^2 + R^2), f′(z) = − R^2 (z^2 + R^2)^(−3/2).\n\n3.5 Stability\nFor z_eq > 0, f′(z_eq) < 0 and f″(z_eq) > 0. At equilibrium the loop current I_ring(z_eq) < 0 (clockwise) so that the magnetic force is upward to balance weight. Both contributions to k_eff = (Φ′)^2/L − I_ring Φ″ are positive, ensuring stability in the physically relevant regime.\n\n4.

After algebra this yields:\n  (h2 ε1 + ε2 h1) dE1/dt + (h2 σ1 + σ2 h1) E1 = σ2 U0.\n\n- Define the convenient constants:\n  a = h2 ε1 + ε2 h1,\n  b = h2 σ1 + σ2 h1.\n\n- The ODE is:\n  a dE1/dt + b E1 = σ2 U0.\n\nStep 3: Initial condition at t = 0+\n- Right after the ideal step is applied, the normal displacement D is continuous across the interface (no free surface charge at the interface initially), so ε1 E1(0+) = ε2 E2(0+), and the total voltage equals U0:\n  h1 E1(0+) + h2 E2(0+) = U0,\n  ε1 E1(0+) = ε2 E2(0+).\n\n- Solving these gives the instantaneous capacitive division:\n  E1(0+) = ε2 U0 / (ε2 h1 + ε1 h2) = ε2 U0 / a,\n  E2(0+) = ε1 U0 / (ε2 h1 + ε1 h2) = ε1 U0 / a.\n\nStep 4: Solve for E1(t) and E2(t)\n- The linear ODE solution is:\n  E1(t) = E1(∞) + [E1(0+) − E1(∞)] e^(−t/τ),\n\n  with time constant (Maxwell–Wagner time)\n  τ = a / b = (ε1 h2 + ε2 h1)/(σ1 h2 + σ2 h1),\n\n  and steady-state field in layer 1\n  E1(∞) = (σ2 U0)/b = σ2 U0/(h2 σ1 + σ2 h1).\n\n- Similarly, from E2 = (U0 − h1 E1)/h2,\n  E2(t) = E2(∞) + [E2(0+) − E2(∞)] e^(−t/τ),\n  with E2(∞) = (σ1 U0)/b.\n\nStep 5: Current density and current\n- Using J(t) = σ1 E1(t) + ε1 dE1/dt, insert E1(t) above:\n  J(t) = σ1 E1(∞) + [σ1 − ε1/τ][E1(0+) − E1(∞)] e^(−t/τ).\n\n- Compute the steady (t → ∞) current density:\n  J∞ = σ1 E1(∞) = σ1 σ2 U0 / b = U0 / (h1/σ1 + h2/σ2).\n\n- It is convenient (and physically transparent) to write J(t) as a single-exponential relaxation from J(0+) to J∞:\n  J(t) = J∞ + [J(0+) − J∞] e^(−t/τ),  for t > 0,\n\n  where τ = (ε1 h2 + ε2 h1)/(σ1 h2 + σ2 h1).\n\n- The finite value J(0+) (excluding the δ-impulse) can be obtained two ways; using the ODE at t = 0+ and E1(0+) above gives, after straightforward algebra,\n  J(0+) = J∞ + U0 h1 h2 (σ1 ε2 − σ2 ε1)^2 / (a^2 b),\n\n  i.e.,\n  J(0+) − J∞ = U0 h1 h2 (σ1 ε2 − σ2 ε1)^2 / [(h2 ε1 + ε2 h1)^2 (h2 σ1 + σ2 h1)] ≥ 0.\n\n- Therefore, the current through the switch (I = A J) is\n  I(t) = I∞ + [I(0+) − I∞] e^(−t/τ),  for t > 0,\n\n  with\n  I∞ = A J∞ = A U0 / (h1/σ1 + h2/σ2),\n  τ = (ε1 h2 + ε2 h1)/(σ1 h2 + σ2 h1),\n  I(0+) − I∞ = A U0 h1 h2 (σ1 ε2 − σ2 ε1)^2 / [(h2 ε1 + ε2 h1)^2 (h2 σ1 + σ2 h1)].\n\nStep 6: Note on the source impulse at t = 0\n- Because the source is an ideal voltage step, there is an additional impulse current at t = 0 required to instantaneously establish the capacitive fields:\n  Iimp(t) = U0 Ceq δ(t),\n  where the equivalent series capacitance of the two layers is\n  Ceq = A / (h1/ε1 + h2/ε2).\n\n- For t > 0, the impulse vanishes, and the expression above for I(t) applies.\n\n4. Final Answer\n- The current through the switch for t > 0 is a single-exponential Maxwell–Wagner relaxation from an initial finite value I(0+) to the steady DC conduction current I∞ with time constant τ. Explicitly,\n\nI(t) = I∞ + [I(0+) − I∞] e^(−t/τ),  t > 0,\n\nwhere\n- I∞ = A U0 / (h1/σ1 + h2/σ2),\n- τ = (ε1 h2 + ε2 h1)/(σ1 h2 + σ2 h1),\n- I(0+) = I∞ + A U0 h1 h2 (σ1 ε2 − σ2 ε1)^2 / [(h2 ε1 + ε2 h1)^2 (h2 σ1 + σ2 h1)].\n\nEquivalently, in fully expanded closed form,\n\nI(t) = A U0\n[ 1/(h1/σ1 + h2/σ2) + h1 h2 (σ1 ε2 − σ2 ε1)^2 / {(h2 σ1 + σ2 h1)(h2 ε1 + ε2 h1)^2} e^(−t (h2 σ1 + σ2 h1)/(h2 ε1 + ε2 h1)) ],  t > 0.\n\nIf the ideal source impulse at t = 0 is included, add Iimp(t) = U0 Ceq δ(t) with Ceq = A/(h1/ε1 + h2/ε2); otherwise, for t > 0 use the expression above.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ I(t) \\;=\\; I_\\infty + \\big[I(0^+) - I_\\infty\\big] e^{-t/\\tau}\\,,\\quad t>0,\\quad\n\\begin{cases}\nI_\\infty = \\dfrac{A\\,U_0}{\\,h_1/\\sigma_1 + h_2/\\sigma_2\\,},\\\\[8pt]\n\\tau = \\dfrac{\\varepsilon_1 h_2 + \\varepsilon_2 h_1}{\\sigma_1 h_2 + \\sigma_2 h_1},\\\\[10pt]\nI(0^+) = I_\\infty + \\dfrac{A\\,U_0\\,h_1 h_2\\,(\\sigma_1 \\varepsilon_2 - \\sigma_2 \\varepsilon_1)^2}{(h_2 \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 h_1)\\,(h_2 \\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_2 h_1)^2}.\n\\end{cases} } \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- A cube of mass M and side length r slides (without rolling) along a cycloidal valley given by\n  x = R(θ − sin θ), y = R(1 − cos θ), with y measured downward.\n- The valley is coated with a thin layer of snow of surface density σ (mass per area), initially at rest relative to the ground. As the cube slides, snow sticks to the cube. The accreted mass per increment of arc length ds is dm = σ r ds (the cube has width r across the track).\n- We are to find how high the cube reaches on the far side (near θ = 2π) before turning back, in the limit r ≪ R and σ r R ≪ M, keeping terms to first order in r (or equivalently in λR/M where λ ≡ σ r).\n\n2. Approach\n- Treat the motion along the track’s tangent as a variable-mass system with accretion from stationary snow. The tangential dynamics for accretion from rest is\n  m dv/dt = m g sin α − v dm/dt,\n  where α is the local slope angle and v is the speed along the track.\n- Using ds/dt = v and dy/ds = sin α, we convert to an equation in s:\n  m v dv/ds = m g dy/ds − v^2 dm/ds.\n- This linear ODE for v^2 admits the integrating factor m^2, giving a first integral:\n  d/ds (m^2 v^2) = 2 g m^2 dy/ds.\n- Starting from rest and evaluating at the turning point (v = 0) yields the exact turning condition:\n  ∫ m^2 dy = 0 from start to the turning point.\n- With m(s) = M + λ s (λ ≡ σ r) and λ R ≪ M, expand m^2 ≈ M^2 + 2 M λ s to first order, leading to\n  M^2 y_T + 2 M λ ∫ s dy = 0,\n  where y_T is the vertical position (downwards from the cusp) at the turning point.\n- Compute ∫ s dy along the cycloid using its parametrization. Then solve for y_T near the far cusp (θ ≈ 2π), keeping first order in λR/M. Two equivalent routes are possible:\n  - Compute the integral exactly in θ, then expand near θ = 2π.\n  - Split the integral into a full-arch part plus a small tail near the cusp and use a near-cusp asymptotic. Both give the same first-order result.\n\n3. Solution Steps\nStep 1: Cycloid kinematics\n- Parametrization:\n  x = R(θ − sin θ), y = R(1 − cos θ).\n- Differentiate:\n  dx/dθ = R(1 − cos θ), dy/dθ = R sin θ.\n- Arc length element:\n  ds/dθ = √[(dx/dθ)^2 + (dy/dθ)^2] = R √[(1 − cos θ)^2 + sin^2 θ] = R √[2 − 2 cos θ] = 2 R sin(θ/2) for θ ∈ [0, 2π].\n- Arc length from θ = 0:\n  s(θ) = ∫_0^θ 2R sin(φ/2) dφ = 4R[1 − cos(θ/2)].\n- Also, dy = R sin θ dθ.\n\nStep 2: Variable-mass tangential dynamics\n- For accretion from rest relative to the ground, the tangential equation is\n  m dv/dt = m g sin α − v dm/dt.\n- With ds/dt = v and dy/ds = sin α,\n  m v dv/ds = m g dy/ds − v^2 dm/ds.\n- Let u(s) = v^2(s). Then\n  du/ds + 2 (m′/m) u = 2 g dy/ds, where m′ = dm/ds.\n- The integrating factor is μ = m^2, giving\n  d/ds (m^2 v^2) = 2 g m^2 dy/ds.\n- Integrate from the release (s = 0, v = 0, y = 0) to the turning point (s = s_T, v = 0, y = y_T):\n  0 − 0 = 2 g ∫_0^{s_T} m^2 dy ⇒ ∫_0^{s_T} m^2 dy = 0.  (Exact turning condition)\n\nStep 3: Mass model and first-order reduction\n- The cube accretes snow at rate dm = σ r ds, so m(s) = M + λ s with λ ≡ σ r.\n- With λ R ≪ M, expand to first order:\n  m^2(s) = (M + λ s)^2 ≈ M^2 + 2 M λ s.\n- The turning condition becomes\n  M^2 ∫_0^{s_T} dy + 2 M λ ∫_0^{s_T} s dy = 0\n  ⇒ M^2 y_T + 2 M λ ∫_0^{θ_T} s(θ) dy(θ) = 0.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate ∫ s dy along the cycloid\n- Use s(θ) = 4R[1 − cos(θ/2)] and dy = R sin θ dθ:\n  ∫_0^{θ_T} s dy = 4R^2 ∫_0^{θ_T} [1 − cos(φ/2)] sin φ dφ.\n- Define J(θ) = ∫_0^{θ} [1 − cos(φ/2)] sin φ dφ. A convenient change φ = 2t gives\n  J(θ) = − cos θ + (4/3) cos^3(θ/2) − 1/3.\n- Therefore,\n  ∫_0^{θ_T} s dy = 4 R^2 J(θ_T) = 4 R^2[− cos θ_T + (4/3) cos^3(θ_T/2) − 1/3].\n\nStep 5: First-order turning-height condition\n- The height at parameter θ_T is y_T = R[1 − cos θ_T]. Plugging into the first-order condition:\n  M^2 R[1 − cos θ_T] + 8 M λ R^2[− cos θ_T + (4/3) cos^3(θ_T/2) − 1/3] = 0.  (1)\n\nStep 6: Near-cusp expansion (θ_T = 2π − ε, ε ≪ 1)\n- Expand cosines:\n  cos θ_T = cos(2π − ε) ≈ 1 − ε^2/2,\n  cos(θ_T/2) = cos(π − ε/2) = − cos(ε/2) ≈ −(1 − ε^2/8),\n  cos^3(θ_T/2) ≈ −(1 − 3 ε^2/8).\n- Then\n  − cos θ_T + (4/3) cos^3(θ_T/2) − 1/3 ≈ −(1 − ε^2/2) + (4/3)[−1 + 3 ε^2/8] − 1/3\n  = −8/3 + ε^2.\n- Also 1 − cos θ_T ≈ ε^2/2, so y_T ≈ R ε^2/2.\n- Substitute into (1):\n  M^2 R (ε^2/2) + 8 M λ R^2 (−8/3 + ε^2) = 0\n  ⇒ [M^2 R/2 + 8 M λ R^2] ε^2 = (64/3) M λ R^2.\n- Solve for ε^2, then y_T = R ε^2/2:\n  ε^2 = (64/3) λ R^2 / (M R/2 + 8 λ R^2),\n  y_T = R ε^2/2 = (64/3) λ R^2 / (M + 16 λ R).\n\nStep 7: First-order result in λR/M\n- Since λ R ≪ M, expand the denominator:\n  y_T = (64/3) λ R^2 / (M + 16 λ R) ≈ (64/3) λ R^2 / M + O((λ R/M)^2).\n- Restore λ = σ r:\n  y_T ≈ (64/3) (σ r R^2)/M  to first order.\n- The angular shortfall from the cusp is ε ≈ √(2 y_T/R) ≈ √[(128/3)(σ r R)/M], if desired.\n\nInterpretation: y_T is the vertical distance below the far cusp (top) at which the cube turns around. Without snow accretion, it would reach the cusp (y = 0). The sticking snow causes a first-order shortfall proportional to σ r R^2/M.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,y_T \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{64}{3}\\,\\frac{\\sigma\\, r\\, R^{2}}{M}\\,,\\quad\\text{to first order in }\\sigma r R/M\\,} \\]"}

Problem Analysis\n- We are given a rotationally symmetric (central) refractive index n = n(r) and asked to find n(r) in 0 < r < a such that all rays follow the polar-curve trajectory r(θ) = a cos(q θ).\n- Because multiplying n(r) by a constant does not change ray paths (Fermat’s principle is homogeneous in n), the answer is determined only up to an overall dimensionless scale factor n0.\n- The curve has r ≤ a and is not defined at r = 0 for general θ; consistent with the note that n(r) will diverge at r → 0.\n\n2. Approach\nWe use two complementary methods:\n\n- Curvature (ray equation) method: From the ray equation d/ds(n T) = ∇n (with s arc length and T the unit tangent), its normal projection gives n κ = ∇n · N. For a central index n(r), ∇n = (dn/dr) e_r, and using the geometry of the given curve we can express both the Euclidean curvature κ and sinψ (angle between T and e_r) in terms of r, yielding a first-order ODE for n(r), which we integrate.\n\n- Noether/Clairaut invariant (conserved “angular momentum”): For n = n(r), the quantity J = n r^2 dθ/ds = n r sinψ is conserved. Using the geometry of the curve, we compute sinψ along r(θ), solve for n(r) up to the constant J, and then non-dimensionalize to express the result with a dimensionless n0. We also verify that the resulting n reproduces the target dθ/dr implied by r = a cos(q θ).\n\nBoth methods yield the same n(r), providing a consistency check.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Geometry of the given curve\nLet r(θ) = a cos(q θ). Then\n- r_θ ≡ dr/dθ = −a q sin(q θ),\n- r_θθ ≡ d^2r/dθ^2 = −a q^2 cos(q θ) = −q^2 r.\n\nUseful identities:\n- sin^2(q θ) = 1 − cos^2(q θ) = 1 − (r/a)^2,\n- r_θ^2 = a^2 q^2 sin^2(q θ) = q^2 (a^2 − r^2),\n- r^2 + r_θ^2 = r^2 + q^2(a^2 − r^2) = q^2 a^2 − (q^2 − 1) r^2.\n\nThe unit tangent T to the curve parameterized by θ has components proportional to r_θ e_r + r e_θ, so\n- ds/dθ = √(r^2 + r_θ^2),\n- If ψ denotes the angle between T and e_r, then sinψ = |T · e_θ| = r / √(r^2 + r_θ^2) = r / √[q^2 a^2 − (q^2 − 1) r^2].\n\nThe Euclidean curvature κ of a polar curve r(θ) is\nκ = [r^2 + 2 r_θ^2 − r r_θθ] / [r^2 + r_θ^2]^{3/2}.\nSubstituting r_θ and r_θθ above and using sin^2(q θ) = 1 − (r/a)^2,\n- Numerator: r^2 + 2 r_θ^2 − r r_θθ = r^2 + 2 q^2 (a^2 − r^2) + q^2 r^2 = 2 q^2 a^2 + (1 − q^2) r^2,\n- Denominator: [r^2 + r_θ^2]^{3/2} = [q^2 a^2 − (q^2 − 1) r^2]^{3/2}.\nHence\nκ = [2 q^2 a^2 + (1 − q^2) r^2] / [q^2 a^2 − (q^2 − 1) r^2]^{3/2}.\n\nStep 2: Ray equation and ODE for n(r)\nThe ray equation d/ds(n T) = ∇n, projected on the principal normal N, yields\nn κ = ∇n · N.\nFor n = n(r), ∇n = (dn/dr) e_r.

It is convenient to choose C so that n(a) = n0 (a chosen surface value). Evaluating n at r = a:\nn(a) = C √[q^2 a^2 − (q^2 − 1) a^2]/a^2 = C √[a^2]/a^2 = C/a.\nTherefore, C = a n0, and\nn(r) = n0 a √[q^2 a^2 − (q^2 − 1) r^2] / r^2.\n\nIntroducing the dimensionless radius ρ = r/a, we can write this compactly as\nn(r) = n0 √[q^2 − (q^2 − 1) ρ^2] / ρ^2,  with ρ = r/a and 0 < ρ < 1.\n\nAs r → 0, n(r) ~ (n0 q a^2)/r^2, i.e., it diverges like 1/r^2, as the problem statement notes.\n\nStep 4: Independent check via the conserved invariant\nFor a central index n(r), rotational symmetry gives the conserved quantity\nJ = n r^2 dθ/ds = n r sinψ,\nwhere ψ is the angle between T and e_r.

Problem Analysis\n- We have a photon rocket (spaceship) of rest mass M traveling at constant speed v1 (as seen from Earth) through a dilute stream of dust. The dust particles each have rest mass m, move in the same direction at speed v2 (Earth frame), and have uniform number density n (Earth frame).\n- In the spaceship rest frame, dust impacts the windward (front) flat face of area S and undergoes perfectly elastic reflection (specular, reversing the normal momentum with no energy loss in the ship frame).\n- The ship emits photons directly backward at frequency u0 (in the ship frame). Each emitted photon provides forward thrust h u0 / c.\n- Find the number of photons per unit time, N′ (measured in the ship frame), required to exactly balance the dust drag so the ship maintains constant speed.

Approach\n- Work entirely in the spaceship frame (the natural frame for balancing forces and using the given photon frequency u0).\n- Transform the dust flow from the Earth frame to the ship frame using special relativity:\n  - Relative velocity u of dust in the ship frame via relativistic velocity addition.\n  - Number density n′ in the ship frame via Lorentz transformation of the particle 4-current.\n- Compute the dust drag on a flat plate in the ship frame:\n  - Collision rate = (number flux) × area = n′ |u| S.\n  - For a perfectly elastic reflection, each particle reverses its normal momentum; the momentum change per particle is Δp = 2 γ(u) m |u|.\n  - Hence, dust drag magnitude is F_dust = 2 n′ γ(u) m u^2 S.\n- Forward thrust from photons is T = N′ (h u0 / c). Set T = F_dust and solve for N′.\n- Note: The windward face receives incoming dust only if the ship overtakes the dust (v1 > v2). If v1 ≤ v2, there is no flux onto the windward face and the required N′ for that face is zero in this model. This can be encoded via a step function Θ(v1 − v2).\n\n3. Solution Steps\n- Define dimensionless speeds and Lorentz factors:\n  - β1 = v1 / c, γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 − β1^2)\n  - β2 = v2 / c, γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 − β2^2)\n\n- Dust velocity in the ship frame:\n  u = (v2 − v1) / (1 − v1 v2 / c^2) = c (β2 − β1) / (1 − β1 β2)\n\n- Lorentz factor for the relative motion:\n  Using the identity for colinear velocities,\n  γ(u) = 1 / sqrt(1 − u^2 / c^2) = γ1 γ2 (1 − β1 β2)\n\n- Dust number density in the ship frame:\n  Transform the particle 4-current N^μ = (c n, n v2, 0, 0) (Earth frame) to the ship frame via a boost of +v1:\n  n′ c = N′0 = γ1 (c n − v1 n v2 / c) = γ1 c n (1 − β1 β2)\n  Therefore,\n  n′ = γ1 n (1 − β1 β2)\n\n- Collision rate with the windward surface in the ship frame:\n  R = n′ |u| S\n\n- Momentum change per particle for perfectly elastic reflection (normal incidence on a flat wall):\n  Initial momentum p_i = γ(u) m u, final p_f = −γ(u) m u, so the magnitude of the change is\n  |Δp| = 2 γ(u) m |u|\n\n- Dust drag force magnitude on the ship (windward face), combining rate and per-particle change:\n  F_dust = R |Δp| = 2 n′ γ(u) m u^2 S\n\n- Express in Earth-frame parameters.

Approach\nWe use general thermodynamic identities that connect the EOS with heat capacities:\n- From fundamental relations: dU = Cv dT + [T(∂p/∂T)V − p] dV, whence (∂U/∂V)T = T(∂p/∂T)V − p. This and integrability of U(T,V) constrain the functional form of Cv(T,V).\n- We compute Cp − Cv via the response-function identity Cp − Cv = T V α^2/κT, with α = (1/V)(∂V/∂T)p and κT = −(1/V)(∂V/∂p)T, both obtained from the EOS.\n- Imposing that γ = Cp/Cv be independent of T and V will fix any remaining freedom in Cv, and hence give γ.\n\nWe also present a consistent cross-check via the Helmholtz free energy F(V,T), integrating p = −(∂F/∂V)T to obtain U, Cv, and the same constraint.\n\n3. Solution Steps\n\nStep 1: Compute (∂U/∂V)T from the EOS\nUse the identity (derived from dU = T dS − p dV and the Maxwell relation (∂S/∂V)T = (∂p/∂T)V):\n(∂U/∂V)T = T (∂p/∂T)V − p.\n\nGiven p = k V^(−4/5) T^(3/2), we have\n(∂p/∂T)V = (3/2) k V^(−4/5) T^(1/2) = (3/2) p/T.\n\nTherefore:\n(∂U/∂V)T = T × (3/2) p/T − p = (1/2) p.  (1)\n\nStep 2: Use integrability of U(T,V) to constrain Cv(T,V)\nSince U = U(T,V), its mixed partials commute:\n∂/∂T [ (∂U/∂V)T ] = ∂/∂V [ (∂U/∂T)V ] = ∂Cv/∂V.\n\nFrom (1),\n∂/∂T [ (∂U/∂V)T ] = (1/2) (∂p/∂T)V = (1/2) × (3/2) k V^(−4/5) T^(1/2) = (3/4) k V^(−4/5) T^(1/2).\n\nHence:\n(∂Cv/∂V)T = (3/4) k V^(−4/5) T^(1/2).\n\nIntegrating with respect to V at fixed T:\nCv(V,T) = (3/4) k T^(1/2) ∫ V^(−4/5) dV + f(T)\n= (3/4) k T^(1/2) × [ V^(1/5) / (1/5) ] + f(T)\n= (15/4) k V^(1/5) T^(1/2) + f(T),  (2)\nwhere f(T) is an integration “constant” depending only on T.\n\nFor compactness, define H ≡ k V^(1/5) T^(1/2). Then\nCv = (15/4) H + f(T).  (2′)\n\nStep 3: Compute Cp − Cv from response functions\nUse Cp − Cv = T V α^2 / κT.\n\nFrom the EOS, solve V(T,p):\np = k V^(−4/5) T^(3/2) ⇒ V = (k/p)^(5/4) T^(15/8).\n\nThus:\nα ≡ (1/V)(∂V/∂T)p = (15/8) (1/T),\nκT ≡ −(1/V)(∂V/∂p)T. Since V ∝ p^(−5/4) at fixed T, (∂V/∂p)T = −(5/4) V/p, giving\nκT = −(1/V) × [−(5/4) V/p] = 5/(4p).\n\nTherefore:\nCp − Cv = T V α^2 / κT\n= T V [ (15/8)^2 / T^2 ] × [ 4p / 5 ]\n= (225/64) × (4/5) × (p V / T).\n\nUsing p V / T = (k V^(−4/5) T^(3/2)) × V / T = k V^(1/5) T^(1/2) = H, we obtain\nCp − Cv = (45/16) H.  (3)\n\nStep 4: Form γ and impose it be constant\nFrom (2′) and (3):\nCp = Cv + (45/16) H = [(15/4) H + f(T)] + (45/16) H = (105/16) H + f(T).\n\nHence\nγ = Cp/Cv = [ (105/16) H + f(T) ] / [ (15/4) H + f(T) ].  (4)\n\nSince H = k V^(1/5) T^(1/2) depends on both T and V, the only way for γ to be independent of T and V is to eliminate the additional T-only term f(T), otherwise γ would inherit a V-dependence through H competing with f(T). Therefore we must have\nf(T) = 0.\n\nWith f(T) = 0,\nγ = [ (105/16) H ] / [ (15/4) H ] = (105/16) / (15/4) = (105/16) × (4/15) = 7/4.\n\nTherefore γ is the constant 7/4.\n\nStep 5 (Cross-check via Helmholtz free energy)\nAlternatively, integrate p = −(∂F/∂V)T:\nChoose F(V,T) = −5 k V^(1/5) T^(3/2) + h(T) so that −∂F/∂V = k V^(−4/5) T^(3/2).\n\nThen\nS = −(∂F/∂T)V = (15/2) k V^(1/5) T^(1/2) − h′(T),\nU = F + T S = (5/2) k V^(1/5) T^(3/2) + [h(T) − T h′(T)],\nCv = (∂U/∂T)V = (15/4) k V^(1/5) T^(1/2) − T h′′(T) = (15/4) H + f(T) with f(T) = −T h′′(T).\n\nFrom Step 3, Cp − Cv = (45/16) H. Thus γ = 1 + (Cp − Cv)/Cv = 1 + [(45/16) H]/[(15/4) H + f(T)]. For γ to be state-independent, f(T) must vanish, i.e., h′′(T) = 0, which yields the same result γ = 7/4.\n\n4. Conclusion\nUsing the EOS to compute Cv up to a T-only function and combining with Cp − Cv from response functions, the requirement that γ be independent of T and V forces that T-only function to vanish. This fixes the ratio Cp/Cv and yields a unique constant value.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\gamma = \\tfrac{7}{4}} \\]"}

Its neutral-axis length L_beam is slightly larger than l, i.e., the beam has a small excess length (slack) Δ = L_beam − l > 0.\n- A point mass m is applied at midspan (x = l/2). Neglect beam self-weight and friction; slopes are small (|y′| ≪ 1).\n- After static equilibrium under the vertical load m g is reached, the mass is perturbed by a small tangential (along-the-beam) displacement s. Because the beam near midspan has nonzero curvature, this small tangential shift produces a small vertical rise of the mass and hence a restoring gravitational potential, resulting in small oscillations along the tangent direction.\n- Goal: Find the small-oscillation angular frequency ω of this tangential motion.\n\nKey idea: For a small tangential displacement s applied at a point where the beam curvature is κ0, the vertical height change is Δy ≈ (κ0/2) s^2. The gravitational potential then changes by ΔU ≈ (m g/2) κ0 s^2. This is equivalent to a 1-DOF oscillator with effective stiffness k_eff = m g κ0, so ω = sqrt(k_eff/m) = sqrt(g κ0). Thus the task reduces to determining the midspan curvature κ0 at the static equilibrium.\n\n2) Approach\n- Use an energy formulation with an inextensibility constraint for the neutral axis. In the small-slope limit, the arclength S of the deflected centerline satisfies S ≈ l + (1/2)∫_0^l y′(x)^2 dx. The known slack Δ enforces (1/2)∫_0^l y′(x)^2 dx = Δ.\n- Let I = a h^3/12 be the second moment of area. The total potential is\n  Π[y, λ] = (EI/2) ∫_0^l y″(x)^2 dx + m g y(l/2) + λ [ Δ − (1/2) ∫_0^l y′(x)^2 dx ],\n  with simply supported boundary conditions y(0) = y(l) = 0 and y″(0) = y″(l) = 0. The Lagrange multiplier λ has the interpretation of an axial (compressive) force N = λ that arises to accommodate the length constraint.\n- Stationarity with respect to y gives the beam-column equation with a midspan point load:\n  EI y''''(x) + N y''(x) = − m g δ(x − l/2).\n- Solve this linear ODE on the symmetric half-span [0, L] with L = l/2. From the solution, extract the midspan curvature κ0 = y″(L). Use the length constraint (1/2)∫_0^l y′(x)^2 dx = Δ to determine N (equivalently α = sqrt(N/(EI))). Then compute ω = sqrt(g κ0).\n- Two regimes occur depending on how Δ compares with the “natural” end-shortening produced by the classical, no-axial-force (N = 0) central point-load deflection. If Δ is larger, the constrained solution has N > 0 (compressive) and the formulas involve trig functions. If Δ is smaller, the solution has an effective N < 0 (tension) and the formulas involve hyperbolic functions. Both cases are given in parallel below.\n\n3) Solution Steps\n\n3.1 Governing equation and half-span solution\n- Let N = λ and define α = sqrt(N/(E I)) (α can be real or purely imaginary depending on the sign of N; we handle this by separate “trig” and “hyperbolic” forms).\n- On the left half x ∈ [0, L], symmetry implies:\n  y(0) = 0, y″(0) = 0, y′(L) = 0.\n- For N ≥ 0 (compressive case; trig form):\n  The homogeneous equation is y'' = z with z'' + α^2 z = 0 ⇒ z(x) = B sin(α x), using y″(0) = 0.\n  Integrate: y′(x) = −(B/α) cos(α x) + C, and symmetry y′(L) = 0 ⇒ C = (B/α) cos(α L).\n  A jump condition follows from integrating EI y'''' + N y'' = −m g δ across x = L:\n  EI [y'''(L+) − y'''(L−)] = −m g; by symmetry y'''(L+) = − y'''(L−), hence −2 E I y'''(L−) = −m g, i.e.,\n  y'''(L−) = m g/(2 E I).\n  Since y'''(x) = B α cos(α x), we get B α cos(α L) = m g/(2 E I), so\n  B = m g / [2 E I α cos u], with u = α L.\n  The midspan curvature is\n  κ0 = y''(L) = B sin(α L) = (m g)/(2 E I α) tan u.\n\n- For N ≤ 0 (tension-dominated case; let α = sqrt(|N|/(EI)) and use hyperbolic form):\n  The homogeneous equation becomes z'' − α^2 z = 0 ⇒ z(x) = B sinh(α x), with y″(0)=0 ⇒ no cosh term.\n  Integrate: y′(x) = (B/α) cosh(α x) + C and impose y′(L) = 0 ⇒ C = −(B/α) cosh(α L).\n  The jump condition gives EI [y'''(L+) − y'''(L−)] = −m g, with y'''(x) = B α cosh(α x) ⇒ −2 E I B α cosh(α L) = −m g, hence\n  B = m g / [2 E I α cosh u], u = α L.\n  The midspan curvature is\n  κ0 = y''(L) = B sinh(α L) = (m g)/(2 E I α) tanh u.\n\n3.2 Inextensibility (slack) constraint\nIn the small-slope approximation the excess length is\nΔ = (1/2) ∫_0^l y′(x)^2 dx.\nBy symmetry, this equals Δ = ∫_0^L y′(x)^2 dx.\n\n- Compressive (trig) case (N ≥ 0):\n  We found y′(x) = (B/α)[cos u − cos(α x)] on [0, L], so\n  Δ = (B^2/α^2) ∫_0^L [cos u − cos(α x)]^2 dx.\n  A straightforward integral evaluation yields\n  ∫_0^L [cos u − cos(α x)]^2 dx\n  = L + (L/2) sec^2 u − (3/(2 α)) tan u.\n  Using B = m g/[2 E I α cos u], one finds\n  Δ = (m g)^2  L  [1 + (1/2) sec^2 u − (3/(2 u)) tan u]\n       / [4 E^2 I^2 α^4],\n  where u = α L and L = l/2. Equivalently,\n  Δ = (m g)^2 L^5  Φ_trig(u) / [4 E^2 I^2 u^4],  with  Φ_trig(u) = 1 + (1/2) sec^2 u − (3/(2 u)) tan u.\n\n- Tensile (hyperbolic) case (N ≤ 0):\n  Here y′(x) = (B/α)[cosh(α x) − cosh u], and\n  ∫_0^L [cosh(α x) − cosh u]^2 dx = L + (L/2) sech^2 u − (3/(2 α)) tanh u.\n  With B = m g/[2 E I α cosh u], one obtains\n  Δ = (m g)^2  L  [1 + (1/2) sech^2 u − (3/(2 u)) tanh u]\n       / [4 E^2 I^2 α^4],\n  or\n  Δ = (m g)^2 L^5  Φ_hyp(u) / [4 E^2 I^2 u^4], with Φ_hyp(u) = 1 + (1/2) sech^2 u − (3/(2 u)) tanh u.\n\n- Deciding which branch applies:\n  In the limiting case N → 0 (α → 0), both formulas reduce to the classical simply-supported, no-axial-force solution. Expanding about u = 0 gives\n  Φ_trig(u)/u^4 → 1/120 and Φ_hyp(u)/u^4 → 1/120,\n  so the “natural” end-shortening produced by the central point load at N = 0 is\n  Δ0 = (m g)^2 L^5 / (480 E^2 I^2) = (m g)^2 l^5 / (15360 E^2 I^2).\n  If Δ > Δ0, a compressive axial force arises (use the trig branch). If Δ < Δ0, a tensile axial force arises (use the hyperbolic branch).\n\n3.3 Small tangential oscillations of the mass\n- A small tangential displacement s at midspan changes the height by\n  y(L + s) ≈ y(L) + y′(L) s + (1/2) y″(L) s^2 = y(L) + (κ0/2) s^2\n  because y′(L) = 0 by symmetry. Therefore the gravitational potential increases by\n  ΔU ≈ (m g/2) κ0 s^2, so the effective stiffness along s is k_eff = m g κ0.\n- The corresponding small-oscillation angular frequency is\n  ω = sqrt(k_eff/m) = sqrt(g κ0).\n- Substituting κ0 from 3.1 gives\n\n  Compressive (Δ ≥ Δ0; trig):\n  κ0 = (m g)/(2 E I α) tan u,  with u = α L, L = l/2,\n  and α found by solving the scalar constraint\n  Δ = (m g)^2 L^5 Φ_trig(u) / (4 E^2 I^2 u^4),  Φ_trig(u) = 1 + (1/2) sec^2 u − (3/(2 u)) tan u.\n\n  Tensile (Δ ≤ Δ0; hyperbolic):\n  κ0 = (m g)/(2 E I α) tanh u, with u = α L, L = l/2,\n  and α found from\n  Δ = (m g)^2 L^5 Φ_hyp(u) / (4 E^2 I^2 u^4),  Φ_hyp(u) = 1 + (1/2) sech^2 u − (3/(2 u)) tanh u.\n\n- Once u is found numerically from the 1D constraint equation, set α = u/L and evaluate\n  ω = sqrt( g κ0 ) =\n  sqrt{ g (m g)/(2 E I) (L/u) T(u) },\n  where T(u) = tan u (compressive) or T(u) = tanh u (tensile).\n\n3.4 Checks and useful limits\n- Classical no-axial-force limit (α → 0; Δ = Δ0):\n  κ0 → (m g L)/(2 E I) = (m g l)/(4 E I),\n  ω → [ g (m g l)/(4 E I) ]^{1/2}.\n- Second moment of area: I = a h^3/12 must be used in all formulas.\n- Practical algorithm:\n  1) Compute L = l/2 and I = a h^3/12.\n  2) Compare Δ with Δ0 = (m g)^2 L^5/(480 E^2 I^2) to pick the right branch.\n  3) Solve the scalar constraint for u > 0 using a 1D root-finder (bisection/Newton).\n  4) Set α = u/L and evaluate κ0 and ω from the above formulas.\n\n4) Final Answer\n- Define I = a h^3/12 and L = l/2. Let u be the positive solution of the scalar constraint\n\n  If Δ ≥ Δ0 = (m g)^2 L^5/(480 E^2 I^2) (compressive branch):\n  Δ = (m g)^2 L^5 [1 + (1/2) sec^2 u − (3/(2 u)) tan u] / [4 E^2 I^2 u^4].\n\n  If Δ ≤ Δ0 (tensile branch):\n  Δ = (m g)^2 L^5 [1 + (1/2) sech^2 u − (3/(2 u)) tanh u] / [4 E^2 I^2 u^4].\n\n- Then the midspan curvature is\n  κ0 =\n  (m g)/(2 E I) (L/u) tan u  for Δ ≥ Δ0,\n  (m g)/(2 E I) (L/u) tanh u for Δ ≤ Δ0,\n\n- and the small-tangential-oscillation angular frequency of the mass is\n  ω = sqrt(g κ0).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{aligned}\n&I=\\frac{a h^{3}}{12},\\quad L=\\frac{l}{2},\\quad \\Delta_{0}=\\frac{(m g)^{2} L^{5}}{480\\,E^{2} I^{2}},\\ \\text{choose branch by comparing }\\Delta\\ \\text{to }\\Delta_{0},\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{If }\\Delta\\ge\\Delta_{0}:\\ \\text{solve for }u>0\\ \\text{from }\\ \n\\Delta=\\frac{(m g)^{2} L^{5}}{4 E^{2} I^{2} u^{4}}\\!\\left[1+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sec^{2}u-\\frac{3}{2u}\\tan u\\right],\\\\\n&\\hspace{55pt}\\text{then }\\ \\omega=\\Bigg[g\\,\\frac{m g}{2 E I}\\,\\frac{L}{u}\\tan u\\Bigg]^{\\!1/2};\\\\[6pt]\n&\\text{If }\\Delta\\le\\Delta_{0}:\\ \\text{solve for }u>0\\ \\text{from }\\ \n\\Delta=\\frac{(m g)^{2} L^{5}}{4 E^{2} I^{2} u^{4}}\\!\\left[1+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{sech}^{2}u-\\frac{3}{2u}\\tanh u\\right],\\\\\n&\\hspace{55pt}\\text{then }\\ \\omega=\\Bigg[g\\,\\frac{m g}{2 E I}\\,\\frac{L}{u}\\tanh u\\Bigg]^{\\!1/2}.\n\\end{aligned} } \\]"}
{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$. Observations show that the UAV exhibits periodic precession.

The plasma consists of singly ionized monatomic ions (mass m_tot ≈ m_N + m_e, charge +e) and free electrons (mass m_e, charge −e).\n- Because of rotation, ions and electrons experience different centrifugal potentials and acquire different radial density profiles. This produces a net space charge ρ(r) and a cylindrically symmetric radial electric field E_r(r).\n- A UAV of mass m and (effective) charge q0 is co-rotating at radius r0 with angular speed ω. It has no in-plane thrust; hence its in-plane dynamics are governed solely by electric and inertial (fictitious) forces.\n- After a small radial kick (v0 ≪ ω r0), the UAV exhibits small-amplitude, planar, precessional oscillations about r0. We are to find the oscillation (precession) frequency Ω in terms of the system parameters, notably q0 and r0.\n\n2) Approach\nWe combine two key ingredients.\n\n- Plasma equilibrium (Path A): Treat ions and electrons as isothermal Boltzmann species in the rotating frame with effective centrifugal potential U_c = −(1/2) m_s ω^2 r^2. This yields radial density profiles n_s(r) ∝ exp[k m_s r^2], with k = ω^2/(2 k_B T0). Normalizing by the total particle number fixes n_s(r) and thus the local charge density ρ(r) = e[n_i(r) − n_e(r)].\n- UAV small oscillations (Path B): Linearize the UAV’s in-plane dynamics in the rotating frame about the steady co-rotating equilibrium at r0, using the gyroscopic (Coriolis) and centrifugal terms. The linear system yields the epicyclic frequency Ω in terms of the electric-field gradient E_r′(r0). Then eliminate E_r′(r0) using cylindrical Gauss’s law and the equilibrium force balance to express Ω directly in terms of the local space charge ρ(r0). This produces a compact “local control law” for Ω that depends on q0, r0, and ρ(r0).\n\nWe also record a practical small-parameter approximation for ρ(r) when k R^2 ≪ 1 (weak centrifugal stratification).\n\n3) Solution Steps\nStep A. Rotating isothermal profiles and net space charge\n- In the uniformly rotating frame, the centrifugal contribution to the effective potential for species s (mass m_s) is U_c,s = −(1/2) m_s ω^2 r^2. For an isothermal gas at T0, the Boltzmann law (neglecting the self-consistent electrostatic potential in the distribution, as stated) gives\n  n_s(r) = n_{s0} exp[k m_s r^2], with k = ω^2/(2 k_B T0).\n  Let a = k m_tot for ions and b = k m_e for electrons, so\n  n_i(r) = n_{i0} e^{a r^2},  n_e(r) = n_{e0} e^{b r^2}.\n- Normalize by the total particle number in the cylinder. With H ≫ R, assume uniformity along z so the number per unit height is N/H for each species (one electron per ion, with total number N in the volume):\n  N/H = 2π ∫_0^R r n_s(r) dr = π n_{s0} (e^{α_s R^2} − 1)/α_s,\n  where α_i = a, α_e = b. Hence\n  n_{i0} = (N/H) a / [π (e^{a R^2} − 1)],   n_{e0} = (N/H) b / [π (e^{b R^2} − 1)].\n- The net charge density is\n  ρ(r) = e [n_i(r) − n_e(r)] = e [ n_{i0} e^{a r^2} − n_{e0} e^{b r^2} ].\n  Therefore at r = r0,\n  ρ(r0) = e (N/H) [ a e^{a r0^2}/(π (e^{a R^2} − 1)) − b e^{b r0^2}/(π (e^{b R^2} − 1)) ].\n\nStep B. UAV equilibrium and small oscillations in the rotating frame\n- In-plane forces on the UAV in the rotating frame: electric force q0 E_r(r) r̂, Coriolis force −2 m ω ẑ × v_rot, and centrifugal force m ω^2 r r̂. There is no in-plane thrust.\n- Co-rotating equilibrium at radius r0 (UAV at rest in the rotating frame) requires radial force balance:\n  q0 E_r(r0) + m ω^2 r0 = 0.   (1)\n- Linearize the in-plane motion about r0. Let x(t) and y(t) be small displacements in the radial and azimuthal directions, respectively, in the rotating frame. The standard gyroscopic linearization (Hill/Clohessy–Wiltshire form with a general central force) gives\n  ẍ − 2 ω ẏ − ω^2 x − (q0/m) E_r′(r0) x = 0,\n  ÿ + 2 ω ẋ = 0.\n  Seeking normal modes ∝ e^{i Ω t} yields the dispersion relation\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m) E_r′(r0).   (2)\n\nStep C. Eliminate E_r′(r0) in favor of ρ(r0)\n- For a cylindrically symmetric field, Gauss’s law gives\n  ∇·E = (1/r) ∂(r E_r)/∂r = ρ/ε0  ⇒  E_r′(r) + E_r(r)/r = ρ(r)/ε0.   (3)\n- Evaluate (3) at r0 and use the equilibrium (1): E_r(r0) = − m ω^2 r0 / q0. Then\n  E_r′(r0) = ρ(r0)/ε0 − E_r(r0)/r0 = ρ(r0)/ε0 + m ω^2/q0.\n- Insert this in (2):\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (q0/m)[ρ(r0)/ε0 + m ω^2/q0] = 2 ω^2 − (q0/(m ε0)) ρ(r0).   (4)\n\nThus, the precession (epicyclic) frequency is determined locally by the space charge at r0. Using the expression for ρ(r0) from Step A gives a closed form in terms of q0, r0 and known parameters.\n\nStep D. Explicit closed form (exact normalization)\n- Combine (4) with ρ(r0) from Step A:\n  Ω^2 = 2 ω^2 − (q0 e N)/(m ε0 π H) [ a e^{a r0^2}/(e^{a R^2} − 1) − b e^{b r0^2}/(e^{b R^2} − 1) ],\n  with a = k m_tot, b = k m_e, k = ω^2/(2 k_B T0).\n- Hence\n  Ω = [ 2 ω^2 − (q0 e N)/(m ε0 π H) ( a e^{a r0^2}/(e^{a R^2} − 1) − b e^{b r0^2}/(e^{b R^2} − 1) ) ]^{1/2}.\n\nStep E. Useful small-parameter approximation (k R^2 ≪ 1)\n- For weak centrifugal stratification, expand e^{α R^2} and obtain\n  n_s(r) ≈ (N/(H π R^2)) [1 + α_s (r^2 − R^2/2)],  α_i = a = k m_tot, α_e = b = k m_e,\n  so\n  ρ(r0) ≈ e (N/(H π R^2)) k (m_tot − m_e) (r0^2 − R^2/2).\n- Insert into (4):\n  Ω^2 ≈ 2 ω^2 − (q0 e/(m ε0)) (N/(H π R^2)) k (m_tot − m_e) (r0^2 − R^2/2),\n  where k = ω^2/(2 k_B T0).\nThis approximation makes explicit how increasing ω (via k) enhances the mass-separation space charge and thereby shifts Ω, and how the sign of q0 controls whether the electric contribution stiffens or softens the oscillation.\n\nStep F. Remarks on stability\n- Stability requires Ω^2 > 0. From (4), the electric field contribution shifts Ω^2 by − (q0/(m ε0)) ρ(r0). Depending on the sign of q0 and the sign of ρ(r0) at the operating radius r0, the oscillations can be stiffened (larger Ω) or softened (smaller Ω).\n\n4) Final Answer\n- Compact control law (exact): Ω^2 = 2 ω^2 − (q0/(m ε0)) ρ(r0), with ρ(r0) from the rotating isothermal profiles.\n- Fully normalized closed form:\n  ρ(r0) = e (N/H) [ a e^{a r0^2}/(π (e^{a R^2} − 1)) − b e^{b r0^2}/(π (e^{b R^2} − 1)) ],  a = k m_tot, b = k m_e, k = ω^2/(2 k_B T0).\n\nThese yield Ω explicitly in terms of q0, r0 and known parameters.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\Omega \\;=\\;\\left[\n\\,2\\,\\omega^{2}\\;-\\;\\frac{q_{0}\\,e\\,N}{m\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\pi\\,H}\\left(\n\\frac{a\\,e^{a r_{0}^{2}}}{e^{a R^{2}}-1}\n-\\frac{b\\,e^{b r_{0}^{2}}}{e^{b R^{2}}-1}\n\\right)\n\\right]^{\\!1/2}\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad\na=k\\,m_{\\rm tot},\\; b=k\\,m_{e},\\; k=\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{2k_{B}T_{0}}\n}\n\\]"}
