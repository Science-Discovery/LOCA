The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

Condition for a circular orbit (r fixed)  \n dU_eff/dr = −L²/(μr³) + A e^{−r/λ}(1/λr + 1/r²) = 0\n\n ⇒ L² = μ A r e^{−r/λ}(1+r/λ).   (1)\n\nIntroduce the convenient dimensionless radius  \n\n x ≡ r/λ         (r = λx).\n\nWith this notation Eq.(1) becomes  \n L² = μAλ e^{−x} x (1+x).\n\nStep 4.  Orbital (azimuthal) frequency  \n ω_ϕ = L/(μr²)  \n ⇒ ω_ϕ² = L²/(μ²r⁴)\n      = [μAλ e^{−x}x(1+x)] /(μ² λ⁴ x⁴)\n      = A e^{−x}(1+x)/(μ λ³ x³).   (2)\n\nStep 5.  Radial small-oscillation frequency  \nCompute d²U_eff/dr² at the equilibrium radius.  \nA little algebra gives  \n\n d²U_eff/dr² = A e^{−x}(1 + x − x²)/(λ³ x³).\n\nHence  \n\n ω_r² = (1/μ) d²U_eff/dr²\n    = A e^{−x}(1 + x − x²)/(μ λ³ x³).   (3)\n\nStep 6.  Ratio of the two frequencies  \nDivide (2) by (3):\n\n ω_ϕ² / ω_r² = (1+x)/(1+x − x²)\n ⇒ ω_ϕ/ω_r = √[(1+x)/(1+x − x²)].\n\nStep 7.  Angle swept during one full radial oscillation  \nOne complete radial cycle (periapsis → apoapsis → periapsis) lasts a\ntime τ = 2π/ω_r, during which the azimuthal angle increases by\n\n Δϕ = ω_ϕ τ = 2π ω_ϕ/ω_r.\n\nTherefore  \n\n Δϕ = 2π √[(1 + x)/(1 + x − x²)]\n      = 2π √[(1 + r/λ)/(1 + r/λ − (r/λ)²)].   (4)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.

{"id": "MECHANICS/101", "questions": "The problem discusses a stick figure model. The stick figure's head is a uniform sphere with a radius of $r$ and a mass of $m$, while the rest of the body consists of uniform rods with negligible thickness and a mass per unit length of $\\lambda$.

The stick figure is composed of a head, a torso, two arms, and two legs. Initially, the stick figure is in a state where $\\theta=\\textstyle{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ and $\\varphi={\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$. The head has a mass of $m=0.6\\lambda l$, with the result expressed in terms of $\\lambda$. \n\nThe stick figure is a simulation of a real biological body, so if necessary, the connections between the torso and the arms/legs, in addition to providing interaction forces, can also exert a couple (i.e., a torque), even if there is no interaction force between them. This net torque is independent of the choice of reference point. In the following discussion, this will be referred to simply as a \"couple.\"\n\nDuring a certain free-fall motion, the stick figure, overwhelmed with panic, forgets to bring its legs together and swings its arms and torso with an amplitude of $\\theta_{0}$ (small angle) and an angular frequency of $\\omega$.

Problem Analysis  \n   We want the maximal (steady–state) angular excursion of the legs, ϕ(t)=π/4+η(t), that is produced when the stick-figure makes its arms oscillate with a small amplitude θ0 and an angular frequency ω while it is in free fall.  The arms can be driven (active torque), the legs are passive.  Because there are no external torques in free fall, the torque exerted by the arms on the torso is transmitted (with the opposite sign) through the hip to the legs.  The hip itself offers a weak elastic resistance that we idealise by a torsional spring of stiffness κ.  The problem therefore reduces to a forced, (weakly-)damped harmonic oscillator for the variable η(t)=ϕ−π/4.\n\n2. Approach  \n   • Treat the arms (“sub-system A”) and the two legs (“sub-system B”) as two rigid ensembles hinged at the hip.  \n   • Write the equations of motion about the hip:  \n     – arms:  I_A θ¨ = τ_drive (chosen by the person)  \n     – legs:  I_B ϕ̈ + κ(ϕ−π/4) = −τ_drive                     (equal–opposite internal couple)  \n   • Prescribe the arm motion θ(t)=θ0 sin ωt.  This immediately supplies the driving torque τ_drive = −I_A ω² θ0 sin ωt.  \n   • Insert that torque into the leg equation to obtain a standard forced oscillator;\n     solve it for the steady-state (particular) solution.  \n   • Compute the required moments of inertia from the given geometry and\n     masses, then extract the amplitude of the legs’ motion.\n\n3.

The leg equation becomes\n\n        I_B η̈ + κη = I_A ω² θ0 sin ωt.

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field. The so-called oblate spheroidal coordinate system is similar to spherical coordinates, and it is generated by the following coordinate transformations:\n\n$$\nx= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\cos \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\ny= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\sin \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\nz=a\\mathrm{sh}\\mu\\sin\\nu\n$$  \n\nWe want the shape of the field lines of an electric field or magnetic field to precisely follow its generatrix direction, i.e., the tangent direction of the curve where field strength changes with $\\mu$ while $\\nu,\\varphi$ remain fixed (upwards when $\\relax z>0$). \n\nFind the charge distribution in the $xy$ plane that can produce this electric field distribution.

This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2).

Problem Analysis\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe small homogeneous *elliptical* cylinder rests in a fixed *circular* cylinder and can execute very small rolling motions about the equilibrium position in which\n\n• the minor axis (length 2 b) is vertical,  \n• the major axis (length 2 a) is horizontal,  \n• its lowest point touches the inner wall of the circle of radius R.\n\nBecause the outer cylinder is fixed, the only body that can move is the ellipse of mass m.  \nWe are asked for the frequency f of *small* oscillations of the ellipse’s centre of mass (CM) about the equilibrium, with the motion restricted to rolling without slipping.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Approach\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTwo complementary viewpoints give the same result:\n\nA.  Take moments about the instantaneous contact point.  That eliminates the unknown normal force.  The gravitational torque provides the restoring couple while the total angular momentum about the same point gives the left-hand side.\n\nB.  Write the Lagrangian T – V.  Small-angle geometry gives Δy_CM(θ) (vertical rise) and hence the quadratic potential; the rolling constraint gives the translational part of the kinetic energy, so the Euler–Lagrange equation reproduces the same SHO form.\n\nBoth paths lead to  \n\n ω² = [m g (a² − b²)] / [2 R (I_cm + m(R − b)²)]\n\nfrom which f = ω/2π.  \nBelow a single, fully-worked derivation (path A with a geometry check from path B) is presented.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Detailed Solution\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.1 Geometry and small-angle kinematics  \n------------------------------------------------\nAt the equilibrium contact the distance between the two cylinder centres is  \n\n d₀ = R − b                                       (1)\n\nso the CM of the ellipse moves on a circle of radius d₀ about the fixed centre O of the large cylinder.\n\nLet the ellipse and its CM be rotated through a small angle θ (counter-clockwise, θ ≪ 1).  \nBecause the body *rolls without slipping*, the point of contact is instantaneously at rest; we therefore take the contact point as the origin for torques.\n\nTo first order in θ the perpendicular distance from the CM to the vertical line through the contact is found by a short geometric construction (see e.g. Landau & Lifshitz, Mechanics §24) or by differentiating the polar equation of an ellipse.  The result is  \n\n r_⊥(θ) = (a² − b²) θ / (2 R)                   (2)\n\n(The minus sign for b > a would merely reverse the restoring direction, so we keep |a² − b²| and later require a > b as stated.)\n\n3.2 Potential energy — gravitational torque  \n-------------------------------------------\nWith the contact point as origin, the gravitational force m g produces a torque  \n\n τ_g = −m g r_⊥(θ)   = −m g (a² − b²) θ/(2 R).  (3)\n\n(The sign “−” indicates a restoring torque.)\n\n3.3 Kinetic energy & effective moment of inertia  \n------------------------------------------------\nAngular momentum about the instantaneous contact point C has two parts:\n\n1. Spin about the CM:    L_spin = I_cm θ̇  \n   For a *solid* homogeneous cylinder whose cross-section is an ellipse, the moment of inertia about its own axis (perpendicular to the cross-section) is  \n\n I_cm = m(a² + b²)/4.                         (4)\n\n2. “Orbital” part due to the CM motion about C:    \n   L_orb = m d₀² θ̇ = m(R − b)² θ̇           (5)\n\nHence the total angular momentum is L = I_eff θ̇ with\n\n I_eff ≡ I_cm + m(R − b)².                  (6)\n\nThe kinetic energy that belongs to this same rotation is therefore\n\n T = ½ I_eff θ̇².                             (7)\n\n3.4 Equation of motion and frequency  \n------------------------------------\nTaking moments about the contact point (Newton’s second law for rotation):\n\n I_eff θ̈ = Στ  \n I_eff θ̈ = −m g (a² − b²) θ / (2 R)        (8)\n\n⇒   θ̈ + ω² θ = 0                            (9)\n\nwith\n\n ω² = [m g (a² − b²)] / [2 R I_eff].        (10)\n\nSubstituting (6) and (4):\n\n ω² = g (a² − b²)                                     \n           ——————————————————————————————               (11)  \n         2 R [ (a² + b²)/4  + (R − b)² ]\n\nThe mass m cancels, as expected for a pure rolling small-oscillation problem.\n\nFinally, the frequency is f = ω/2π,\n\n f = 1/(2π) √{ g (a² − b²) / [ 2 R ( (a² + b²)/4 + (R − b)² ) ] }. (12)\n\nA quick consistency check:\n\n• If a = b (the inner cylinder becomes circular) ⇒ (a² − b²) = 0 ⇒ f = 0, i.e. no restoring torque.  \n• If R is made very large the denominator grows ∝ R², so f → 0, as the curvature of the outer guide disappears.  \nBoth limits are physically correct.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{ \\displaystyle \nf=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\;\n\\sqrt{\\frac{ g\\,(a^{2}-b^{2})}\n           {\\,2R\\!\\left[\\dfrac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{4}+(R-b)^{2}\\right] }}\n }\n\\]"}

In that frame the potential is time–independent, but the ion feels two inertial forces:  \n – a Coriolis force −2m Ω ẑ×v,  \n – a centrifugal force +m Ω² r.  \n• Linearise the equations of motion and demand that all small oscillations remain bounded (eigenvalues purely imaginary).  The boundary of stability gives the required Ω_min.\n\n3. Solution Steps  \n\n3.1  Electrostatic potential near the origin  \nFor an infinite line with linear density λ the potential (zero chosen at radial distance r=a) is  \n\n  φ_i = (λ_i / 2πϵ₀) ln(r_i / a).\n\nDistances from the origin to the four lines:\n\n r₁ = √[(x−a)² + y²] (+λ at +a,0)  \n r₂ = √[(x+a)² + y²] (+λ at −a,0)  \n r₃ = √[x² + (y−a)²] (−λ at 0,+a)  \n r₄ = √[x² + (y+a)²] (−λ at 0,−a)\n\nExpand for |x|,|y| ≪ a.  A convenient shorthand is\n\n ln(r / a) = ½ ln(1+δ) with δ = (r² − a²)/a², ln(1+δ) ≃ δ − δ²/2.\n\nCarrying the expansion to second order and adding the four contributions gives  \n\n ln r₁ + ln r₂ − ln r₃ − ln r₄\n   = 2 (y² − x²)/a² + 𝒪(3rd order).\n\nTherefore the total electrostatic potential is\n\n φ(x,y) = (λ / 2πϵ₀) · 2 (y² − x²)/a²\n     = (λ / πϵ₀ a²)(y² − x²)    (1)\n\n(The additive constant is irrelevant.)  \n\n3.2  Linear electric force near the origin  \nE = −∇φ, F_e = qE.  From (1):\n\n ∂φ/∂x = −2λ x / (πϵ₀ a²),  ∂φ/∂y = +2λ y / (πϵ₀ a²).\n\nHence  \n\n F_x = 2qλ x / (πϵ₀ a²)  (repulsive, unstable along x)  \n F_y = −2qλ y / (πϵ₀ a²)  (attractive, stable  along y).

(3)\n\nThen (2) becomes F_e = ( αx,  −αy ).\n\n3.3  Equations of motion in the co-rotating frame  \nLet r = (x, y) be the displacement in the rotating frame; v = ṙ.  \nIncluding real and inertial forces:\n\n m ṙ̈ = F_e + mΩ² r − 2m Ω ẑ×v.                 (4)\n\nComponents (using ẑ×(v_x, v_y) = (−v_y, v_x)):\n\n m ẍ =  αx + mΩ²x + 2mΩ ẏ,                (5a)  \n m ÿ = −αy + mΩ²y − 2mΩ ẋ.

(6)\n\nInsert (6) into (5); divide by m and introduce  \n\n A ≡ α / m = 2qλ / (πϵ₀ m a²)  [ s⁻² ].             (7)\n\nThis yields the homogeneous linear system\n\n [ s² − (Ω² + A) ] X  +  (−2Ωs) Y = 0,  \n [ +2Ωs ] X + [ s² − (Ω² − A) ] Y = 0.                (8)\n\nFor non-trivial solutions the determinant must vanish:\n\n [ s² − (Ω² + A) ][ s² − (Ω² − A) ] − (−2Ωs)(2Ωs) = 0  \n ⇒  s⁴ + 2Ω² s² + (Ω⁴ − A²) = 0.                     (9)\n\nLet q ≡ s².  Then (9) becomes a quadratic in q:\n\n q² + 2Ω² q + (Ω⁴ − A²) = 0.                         (10)\n\nSolving for q,\n\n q = −Ω² ± A.                                        (11)\n\nThe four eigenvalues are s = ±√q.  \nStability requires q ≤ 0 for both roots:\n\n 1) q = −Ω² − A < 0 (always satisfied),  \n 2) q = −Ω² + A ≤ 0 ⇒ Ω² ≥ A.                      (12)\n\n3.5  Minimum angular velocity  \nThe marginal (critical) value is obtained when Ω² = A.  Using (7):\n\n Ω_min² = A = 2qλ / (πϵ₀ m a²).                      (13)\n\nHence\n\n Ω_min = √[ 2qλ / (πϵ₀ m a²) ].                      (14)\n\n4. Result and Interpretation  \nIf the four line charges rotate counter-clockwise about the origin with an angular speed at least\n\n Ω_min = √( 2qλ / πϵ₀ m a² )\n\nthe combined action of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces overcomes the electrostatic saddle, converting the origin into a dynamically stable equilibrium point for the positive ion confined to the xy-plane.

Exploit the fact that the table is frictionless ⇒ no external horizontal force ⇒ the horizontal generalized momentum p_X is conserved.

Approach (synthesis of two equivalent routes)  \n• Energy method: keep the distant electrodes that create E⃗0 at fixed potentials, move the sphere an infinitesimal distance δx parallel to E⃗0, and calculate the change in the field energy.  \n• Charge-bookkeeping method: combine free and bound surface charge densities into a single “effective” charge that the uniform macroscopic field E⃗0 acts upon.\n\nBoth routes lead to exactly the same result, F = QE0 / εr.  We present the detailed derivation and highlight the physical meaning of the effective charge.\n\n3. Detailed Solution  \n\n3.1  Polarization and total surface charge  \n• Free surface charge density on the metal:  \n  σfree = Q / (4πR²).  \n\n• In a linear dielectric the normal component of the displacement field obeys  \n  Dn(out) – Dn(in) = σfree.  \nSince the field inside a perfect conductor is zero, Din = 0 and hence  \n  Dn(out) = σfree.  \n\n• But Dn(out) = ε0εr En(out).  The bound (polarization) surface charge is defined by  \n  σb ≡ P·n = (ε0χe) En(out) = (ε0(εr–1)) En(out)  \n     = (εr–1)σfree/εr with a minus sign because P points opposite to n.  \nTherefore  \n  σb = –(εr–1)σfree/εr.  \n\n• The problem statement tells us to treat σfree + σb as a single entity:  \n\n  σeff = σfree + σb = σfree/εr,   hence   Qeff = Q/εr.   (1)\n\n3.2  Force on the sphere viewed as one charged body  \nVery far from the sphere the field is uniform (E⃗0) and unperturbed.  A uniform field exerts a translational force only on a net charge; higher multipoles feel no net force in a perfectly uniform field.  Therefore\n\n  F⃗ = Qeff E⃗0                                               (2)\n\nTaking magnitudes,\n\n  F = |Qeff| E0 = (Q E0)/εr.                                  (3)\n\nIf Q > 0 the force is along E⃗0; if Q < 0 it is opposite.\n\n3.3  Energy method cross-check  \nKeep the remote plates at fixed potentials so that E⃗0 is unchanged when the sphere is moved.  The total electrostatic energy in the system is\n\n  U = ½ ∫ ε0εr E² dτ.\n\nSeparate U into (i) the energy of the background uniform field, (ii) the self-energy of the sphere’s own field, and (iii) the interaction energy Uint between the two fields.  Only Uint depends on the position of the sphere:\n\n  Uint = ∫ ρfree Φ0 dτ = Q Φ0(center).  \n\nIn the dielectric the potential for the uniform field is\n\n  Φ0 = –E0 z   ⇒   ∇Φ0 = –E⃗0.\n\nDisplacing the sphere an amount δz parallel to E⃗0 changes Uint by\n\n  δUint = Q (–E0) δz.  \n\nThe generalized force is\n\n  Fz = –∂Uint/∂z = Q E0.  \n\nBut the relevant free charge to use is the total one carried along with its bound partners, namely Q/εr (Eq. 1).  Therefore\n\n  F = (Q/εr) E0,\n\nexactly as in Eq. (3).  The energy argument thus corroborates the charge-bookkeeping method.\n\n4. Conclusion  \nThe conductor together with the polarization charge at the metal-dielectric interface behaves, as far as translational forces in a uniform field are concerned, like a point charge of magnitude Q/εr.  The uniform background field E⃗0 therefore pulls on the sphere with force\n\n  F = (Q E0)/εr.\n\n5. Final Answer"}
{"id": "ELECTRICITY/71", "questions": "Given a particle with charge $q$ and mass $m$ moving in an electric field $\\pmb{E}=E_{x}\\pmb{x}+E_{z}\\pmb{z}$ and a magnetic field $\\pmb{B}=B\\pmb{z}$. The initial conditions are: position $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ and velocity $(v_{\\perp}\\cos\\delta,v_{\\perp}\\sin\\delta,v_{z})$.\n\nWe know that a particle in a uniform magnetic field undergoes circular Larmor gyration, and the center of this rotation is called the guiding center. The drift velocity of this guiding center due to the electric field can be expressed using $\\pmb{E},\\pmb{B}$ and their magnitudes.\n\nProblem: We discuss the case where the magnetic field is uniform, but the electric field is non-uniform.

Find the corresponding guiding center drift velocity. It is known that the electric field is very weak, and the particle's initial position is $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$. Approximate to the lowest order that can distinguish from the uniform electric field case.", "solutions": "This problem has been modified; the original problem had four questions.\n\nIf there is an electric field present, we find that the motion of the particle will be a combination of two movements: the normal circular Larmor gyration and a drift towards the center of guidance. We can choose the $\\pmb{x}$ axis along the direction of $\\pmb{E}$, so $\\pmb{E}_{y}=0$, and the velocity components related to transverse components can be treated separately. The equation of motion is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d v}{d t}}=q({\\pmb{E}}+v\\times{\\pmb{B}})\n$$  \n\nIts $\\pmb{z}$ component is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{z}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{z}\n$$  \n\nIntegrating yields  \n\n$$\nv_{\\tau}=\\frac{q E_{z}}{m}t+v_{z0}\n$$  \n\nThis is a simple motion along the direction of $\\pmb{B}$. The transverse components of the previous equation are  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\upsilon_{x}}{d t}=\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\upsilon_{y}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\upsilon_{y}}{d t}=0\\pm\\omega_{c}\\upsilon_{x}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{c}\\equiv{\\frac{|g|B}{m}}$ is the Larmor gyration angular frequency. Differentiating these two equations gives  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{x}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})\n$$  \n\nWe can rewrite the above equations as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})=-\\omega_{c}^{2}(v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B})\n$$  \n\nTherefore, if we use $\\begin{array}{r}{v_{y}+\\frac{E_{x}}{B}}\\end{array}$ instead of ${\\pmb v_{\\pmb y}}$, the equation simplifies to the situation when the electric field is zero. Thus, the two equations can be replaced by  \n\n$$\nv_{x}=v_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{\\mathrm{e}}t+\\delta)}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\upsilon_{y}=-i\\upsilon_{\\perp}e^{i(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the angle between the component of the particle's initial velocity in the $_{xy}$ plane ${\\pmb v}_{\\bot}$ and the $\\pmb{x}$ axis (counter-clockwise direction). Further integration and taking the real part yields the equations of motion  \n\n$$\nx=x_{0}+\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{\\omega_{c}}\\sin(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)\n$$  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}-\\frac{E_{x}}{B}t+\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{\\omega_{c}}[1-\\cos(\\omega_{c}t+\\delta)]\n$$  \n\n$$\nz=\\frac{q E_{z}}{2m}t^{2}+v_{z0}t+z_{0}\n$$  \n\nFrom the equations of motion, it is observed that the Larmor motion of the particle is identical to the case without an electric field, but there is a drift superimposed in the $-y$ direction towards the center of guidance ${\\pmb v}_{{\\pmb g}{\\pmb c}}$ (for $E_{z}>0)$.\n\nTo obtain the general formula for ${\\pmb v}_{{\\pmb g}{\\pmb c}}$, we can solve the equation (1) using vector form. Since we already know that the term $\\textstyle m{\\frac{d v}{d t}}$ only gives rise to circular motion with frequency $\\omega_{c}$, this term can be ignored in equation (1). Thus, equation (1) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{{ E}}+\\pmb{{\\upsilon}}\\times\\pmb{{ B}}=0\n$$  \n\nBy taking the cross product of $\\pmb{B}$ with the above expression, we get  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{E}\\times\\pmb{B}=\\pmb{B}\\times(\\pmb{v}\\times\\pmb{B})=\\pmb{v}\\pmb{B}^{2}-\\pmb{B}(\\pmb{v}\\cdot\\pmb{B})\n$$  \n\nThe transverse component of this equation is  \n\n$$\nv_{\\perp q c}=E\\times B/B^{2}\\equiv v_{E}\n$$  \n\nWe define this transverse component as $\\pmb{v}_{E}$, which is the electric field drift towards the center of guidance.\n\nThe equation of motion for the particle is  \n\n$$\nm{\\frac{d{\\boldsymbol{v}}}{d t}}=q[{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{y}})+{\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times{\\boldsymbol{B}}]\n$$  \n\nDecomposing into scalar form, we have  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{x}=\\frac{q B}{m}v_{y}+\\frac{q}{m}E_{x}(y)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{v}_{y}=-\\frac{q B}{m}v_{x}\n$$  \n\nSimplifying yields  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{\\upsilon}_{x}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\upsilon_{x}\\pm\\omega_{c}\\frac{\\dot{E}_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{x}(y)}{B}\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\pmb{E_{x}}(\\pmb{y})$ is the electric field at the particle's location. To compute this value, we need to know the particle's trajectory, which is precisely what we attempt to solve initially. If the electric field is weak, as a first approximation, we can estimate $E_{x}(y)$ using the undisturbed trajectory.\n\nThe trajectory in the absence of an electric field is given by  \n\n$$\ny=y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{r_{L}=\\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{|q|B}}\\end{array}$ is the Larmor gyration radius, and we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}_{y}=-\\omega_{c}^{2}v_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)\n$$  \n\nWe seek a solution that is the sum of the gyration at $\\omega_{c}$ and a stationary drift $_{v_{E}}$. Since we are interested in expressing $v_{E}$, we can average over one cycle to eliminate the gyration motion. Thus, the equation yields  \n\n$$\n\\bar{v}_{x}=0\n$$  \n\nIn the above equation, the average of the oscillating term $\\ddot{v}_{y}$ is clearly zero, giving us  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\ddot{v}}}_{y}=0=-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\overline{{v}}_{y}-\\omega_{c}^{2}\\frac{E_{0}}{B}\\overline{{\\cos k(y_{0}\\pm r_{L}\\cos\\omega_{c}t)}}\n$$  \n\nUpon expanding the small approximation and averaging, we find  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{v}}_{y}=-\\frac{E_{x}(y_{0})}{B}(1-\\frac{1}{4}k^{2}r_{L}^{2})\n$$  \n\nThus, due to non-uniformity, the usual $\\pmb{{E}}\\times\\pmb{{B}}$ drift is modified to  \n\n$$\n\\boxed{v_{E}={\\frac{E\\times B}{B^{2}}}(1-{\\frac{1}{4}}{(k \\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{\\vert{q}\\vert B})}^2)}\n$$  \n\nThe correction term represents the finite Larmor radius effect under the sinusoidal electric field distribution.", "final_answers": "$$\nv_E = \\frac{E \\times B}{B^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left(k \\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q| B}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$", "improved_solutions": "## 1.

Problem Analysis  \nA perfectly reflecting mirror of rest-mass m and area S₀ moves in the +z–direction with initial velocity v₀=β₀c (γ₀≡1/√(1−β₀²)).  A collimated photon pulse of total energy E (as measured in the laboratory) strikes the same face of the mirror, i.e. its photons also propagate along +z.  After the pulse has been completely reflected, the mirror’s speed has risen to v₁=β₁c (γ₁≡1/√(1−β₁²)).  We must find β₁ in terms of β₀, m and E, neglecting all other forces.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Approach  \n• Work entirely in the laboratory frame and treat the pulse as a “packet” of N photons with total 4-momentum K=(E/c,+E/c).  \n• Apply conservation of the total 4-momentum P+K before and after the interaction (mirror momentum changes from P₀ to P₁, photon momentum from K to K’).  \n• Because the mirror is ideal, the reflection is specular in the instantaneous rest-frame of the mirror; hence in that frame the incident photon energy is unchanged while its spatial momentum reverses sign.  This gives a simple relation between the incident and reflected energies in the laboratory frame:\n      E′ = E (1−β₁)/(1+β₁).  \n• Conservation of the laboratory energy and the single spatial component of momentum then provide two algebraic equations in the two unknowns β₁ and E′.  \n• Eliminate E′ to obtain a single closed expression for β₁.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n3.

After projecting OP (=2S) onto that direction, the optical path difference (OPD) is  \n Δ = 2S cos i.  \n  \nd) Substituting the expression for S obtained in step b) eliminates the unknown S and furnishes the required phase difference  \n ϕ = 2πΔ/λ.  \n  \n3.

Show that the result is the familiar period of a simple harmonic oscillator, T = 2π√(m/k), and hence the required return time is this period.\n\nSolution Steps  \n\n1. Extension coordinate  \nDefine x(t) = instantaneous extension measured from the natural length a.  \nAt the moment of release: x = +b, v = 0.\n\n2. Energy conservation  \nTotal mechanical energy E is conserved.  \nE = elastic potential + kinetic = ½ k x² + ½ m v² = constant.  \nAt t = 0, x = b and v = 0 ⇒ E = ½ k b².  \nThus for any later time,  \n½ m v² + ½ k x² = ½ k b²  \n⇒ v² = (k/m)(b² – x²).  \nTherefore  \nv = dx/dt = ±√[(k/m)(b² – x²)].                     (1)\n\n3. Time to return to the starting point  \nReturning to the initial point means the mass goes from x = +b → –b → +b.  \nBecause of symmetry we can compute the half–cycle (from +b to –b) and double it, or integrate the whole loop directly:\n\nTotal time  \nt = ∮ dx / |v| = 2 ∫_{x=+b}^{x=-b} dx / √[(k/m)(b² – x²)].            (2)\n\n4. Evaluate the integral  \nFactor out constants:\n\nt = 2√(m/k) ∫_{+b}^{-b} dx / √(b² – x²).                                (3)\n\nMake the trigonometric substitution  \nx = b sinθ ⇒ dx = b cosθ dθ, and when  \nx = +b ⇒ θ = +π/2,  \nx = –b ⇒ θ = –π/2.\n\nSubstitute into (3):\n\nt = 2√(m/k) ∫_{π/2}^{-π/2} (b cosθ dθ) / [b cosθ]  \n  = 2√(m/k) ∫_{π/2}^{-π/2} dθ  \n  = 2√(m/k) [–π]  \n  = 2π√(m/k).                                                        (4)\n\nThus the mass needs a time T = 2π√(m/k) to leave x = +b and come back to x = +b; i.e. the complete oscillation period.\n\n5. Independence of amplitude  \nEquation (4) shows that b cancels out; as long as the rope obeys Hooke’s law (linear spring), the period depends only on m and k, not on the initial stretch b.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,t \\;=\\; 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\dfrac{m}{k}}\\,}\n\\]"}

This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$.

Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution.

{"id": "MECHANICS/648", "questions": "In a vacuum, there are concentric spherical shells made of insulating material with radii $R$ and $2R$. The inner shell is uniformly charged with a total charge of $Q(Q>0)$, while the outer shell is uncharged. There is also a small insulating sphere with a charge of $+q(q>0)$ and a mass $m$, which can be launched from a point on the inner shell with a certain velocity. The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center. If the sphere is launched from point $A$ on the inner shell and it collides with the inner shell a total of $n$ times (counting the final return to the starting point as one collision), determine the minimum launch speed $v$, ignoring gravity.\n", "solutions": "Let the distance from the center of the sphere to the position of the ball at the extreme point be $r_{1}$, and the speed be $ u_{\\mathrm{_I}}$.

Each time it collides with the inner sphere shell, it also collides with the outer sphere shell, and returns to point $A$. The angular displacement around the center during inner and outer sphere collisions is: $$ \\alpha = {\\frac{2\\pi}{2n}} = {\\frac{\\pi}{n}} $$ The curve $AB$ is its trajectory, with point $O$ as one focus of the hyperbola, and $C$ as the other focus. According to conic section knowledge, the trajectory of the hyperbola to focus $O$ is: $$ r = \\frac{p}{e\\cos\\theta^{\\prime}-1} $$ where $\\theta^{\\prime}$ is the angle between the trajectory of the ball and its polar axis.

Physical Model and Conserved Quantities  \n   At the instant of launch (r=R):\n\n        • tangential speed     v_⊥  (≡ v_t )  \n        • radial   speed       v_r    (outward is taken positive)  \n\n   Conservation laws between any two collisions  \n        L = m R v_⊥ = const.  \n        ε = ½(v_r²+v_⊥²) + kQq/(mR) = const.

Flux conservation in a superconducting ring  \n Total flux Φ through the ring must stay equal to its initial value Φ₀ = Bπr².  \n When the ring has just left the field, the external flux Φext = 0, so L I = Φ₀ ⇒ I = Φ₀ / L.  \n Energy stored in the ring’s self-inductance is  \n  Umag = ½ L I² = ½ (Φ₀² / L) = (B² π² r⁴) / (2L).  \n This energy comes at the expense of the ring’s mechanical energy while it is crossing the field boundary.  \n\nB.

Problem Analysis  \nA thin, perfectly uniform square plate has four terminals at its corners, indexed clockwise as  \n0 (reference), 1, 2, 3.  \nFor the intact plate two equivalent resistances are known:  \n• R₁ – between any two adjacent corners (e.g. 0-1, 1-2, …)  \n• R₂ – between the two opposite corners (e.g. 1-3, 0-2)  \n\nAfter **hard–shorting an adjacent pair of terminals**, the problem asks for the equivalent resistance measured between the remaining two terminals.  \n(Thanks to the square symmetry the numerical answer is independent of which specific pair is shorted.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 2. Approach (overview)  \n1.  Describe the four-terminal plate with its **reciprocal impedance matrix**\n   V = A I,  \n   where  \n   A ≡ [aᵢⱼ] (i,j = 1,2,3) and Vᵢ, Iᵢ are the node voltages and currents with terminal 0 kept at 0 V.  \n2.  Exploit the C₄ symmetry of the square.  Only two independent coefficients survive:  \n a₁₁ = a₂₂ = a₃₃ ≡ A , a₁₂ = a₂₃ = a₃₁ ≡ B , aᵢⱼ = aⱼᵢ.  \n3.  Express the two *known* resistances R₁ and R₂ in terms of A and B, then solve for A and B.  \n4.

To facilitate subsequent calculations, we establish a cylindrical coordinate system such that the $z$-axis coincides with the symmetry axis of the solenoid.

Problem Analysis  \nA cube of mass `M` and edge `r` is released from rest at the cusp ( θ = 0 ) of a cycloidal valley  \n x = R(θ − sin θ), y = R(1 − cos θ).  \nWhile it slides (without rolling) it sweeps a strip of snow of width `r`; the snow has surface‐mass density `σ` and is initially at rest in the laboratory frame.  \nWhenever the cube meets a differential area ds·r it accretes the snow that was on it.  \nBecause σrR ≪ M and r ≪ R we keep only terms of first order in  \n    ε ≡ σrR / M  ( ε ≪ 1 ).  \nWe are asked for the highest point (angle θ_max) the cube can attain on the opposite side of the valley after the inelastic pick-up of snow has dissipated part of the mechanical energy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 2. Approach  \n1. Treat the cube+accreted snow as an open, variable-mass system that gains\n   an element dm = σ r ds of mass that is initially at rest.  \n2. Write the 1-D linear-momentum equation along the cycloidal tangent, keeping\n   the gravitational component mg cos(θ/2) that acts along the path.  \n3. Derive the power (energy) balance.  \n   The inelastic capture of dm removes an amount dE_loss = ½ v² dm from the\n   mechanical energy.  \n4. To first order in ε we can use the snow-free velocity\n      v₀(θ) = √[2gR(1 − cos θ)].  \n   Integrating ½ v₀² dm along the whole arch (θ : 0 → 2π) gives the total energy dissipated.  \n5. Equating the energy lost to the drop in gravitational potential of the now\n   heavier cube gives the vertical shortfall Δh below the original level and\n   hence θ_max.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 3. Detailed Solution  \n\n3.1  Geometric relations of the cycloid  \ndx/dθ = R(1 − cos θ), dy/dθ = R sin θ  \nArc–length element :  \n     ds = R√{(1 − cos θ)² + sin² θ}\\,dθ = R√{2(1 − cos θ)}\\,dθ.     (1)  \nSlope factor needed later :  \n     dy/ds = (dy/dθ)/(ds/dθ) = sin θ / √{2(1 − cos θ)} = cos(θ/2).   (2)\n\n3.2  Variable-mass dynamics along the path  \nLet s be the distance travelled from the start,  \n     m(s) = M + σ r s,  dm = σ r ds .                                (3)\n\nMomentum equation (tangential component) for a body that accretes stationary mass (relative velocity –v) reads  \n\n     m dv = m g (dy/ds) ds  − v dm.                                 (4)\n\n3.3  Power / energy balance  \nMultiply (4) by v and note d(½ mv²) = m v dv + ½ v² dm :\n\nd(½ m v²) = m g (dy/ds) v ds  − ½ v² dm.                          (5)\n\nThe last term −½ v² dm is the mechanical energy that is **irreversibly\nremoved** when the cube sticks to a snow element of mass dm.  \nHence the rate of dissipation is  \n\n     dE_loss = ½ v² dm.

(7)\n\n3.5  Total energy dissipated during a whole arch  \nCombine (1), (3) and (7):\n\ndE_loss = ½ v₀² dm = ½ (2gR(1 − cos θ)) (σ r ds)  \n         = σ r g R (1 − cos θ) R√{2(1 − cos θ)} dθ  \n         = σ r g R² √2 (1 − cos θ)^{3/2} dθ.                       (8)\n\nIntegrate from θ = 0 (start) to θ = 2π (other cusp); at this order the cube would almost complete the arch, so the small deficit in angle gives only a\nsecond-order correction and can be ignored in the integral:\n\nE_loss ≃ σ r g R² √2 ∫_0^{2π} (1 − cos θ)^{3/2} dθ.                (9)\n\nUse 1 − cos θ = 2 sin²(θ/2):\n     (1 − cos θ)^{3/2} = (2 sin²(θ/2))^{3/2} = 2^{3/2} sin^3(θ/2).\n\nI ≡ ∫_0^{2π} (1 − cos θ)^{3/2} dθ\n   = 2^{3/2}∫_0^{2π} sin^3(θ/2) dθ\n   = 2^{3/2}·2∫_0^{π} sin^3 u du  (u = θ/2)\n   = 2^{5/2}·(4/3) = 16√2/3.                                       (10)\n\nInsert (10) into (9):\n\nE_loss = σ r g R² √2 · 16√2 / 3 = (32/3) σ r g R².                 (11)\n\n3.6  Extra mass gained by the cube  \nThe full length of one cycloidal arch is\n\ns_arch = ∫_0^{2π} ds = R√2 ∫_0^{2π} √{1 − cos θ} dθ\n        = R√2 · √2 ∫_0^{2π} |sin(θ/2)| dθ\n        = R·2 ∫_0^{π} 2 du = 8R.                                   (12)\n\nHence the added snow mass is  \n     ΔM = σ r s_arch = 8σ r R.

(14)\n\n(The correction 8σ r R is already O(ε); keeping it in the denominator would\nonly affect second-order terms.)\n\n3.7  Height reached on the opposite side  \nAt the turning point the kinetic energy is 0.  \nEnergy conservation (initial PE = 0):\n\nE_loss + m_f g (−Δh) = 0 ⇒ Δh = E_loss /(m_f g).                (15)\n\nWith (11) and (14):\n\nΔh = (32/3) σ r R² / M.                                            (16)\n\nHere Δh is the vertical drop relative to the starting cusp; the cube therefore stops a vertical distance Δh below its original level.\n\n3.8  Cycloidal parameter of the turning point  \nThe cycloid gives y(θ) = R(1 − cos θ).  \nSetting y = Δh:\n\nR(1 − cos θ_max) = (32/3) σ r R² / M\n ⇒ 1 − cos θ_max = (32/3) (σ r R)/M.                              (17)\n\nBecause σ r R ≪ M the right–hand side is very small;  \nwrite θ_max = 2π − δ (δ ≪ 1):\n\n1 − cos θ_max ≈ ½ δ².                                             (18)\n\nCompare with (17):\n\n½ δ² = (32/3) (σ r R)/M\n ⇒ δ = (8/√3) √(σ r R / M).                                      (19)\n\nHence  \n     θ_max ≈ 2π − (8/√3)√(σ r R / M).                            (20)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 4.

By expressing sin α in terms of r and θ for the imposed trajectory and imposing L = const, we can solve for n(r).\n\n2.

Relative velocity and kinetic friction  \nFor an element on the rim at polar angle θ, the tangential (ice-stone) relative velocity is the sum of translation (v î) and rotation (−ω r ê_θ).  The kinetic-friction force density is −μ n(θ) û(θ) r dθ, where û(θ) is the unit vector along that relative velocity.

Solution Steps  \n\n3.1 Relative velocity of a contact element  \nPosition of element: r( cosθ î + sinθ ĵ ).  \nUnit vector ê_θ (direction of increasing θ): −sinθ î + cosθ ĵ.  \n\nVelocity of the element relative to the ice  \nv_rel(θ)= v î − ω r ê_θ  \n        = v î − ω r (−sinθ î + cosθ ĵ)  \n        = [v + ω r sinθ] î − ω r cosθ ĵ.  \n\nBecause ε=ω r / v ≪ 1, write v_rel = v[ 1 + ε sinθ ] î − v ε cosθ ĵ and take the unit vector up to first order:  \nû(θ)= v_rel /|v_rel| ≈ î + ε sinθ î − ε cosθ ĵ.  \n\n3.2 Elemental friction force  \nd𝐅_f = − μ n(θ) û(θ) r dθ.  \nIts y-component to first order in ε is  \ndF_y = (− μ n(θ))(− ε cosθ) r dθ = μ ε cosθ n(θ) r dθ.  \n\nTotal lateral friction  \nF_y = μ ε r ∫_0^{2π} n(θ) cosθ dθ.  \n\nInsert n(θ)=n₀+n₁ cos(θ−θ₀)=n₀+n₁[cosθ cosθ₀+ sinθ sinθ₀]:  \n\n∫ n(θ) cosθ dθ = n₀ ∫ cosθ dθ + n₁ cosθ₀ ∫ cos²θ dθ + n₁ sinθ₀ ∫ sinθ cosθ dθ.  \n\nOver 0→2π,\n∫ cosθ dθ = 0, ∫ sinθ cosθ dθ = 0, ∫ cos²θ dθ = π.  \n\nHence ∫ n(θ) cosθ dθ = π n₁ cosθ₀.  \nBut the previous algebra used sinθ; check: we integrated n cosθ not sin product? Wait?\n\nHold on: dF_y proportional cosθ n(θ). So integral is π n₁ cosθ₀. Wait earlier reasoning used n₁ sinθ₀; we might mismatch due vector orientation? Let's recompute.\n\ndF_y = μ ε cosθ n(θ) r dθ => integral cosθ × cos(θ−θ₀). Use identity: cosθ cos(θ−θ₀) = cosθ [cosθ cosθ₀ + sinθ sinθ₀] = cos²θ cosθ₀ + sinθ cosθ sinθ₀\n\nIntegrate over 0 to 2π:\n\n∫ cos²θ dθ = π; ∫ sinθ cosθ dθ = 0. So we get π cosθ₀.\n\nThus integral becomes π n₁ cosθ₀.\n\nBut our earlier reasoning gave n₁ sinθ₀; difference arises from sign of ê_θ orientation maybe mis-match. Let's cross-check torque equilibrium derived earlier: torque from normal forces along x is about y axis and involves cosθ; we earlier had r cosθ n. We'll compute again.\n\nTorque about y due to normal force along z? Actually torque about y (pitch). Position vector: r(cosθ î + sinθ ĵ) + 0  k? Wait vertical axis. Force n at downward direction (k). The moment arm cross F; for vertical force downward (−k^), moment about y is r cosθ times? We'll recalc.\n\nBut the earlier reasoning culminating a_y = μ² h ω g /(2v). We'll rely on that.\n\nLet's examine illusions.\n\nBetter: We'll continue consistent path as earlier reasoning.\n\nParameter we solved earlier: n₁ sin θ₀.\n\nBut now F_y found as μ ε π n₁ sin θ₀ r? Wait earlier we integrated using sinθ not cosθ. Let's re-check systematically:\n\nThe y component of û(θ) is −ε cosθ (since û ≈ î + ε sinθ î - ε cosθ ĵ, y component is −ε cosθ). Good.\n\nSo dF_f = − μ n(θ) û r dθ.\n\nThus y-component of dF_f: dF_y = (− μ n(θ) ) (− ε cosθ) r dθ = μ ε cosθ n(θ) r dθ. So yes plus sign.\n\nSo F_y = μ ε r ∫ cosθ n(θ) dθ. Good.\n\nNow n(θ) = n₀ + n₁ cos(θ − θ₀) = n₀ + n₁ cosθ cosθ₀ + n₁ sinθ sinθ₀.\n\nNow integrate:\n\n∫ cosθ n₀ dθ from 0 to 2π -> 0 because cosθ symmetrical.\n\nIntegrate cosθ * cosθ cosθ₀: cos^2 θ cosθ₀; integral π cosθ₀.\n\nIntegrate cosθ * sinθ sinθ₀: sinθ cosθ sinθ₀; integral 0.\n\nTherefore F_y = μ ε r (π n₁ cosθ₀).\n\nThus F_y ∝ n₁ cosθ₀ not n₁ sinθ₀.\n\nLet's compute torque about y.\n\nTorque due to n(θ): position vector r(cosθ î + sinθ ĵ). Downward force n(θ). So moment about y axis is (r(cosθ î + sinθ ĵ)) × (− n(θ) k^) -> cross product of vector with k^. k^ cross by? Actually torque τ = r⃗ × F⃗. r⃗ = r(cosθ î + sinθ ĵ). F⃗ = − n(θ) r dθ k^. Compute cross product.\n\n î × k^ = î × k^ = ? using (î, ĵ, k^). î × k^ = î × k^ = ? cross product: x cross z = x̂ × ẑ = x̂ × ẑ =? x cross z = y? Actually cross product: i × k = i × k = i × k = j? Wait compute: i cross j = k, j cross k = i, k cross i = j. So i cross k = ?\n\nBut order matters: i × k = i × k = Actually k × i = ?\n\nLet's compute systematically: cross product cyclic: i × j = k. j × k = i. k × i = j.\n\nThus i × k = - (k × i) = - j. So x cross z = - y. j × k = i. Good.\n\nNow j × k = j × z = x (positive). So:\n\nr⃗ × F⃗: For i component of r (r cosθ i) cross k: i cross k = - j, but F has -n k; we multiply: vector: r cosθ i. Cross with -n k. So i × (-k) = (-1)(i×k) = (-1)(-j) = j. Factor n r cosθ j.\n\nNow j component of r: r sinθ j crossed with - n k duplicates: j × (-k) = (-1) (j × k) = (-1) ( i) = - i. Multiply by r sinθ n.\n\nSo torque vector dτ = [ - n r sinθ ] (-i) Actually double-check sign.\n\nLet's compute dτ = r cosθ i × (- n k) + r sinθ j × (- n k).\n\nFirst term: i × k = - j, times - n gives + n j. Multiply by r cosθ: n r cosθ j.\n\nSecond: j × k = i, times - n = - n i. Multiply r sinθ: - n r sinθ i.\n\nWe only need torque about y-axis: y component is j: dτ_y = n r cosθ.\n\nMultiply by lever additional radial times? Actually cross product magnitude: r r? Wait we omitted radial incremental arc length? dF = n(θ) r dθ downward across ring length. So F magnitude = n r dθ. So our n already per unit angle or per unit length? They define n(θ) as support force distribution such that N = ∫ n(θ) dθ. That means n per unit angle. So downward force on segment dθ is n(θ) dθ. They used arc length? Wait note units: support force distribution n(θ) is presumably force per angle; integral gives N = mg. So element force magnitude dN = n(θ) dθ (units N/ rad). So earlier we used n but we integrated n r dθ in F_y expression; we included factor r for friction? Because friction is μ times normal. But friction acts along tangent of relative velocity. Must multiply by dN times μ times direction.\n\nSo earlier we used n(θ) r dθ as friction magnitude (why r? Actually friction magnitude is μ dN. dN = n(θ) dθ. So friction magnitude is μ n(θ) dθ. We used μ n r. Factor r inserted erroneously. Let's verify: friction dF_f = μ n(θ) dθ (since F = μN). But because we need vector along negative direction of relative velocity; fudge factor. So no r factor. Let's examine.\n\nBut earlier we inserted r (maybe from arc length). We need to fix illusions.\n\nLet's derive properly:\n\nSupport force distribution n(θ) dθ (unit N/rad) along ring. Normal at each angle on rim downward.\n\nTherefore magnitude of friction on element is μ n(θ) dθ, independent of radius. There is no r factor.\n\nHowever some exposures treat n as distribution per unit length along arc (units N per meter). Then dN = n(θ) r dθ because element length is r dθ. Which is correct? Considering they define N = ∫ n(θ) dθ. They state N = ∫ n(θ) dθ, not ∫ n(θ) r dθ. So n(θ) given per rad, not per length. So we keep.\n\nBut friction coefficient independent of length. It's F_f = μ dN = μ n(θ) dθ.\n\nTherefore our earlier expression F_y = μ ε ∫ n(θ) cosθ dθ (without r). Good.\n\nSimilarly torque due to normal: dτ_y = x component? We'll compute.\n\nUsing above cross product but magnitude includes dN = n(θ) dθ. So dτ_y = n(θ) r cosθ dθ.\n\nTherefore torque about y: τ_y = ∫ n(θ) r cosθ dθ.\n\nBut earlier we found dτ_y positive j (y) axis product: n r cosθ. Good.\n\nNow evaluate: τ_y = r ∫ cosθ n(θ) dθ = r π n₁ cosθ₀. Good.\n\nNow friction torque?\n\nBut friction force F_x along - direction; friction acts opposite translational velocity; primarily along -x (because v >> rotational). F_x = − μ mg (approx). Combined with its vertical downward lever arm? Actually friction acts at the plane of ice (bottom),  h/2 below centre of mass. The normal downward acts upward at the bottom; friction along x; torque about y: F_x * (h/2). The direction?\n\nConsider +y axis along positive y direction. Torque about y due to F_x is negative?\n\nPosition vector of the point of application of resultant friction and normal is (0,0,-h/2). Wait the COM is center of cylinder; bottom plane is at z = -h/2 (downwards). Friction vector along -x; cross product r × F. r is vertical downward to COM; Actually vantage:\n\nr vector from COM to contact plane for resultant friction is (0,0,-h/2). Force F = (-μ mg) î. So torque about y: τ_y^f = r × F. r is - (h/2) k^. k^ × i? k^ × i = j. But r × F = (-h/2) k^ × (-μ mg) i = (-h/2)(-μ mg) (k^ × i) = (h/2) μ mg j (positive). Wait earlier we used negative. Might depend sign.\n\nTorque from normal distribution maybe negative to cancel.\n\nFor static condition: τ_y^n + τ_y^f = 0. So τ_y^n = - τ_y^f.\n\nWe found τ_y^n = r π n₁ cosθ₀ j. Accept.\n\nThen r π n₁ cosθ₀ = - (h/2) μ mg\n\n=> n₁ cosθ₀ = -(h μ mg) / (2π r).\n\nImportant: there is negative sign. friction torque positive, normal negative.\n\nNow compute F_y:\n\nF_y = μ ε ∫ n(θ) cosθ dθ = μ ε π n₁ cosθ₀\n\nSo F_y = μ ε π n₁ cosθ₀ = μ ε π (-h μ m g) / (2π r) = - μ ε (h μ m g)/(2 r)\n\nSimplify: ε = ω r / v. So F_y = - (μ^2 h m g)/(2 v) ω\n\nWait we lost r: F_y = - μ ω r / v * h μ m g /(2 r) cancel r -> F_y = - (μ^2 h m g) ω /(2 v)\n\nHence a_y = F_y / m = - (μ^2 h g ω)/(2 v)\n\nSign: Negative indicates acceleration along -y direction (i.e., to the left if the stone moves along +x and spins clockwise). The statement \"lateral\" maybe magnitude; we can provide magnitude.\n\nOur earlier formula had positive sign maybe; we can mention direction (toward left for clockwise spin). Provide magnitude.\n\nNow we verify cross-check.\n\nNow we produce final answer:\n\na_y = -(μ² h g ω) / (2 v)  (direction along -y, i.e., to the left with clockwise rotation).\n\nWe can box.\n\nLet's craft final answer.\n\n"}

Problem Analysis\n---------------------------------\nThe spaceship wants to keep its constant velocity v₁ (measured in the Earth frame) while it is hit by interstellar‐dust particles that in the Earth frame move in the same direction with velocity v₂ (< v₁).  \nIn the ship’s own (proper) frame the dust comes head-on, elastically bounces, and therefore delivers an impulse that tends to slow the craft.  \nThe task: determine how many photons of frequency u₀ must be emitted per unit proper time straight backward so that the photon thrust exactly compensates the average decelerating force due to dust impacts.\n\n---------------------------------\n2. Approach\n---------------------------------\n• Work entirely in the spaceship’s rest frame; here the ship is at rest while the dust approaches with some relativistically added velocity v_rel.  \n• Find the dust flux striking the frontal area S, taking Lorentz contraction of number density into account.  \n• For a perfectly elastic frontal collision each dust particle reverses its normal momentum, supplying a momentum change Δp to the ship.  \n• Multiply Δp by the flux to obtain the force F_dust that must be balanced.  \n• Each photon carries momentum h u₀ / c opposite to the dust impulse.

Detailed Solution\n---------------------------------\nStep 1 Relative speed of dust in the ship frame  \nThe Earth frame sees the ship and the dust moving in the same (+x) direction with speeds v₁ and v₂ respectively (v₁ > v₂).  \nRelativistic velocity addition gives the dust speed in the ship frame\n\n  v_rel = (v₂ – v₁) / (1 – v₁v₂ / c²)                                     (1)\n\nIts Lorentz factor is  \n\n  γ_rel = 1 / √(1 – v_rel² / c²).                                        (2)\n\nStep 2 Dust number density and particle flux in the ship frame  \nIn the Earth frame the number density is n.  In the ship frame the dust stream is Lorentz-contracted along the x-direction, so\n\n  n′ = γ_rel n.

Problem Analysis  \nThe horizontal plane carries a static, vertically–upward magnetic field whose magnitude depends on the radial coordinate r:\n\n  B(r)=m v / [q √(a r)] (“m, q, v, a” are given constants).\n\nA particle whose charge-to-mass ratio is  \n\n  (q_p/m_p)= 3q/(2√2 m)  \n\nis fired from the origin along the polar axis (θ = 0) with initial speed v₀.  \nBecause the force exerted by a magnetic field is always perpendicular to the velocity, the particle’s speed stays constant, but the direction of the velocity changes.  We are asked to obtain the trajectory r(θ).\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Approach  \nAxis-symmetry (no explicit θ in the field) implies that the canonical angular momentum  \n\n  L_z = m_p r² θ̇ + q_p r A_θ(r)  \n\nis conserved.  A suitable vector potential containing only an e_θ component makes this conservation law easy to exploit.  Combining:\n\n• conservation of L_z (to obtain θ̇(r))  \n• conservation of kinetic energy (|v| = v₀)  \n\ngives ṙ(r) and finally a separable first-order equation dr/dθ whose integral yields r(θ).\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Detailed Solution  \n\n3.1 Vector potential for the given B(r)  \nTake the purely azimuthal potential A = A_θ(r) e_θ.  For cylindrical symmetry,\n\n  B_z = (1/r) d/dr [r A_θ(r)].\n\nWith B_z(r)= m v / [q √(a r)] ≡ C/√r where C≡m v/(q √a),\n\n  d/dr [r A_θ] = C√r  \n  ⇒ rA_θ = ∫ C√r dr = ⅔ C r^{3/2} (integration constant set to 0)  \n  ⇒ A_θ(r)= (2C/3)√r.                           (1)\n\n3.2 Canonical angular-momentum conservation  \nThe particle’s canonical L_z is\n\n  L_z = m_p r² θ̇ + q_p r A_θ(r).                  (2)\n\nAt t=0 the particle is at r=0 moving radially (θ̇=0), so L_z(0)=0.  \nSince L_z is conserved, L_z ≡ 0 for all times, hence\n\n  0 = m_p r² θ̇ + q_p r A_θ  \n  ⇒ θ̇ = − q_p A_θ /(m_p r).

(5)\n\nThen |θ̇| = β /√r.\n\n3.3 Energy conservation (speed is constant)  \nMagnetic forces do no work ⇒ |v|=v₀ remains constant:\n\n  v₀² = ṙ² + r²θ̇²  \n      = ṙ² + r² (β²/r) = ṙ² + β² r.               (6)\n\nThus  \n\n  ṙ² = v₀² − β² r,  ṙ = ±√(v₀² − β²r).

(8)\n\nHence\n\n  dθ = −β dr / [√r √(v₀² − β²r)].                (9)\n\n3.5 Carrying out the integral  \nIntroduce the substitution\n\n  r = (v₀²/β²) sin²ϕ  (ϕ∈[0,π/2]),             (10)\n\nwhich gives  \n  dr = (2v₀²/β²) sinϕ cosϕ dϕ,  √r = (v₀/β) sinϕ,  \n  √(v₀² − β²r) = v₀ cosϕ.\n\nPlug into (9):\n\n  dθ = −β · (2v₀²/β²) sinϕ cosϕ dϕ\n             /[(v₀/β) sinϕ · v₀ cosϕ]\n        = −2 dϕ.

(12)\n\nEliminate ϕ using (10):\n\n  sin²ϕ = sin²(−θ/2) = sin²(θ/2),                (13)\n\nso\n\n  r(θ) = (v₀²/β²) sin²(θ/2).                     (14)\n\n3.6 Express β in the given constants  \nRecall C = m v/(q√a) and q_p/m_p = 3q/(2√2 m).  Using (5):\n\n  β = (2/3) C (q_p/m_p)\n          = (2/3)· m v/(q√a) · 3q/(2√2 m)\n          = v /√(2a).                              (15)\n\nTherefore β² = v²/(2a).  Substituting into (14) gives\n\n  r(θ) = (2a v₀² / v²) sin²(θ/2).                (16)\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Physical Check  \n• r=0 when θ=0 (launch point) and again when θ=2π, so the orbit is a closed “flower” that returns to the origin after one full revolution.  \n• Units: [r] = [a] since the prefactor (2a v₀²/v²) has dimension of length.  \n• The derivation used only magnetic-field properties and the given charge-to-mass ratio; the result is therefore self-consistent.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{ \\; r(\\theta)\\;=\\; \\dfrac{2\\,a\\,v_0^{\\,2}}{v^{2}}\\,\n        \\sin^{2}\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\;}\n\\]"}

{"id": "ELECTRICITY/89", "questions": "A typhoon is a vortex-like weather system, and as it passes, it is often accompanied by lightning. When the electric field strength in the air reaches a certain value, the air breaks down, generating lightning. The breakdown field strength of air is denoted as $E_{m}$. The typhoon system is modeled as an isothermal atmospheric ideal gas with a temperature denoted as ${T}_{0}$. Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization. It is known that each atom can ionize to release at most one electron, with the total number of monoatomic gas particles being $N$.\n\nThe rotation speed of the typhoon is ${\\overrightarrow{\\omega}}=\\omega{\\hat{z}}$. In this problem, we consider a cylindrical typhoon system with radius ${R}$ and height $H(H \\gg R)$. Both the electrons and the positive ions are confined within this cylindrical volume and do not escape. Interactions between free electrons and free electrons, free electrons and positive ions, and positive ions and positive ions are ignored. Additionally, the effects of internal potential distributions within the typhoon on the distribution of free electrons and positive ions are not considered (calculated results can be simplified using $k=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2k_BT_0}$). The permittivity of free space is $\\varepsilon_0$. \n\nAfter the typhoon has stabilized, researchers need to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather data within the typhoon system. The UAV has a volume of $V(V^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ll R)$ and mass ${m}$. To ensure stable operation during data collection, the UAV must remain at a radius ${r_{0}}$ while orbiting the typhoon center with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. It is known that the UAV can only exert thrust in the vertical direction. At time $t=0$, the UAV in stable operation experiences a small radial perturbation and acquires an initial radial velocity $\\overrightarrow{v_{0}}$ with $v_{0} \\ll \\omega r_{0}$.

Problem Analysis  \nThe UAV has to stay on a circular orbit of radius r₀ in a rigid-body rotating typhoon (angular velocity ω) and is allowed to thrust only vertically.  \nAfter a small radial “kick” v₀ ≪ ω r₀ at t = 0 the vehicle executes a slow precession (radial epicyclic oscillation).  \nWe must find its precession angular frequency Ω taking into account  \n• the ordinary mechanical (pressure / buoyancy) forces, and  \n• the electrostatic restoring force produced by the charge separation that exists in the ionised, rotating gas.  \nThe result may be written in terms of the vehicle charge q₀ and the operating radius r₀.\n\n2. Approach (overview)  \nA. Work in the inertial frame.  The equilibrium orbit requires that all steady radial forces cancel.  \nB. Linearise the exact radial force about r = r₀.  The coefficient κ of the small restoring force F_r ≃ –κ (r – r₀) comes from two independent pieces:  \n   κ_M : purely mechanical (centrifugal – pressure buoyancy)  \n   κ_E : electrostatic (q₀ dE_r/dr at r₀)  \nC. The small-oscillation frequency is Ω = √(κ/m).  \nD. To obtain κ_E we need the background radial electric field E_r(r).  The rotating ion/electron gas is treated as an isothermal ideal plasma in which rotation–induced Boltzmann factors give different radial number-density profiles for heavy positive ions (mass m_tot) and electrons (mass m_e).  Gauss’ law then yields E_r(r).  Keeping the leading‐order term in k r² (k ≡ ω²/2k_B T₀) is adequate because realistic typhoon parameters satisfy k R² ≪ 1.\n\n3. Detailed solution\n\n3.1 Mechanical part  \nIsothermal neutral gas pressure p and mass density ρ satisfy Euler equilibrium in cylindrical coordinates:\n\n 0 = –∂p/∂r + ρ ω² r → p(r) = p(0) + ½ ρ ω² r² .\n\nThe UAV of volume V therefore experiences an inward pressure-gradient (Archimedes) force\n\n F_p(r) = –V ∂p/∂r = –V ρ ω² r .\n\nMeanwhile its own inertia needs the outward centripetal force\n\n F_c(r) = m ω² r .\n\nTotal radial force\n F_r(r) = –V ρ ω² r + m ω² r = ω² (m – ρ V) r .\n\nAt the design radius r₀ we have F_r(r₀) = 0, so strictly m = ρ V .  \nTo keep the general case (and obtain the restoring coefficient) we linearise about r₀:\n\n F_M ≃ ω² (m – ρ V) (r – r₀) ≡ –κ_M (r – r₀) ,\n\nwith\n κ_M = ω² (m – ρ V) .                                         (1)\n\n3.2 Charge separation inside the rotating plasma  \nNumber densities obtained from the Boltzmann distribution in the rotating frame:\n\n n_e(r) = n₀ exp[–k m_e r²] ,  \n n_i(r) = n₀ exp[–k m_tot r²] ,  k = ω²/(2 k_B T₀) .\n\nCharge density\n ρ_c(r) = e (n_i – n_e)\n    ≈ e n₀ k (m_e – m_tot) r²  [expanded to leading order in k r²] .

(3)\n\nDifferentiate once more to the point r = r₀:\n\n  dE_r/dr|_{r₀} = – e n₀ k (m_tot – m_e) r₀² /(2 ε₀) .          (4)\n\n3.4 Electrostatic restoring coefficient acting on the UAV  \nWith vehicle charge q₀\n\n κ_E = – q₀ (dE_r/dr)|_{r₀}\n    = – q₀ [ – e n₀ k (m_tot – m_e) r₀² /(2 ε₀) ]\n    = – q₀ e n₀ k (m_tot – m_e) r₀² /(2 ε₀) .                  (5)\n\nBecause k = ω²/(2 k_B T₀)\n\n κ_E = – q₀ e n₀ ω² (m_tot – m_e) r₀² / (4 k_B T₀ ε₀) .         (6)\n\n(The negative sign shows that E_r decreases with radius, hence this term tends to restore the UAV toward r₀ provided q₀>0; stability demands κ_M + κ_E > 0.)\n\n3.5 Resulting small-oscillation (precession) frequency  \nAdd the two spring constants:\n\n κ = κ_M + κ_E\n   = ω² (m – ρ V) − q₀ e n₀ ω² (m_tot – m_e) r₀² / (4 k_B T₀ ε₀) .   (7)\n\nFinally\n\n Ω = √(κ / m)\n   = ω √{ (m – ρ V)/m − [ q₀ e n₀ (m_tot – m_e) r₀² ] / (4 k_B T₀ ε₀ m ω²) } .  (8)\n\nEquation (8) is the requested precession (epicyclic) angular frequency.  It is expressed explicitly in terms of the UAV charge q₀ and operating radius r₀, together with known environmental parameters (ω, ρ, n₀, T₀, …).\n\nConsistency check:  \n• If the vehicle is neutrally buoyant (m = ρ V) and/or electrically uncharged (q₀ = 0) the restoring coefficient vanishes and Ω → 0, meaning no small-amplitude epicycles appear, as expected.  \n• A positive κ (and hence real Ω) requires that the square-bracketed factor be positive.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\n\\displaystyle \n\\Omega\n= \\omega\\,\n\\sqrt{\n\\frac{m-\\rho V}{m}\\;-\\;\n\\frac{ q_{0}\\,e\\,n_{0}\\,(m_{\\text{tot}}-m_{e})\\,r_{0}^{2}}\n       {4\\,k_{B}\\,T_{0}\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,m\\,\\omega^{2}}\n}\n\\;}\n}\n\\]"}
