{"id": "495", "questions": "In 1845, Faraday studied the influence of electricity and magnetism on polarized light and discovered that heavy glass, originally non-optically active, exhibited optical activity under the influence of a strong magnetic field, causing the plane of polarization of polarized light to rotate. This was the first time humanity recognized the relationship between electromagnetic phenomena and light phenomena. The magneto-optical rotation effect later became known as the Faraday Effect.\n\nIn the magneto-optical rotation effect, the rotation angle of the vibration plane \\(\\beta\\) is proportional to the distance \\(d\\) that light travels through the medium and is also proportional to the magnetic induction intensity \\(B\\) within the medium, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\beta = vBd\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the proportionality constant, known as the Verdet constant, which depends on the properties of the medium and is also related to the wavelength of the incident light. Assume that the medium can be modeled using the Lorentz model, where the medium is composed of atoms, with \\(N\\) atoms per unit volume, and each atom contains \\(Z\\) electrons in the outer shell. The outer electrons deviate from their equilibrium positions and are subject to linear restoring forces: \\(\\vec{f} = -k\\vec{r}\\), with the harmonic resonance frequency of the outer shell electrons being \\(\\omega_0\\). The interaction between the incident light and the medium exclusively involves the outer shell electrons.\n\nCircularly polarized light can be regarded as the result of the synthesis of two linearly polarized light waves with the same frequency and direction, mutually perpendicular vibration axes, and a stable phase relationship. The two linearly polarized light waves have the same amplitude and a phase difference of \\(\\pm\\pi/2\\), representing left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Similarly, a linearly polarized light wave can be decomposed into left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components.\n\nBased on these models, calculate the Verdet constant \\(\\beta\\) for incident light with an angular frequency of \\(\\omega\\).

The Faraday effect arises because the two circular polarizations experience different refractive indices n± in the presence of B.\n\n2) Electron equation of motion (Lorentz model with a magnetic field)\n- Consider an outer-shell electron of charge −e, mass m, bound harmonically with natural frequency ω0. Neglect damping (no absorption).\n- The equation of motion for the displacement r in the x–y plane is:\nm r¨ + m ω0^2 r = − e E − e (r˙ × B0).\n- Work in the frequency domain with r(t) = Re{r e^{-i ω t}} and E(t) = Re{E e^{-i ω t}}. Then r˙ = − i ω r and the Lorentz force term is − e (r˙ × B0) = − e [ − i ω r × (B ẑ) ] = − e (− i ω B) (r × ẑ).\n- In the circular basis, one uses r = r+ e+ + r− e− and the identities r × ẑ = + i r+ e+ − i r− e−. Thus v × B0 = r˙ × B0 = − i ω (r × B0) = ± ω B r± e±.\n- Projecting onto each circular polarization yields:\n[m (ω0^2 − ω^2) ± e ω B] r± = − e E±,\nso\nr± = − (e/m) E± / [ (ω0^2 − ω^2) ± ω Ωc ],\nwhere Ωc ≡ e B / m is the (magnitude of the) cyclotron frequency for the electron.\n\n3) Polarization and susceptibility for the two circular modes\n- Each atom has Z identical outer electrons and there are N atoms per unit volume, so the polarization density for the ± mode is:\nP± = N Z (−e) r± = N Z e^2 E± / [ m ( (ω0^2 − ω^2) ± ω Ωc ) ].\n- In SI units, P = ε0 χ E. Therefore\nχ±(ω, B) = [ N Z e^2 ] / [ ε0 m ( (ω0^2 − ω^2) ± ω Ωc ) ].\n\n4) Refractive indices n± and first-order expansion in B\n- For μr ≈ 1 at optical frequencies, n±^2 = 1 + χ±. Define A ≡ N Z e^2 / (ε0 m) and Δ ≡ ω0^2 − ω^2. Then\nn±^2 = 1 + A / (Δ ± ω Ωc).\n- For weak fields (Ωc ≪ Δ/ω), expand to first order:\n1 / (Δ ± ω Ωc) ≈ (1/Δ) ∓ (ω Ωc)/Δ^2.\nHence\nn±^2 ≈ 1 + A/Δ ∓ A (ω Ωc)/Δ^2.\n- The zero-field refractive index n(ω) satisfies n^2(ω) = 1 + A/Δ. Therefore\nn± ≈ n ∓ [ A (ω Ωc) ] / [ 2 n Δ^2 ].\n\nThus the circular-birefringence splitting is:\nn+ − n− ≈ − [ A (ω Ωc) ] / [ n Δ^2 ].\n\n5) Rotation angle and the Verdet constant\n- A linearly polarized wave is the equal superposition of the two circular modes. As they propagate a distance d, the accumulated phase difference is\nΔφ = (ω d / c) (n+ − n−).\n- The polarization rotation is half the phase difference:\nβ = (1/2) Δφ = (ω d / 2 c) (n+ − n−).\n- Define the Verdet constant V by β = V B d. Using Ωc = e B / m,\nV(ω) = β / (B d) = (ω / 2 c) (n+ − n−)/B = − (ω / 2 c) (Ωc) (∂n/∂ω),\nafter using the identity below.\n\n6) Compact dispersion form and Becquerel formula\n- From n^2 = 1 + A/Δ one finds\n∂ n^2 / ∂ ω = 2 A ω / Δ^2, hence ∂ n / ∂ ω = (A ω) / (n Δ^2).\nComparing with n+ − n− above gives\nn+ − n− = − Ωc ∂ n / ∂ ω.\n- Therefore the Verdet constant can be written in two equivalent, widely used forms:\nV(ω) = − (e / (2 m c)) ω ∂ n / ∂ ω = (e / (2 m c)) λ ∂ n / ∂ λ,\nwhere λ = 2 π c / ω and we used ω (∂ n/∂ ω) = − λ (∂ n/∂ λ). The overall sign depends on the handedness convention and the direction of B.\n\n7) Explicit Lorentz-oscillator expression in terms of microscopic parameters\n- Substituting ∂ n / ∂ ω = (A ω)/(n Δ^2) into V(ω) gives\nV(ω) = − (e / (2 m c)) ω [ A ω / (n Δ^2) ]\n= − [ N Z e^3 / (2 ε0 m^2 c) ] [ ω^2 / ( n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2 ) ].\n- In many contexts one quotes the magnitude, and/or uses the λ-derivative form which is manifestly positive in transparent regions:\n|V(ω)| = (N Z e^3 / (2 ε0 m^2 c)) [ ω^2 / ( n (ω0^2 − ω^2)^2 ) ] = (e / (2 m c)) λ |∂ n / ∂ λ|.\n\nNotes:\n- The result assumes a transparent spectral region (no damping), so χ and n are real.\n- The sign of β for a given B and propagation direction depends on the conventions for left/right circular polarization and for positive rotation; the magnitude is determined by the formulas above.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,V(\\omega)\\equiv\\frac{\\beta}{B\\,d}\\;=\\;-\\;\\frac{e}{2 m c}\\,\\omega\\,\\frac{d n}{d\\omega}\\;=\\;\\frac{e}{2 m c}\\,\\lambda\\,\\frac{d n}{d\\lambda}\\;=\\;-\\;\\frac{N Z e^{3}}{2\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,m^{2}\\,c}\\,\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{n\\,(\\omega_{0}^{2}-\\omega^{2})^{2}}\\;,\\;\\text{(sign set by rotation convention)}\\,} \\]"}

Because the table is smooth, the contact can only exert vertical impulses/forces.\n- Immediately after the impulse, the coin must not interpenetrate the table. The only way for a rigid flat disk to begin moving upward without any point of its surface attempting to go downward into the table is for the motion to be an instantaneous rotation about the left rim line (x = −r), i.e., that line has zero vertical velocity at t = 0+, and all other points move upward. This enforces a kinematic relation between the upward CM speed v0 and the initial angular speed Ω0 about that horizontal axis:\n  v0 = Ω0 r.\n\nPost-impact rocking motion about the left rim line:\n- Let θ be the rotation angle of the disk about the left rim line (y-axis), with θ = 0 just after the impulse and θ increasing as the right side lifts. The CM is a distance r from the pivot and its height is z(θ) = r sinθ.\n- Moment of inertia of the disk about a diameter (through its center) is I_d = (1/4) m r^2. About the pivot line (left rim), by the parallel-axis theorem,\n  I_p = I_d + m r^2 = (1/4 + 1) m r^2 = (5/4) m r^2.\n- Equation of motion about the pivot (no torque about the pivot from the normal reaction) under gravity (torque −m g r cosθ):\n  I_p θ¨ = − m g r cosθ.    (1)\n- Energy is conserved during contact (frictionless, no dissipation):\n  (1/2) I_p θ̇^2 + m g r sinθ = (1/2) I_p Ω0^2.    (2)\n  Thus θ̇^2 = Ω0^2 − (2 m g r / I_p) sinθ.\n\nNormal reaction and loss-of-contact condition:\n- The vertical acceleration of the CM is z¨ = r (cosθ θ¨ − sinθ θ̇^2). Newton’s second law in the vertical direction gives for the net normal reaction N at the pivot line:\n  N − m g = m z¨ = m r (cosθ θ¨ − sinθ θ̇^2).    (3)\n- Use (1) to eliminate θ¨ and (2) to eliminate θ̇^2. First, from (1): θ¨ = −(m g r / I_p) cosθ. Substitute into (3):\n  N = m g + m r [ −(m g r / I_p) cos^2θ − sinθ θ̇^2 ].\n- Now substitute θ̇^2 from (2): θ̇^2 = Ω0^2 − (2 m g r / I_p) sinθ:\n  N = m g − m r sinθ Ω0^2 + (2 m^2 g r^2 / I_p) sin^2θ − (m^2 g r^2 / I_p) cos^2θ.\n  Grouping terms and using I_p = (5/4) m r^2 so that (m^2 g r^2 / I_p) = (4/5) m g, we get a compact form:\n  N = m [ g ( (1 + 12 sin^2θ)/5 ) − (r Ω0^2) sinθ ].    (4)\n\nThreshold (minimum) initial speed for detachment:\n- The coin loses contact when N = 0. For the minimum Ω0 (equivalently minimum CM speed v0 = Ω0 r) that allows detachment, N(θ) must just touch zero for some θ = θ∗ (first loss of contact), i.e., N = 0 and dN/dθ = 0 at θ∗.\n- From (4), let s = sinθ. Then (with Ω0 constant):\n  N/m = (g/5) (1 + 12 s^2) − (r Ω0^2) s.\n  Differentiating with respect to θ and setting to zero at θ∗:\n  d(N/m)/dθ = cosθ [ (24 g/5) s − r Ω0^2 ] = 0.\n  For detachment at an interior angle (cosθ∗ ≠ 0), we require:\n  r Ω0^2 = (24 g/5) s.    (5)\n- Combine this with N = 0:\n  (g/5) (1 + 12 s^2) − (r Ω0^2) s = 0.\n  Substitute (5):\n  (g/5)(1 + 12 s^2) − (24 g/5) s^2 = 0\n  ⇒ (g/5)(1 − 12 s^2) = 0\n  ⇒ s^2 = 1/12 ⇒ s = sinθ∗ = 1/√12.\n- Then from (5):\n  r Ω0^2 = (24 g/5) (1/√12 · 1/2) = (12 g)/(5√3) = (4/5) √3 g.\n- Therefore the minimum initial CM speed v0,min = Ω0 r satisfies:\n  v0,min^2 = r (r Ω0^2) = r ( (4/5) √3 g ) = (4 √3 / 5) g r.\n\nNumeric check:\n- The dimensionless constant is (4√3/5) ≈ 1.38564; hence v0,min ≈ 1.177 sqrt(g r). The detachment occurs early, at θ∗ with sinθ∗ = 1/√12 ≈ 0.2887 (θ∗ ≈ 16.7°).\n\nObservations:\n- The result is independent of m and the applied impulse magnitude I; I only sets the actual attained v0. If v0 ≥ v0,min, the coin will lose contact at some point in the subsequent rocking motion; if not, it will rise slightly and settle without detaching.\n- The smoothness (no friction) of the table is essential; the vertical impulse is redistributed by a vertical support impulse such that the initial motion is about the left rim line (x = −r), enforcing the non-penetration constraint.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,v_{0,\\min} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{5}\\; g r}\\,} \\]"}

Therefore, there is no impulsive transmission of velocity along the strings, and immediately after the impact we have\n- v1 = v0 (horizontal),\n- v2 = 0,\n- v3 = 0.\n\nKey kinematic constraint (length-constraint differentiated twice):\nFor any two points A and B connected by a rigid, massless string of fixed length l with unit vector e pointing from B to A,\nr = rA − rB = l e, with r ⋅ r = l^2 ⇒ d^2/dt^2 (r ⋅ r) = 0\ngives\nr ⋅ (aA − aB) + (vA − vB) ⋅ (vA − vB) = 0,\ni.e.\n(aA − aB) ⋅ e = − |vA − vB|^2 / l.\nWe apply this along the vertical (downward) direction e for each string at the instant after the strike.\n\n1) Top string (ceiling–ball 1):\nThe ceiling is fixed (v = 0, a = 0). With A = ball 1, B = ceiling, and |v1 − 0| = v0 (purely horizontal),\na1,down = − v0^2 / l.\nThus ball 1 has an upward vertical acceleration of magnitude v0^2 / l.\n\n2) Middle string (ball 1–ball 2):\nHere A = ball 1, B = ball 2. At the instant, v1 − v2 has magnitude v0 (horizontal), so\n(a1 − a2) ⋅ e = − v0^2 / l ⇒ a1,down − a2,down = − v0^2 / l.\nUsing a1,down = − v0^2 / l from step 1 gives\na2,down = 0.\n\n3) Bottom string (ball 2–ball 3):\nAt the instant, v2 = v3 = 0, so |v2 − v3| = 0 and hence\n(a2 − a3) ⋅ e = 0 ⇒ a3,down = a2,down = 0.\n\nNow apply Newton’s second law along the vertical (downward) direction for each ball.\n\n- Ball 1 (top):\nForces (downward positive): −T1 (top string upward), +T2 (middle string downward), +mg.\nEquation:\n−T1 + T2 + mg = m a1,down = − m v0^2 / l.     (1)\n\n- Ball 2 (middle):\nForces: −T2 (upward), +T3 (downward), +mg.\nEquation:\n−T2 + T3 + mg = m a2,down = 0.                 (2)\n\n- Ball 3 (bottom):\nForces: −T3 (upward), +mg (downward).\nEquation:\n−T3 + mg = m a3,down = 0 ⇒ T3 = mg.            (3)\n\nFrom (2) and (3):\n−T2 + (mg) + mg = 0 ⇒ T2 = 2 mg.\n\nThus, the instantaneous tension in the middle string, at the moment the top ball is struck, is simply the weight of the two lower balls. It is independent of v0. For completeness, one can also read off from (1) that T1 = 3 mg + m v0^2 / l, but the question only asks for T2.\n\nPhysical interpretation:\n- Immediately after the strike, the middle string has the middle ball as the instantaneous center of rotation (its end at ball 2 has zero velocity), so the centripetal acceleration needed due to v0 is entirely supplied by the top string. The middle string just supports the static weight of the two balls below at that instant.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{T_{\\text{middle}} = 2\\,m g}\n\\]"}

The torso and both arms have length l; each leg has length 1.2 l. The mass per unit length of rods is λ, so\n  - M_torso = λ l,\n  - M_arm (each) = λ l,\n  - M_leg (each) = 1.2 λ l,\n  - M_head = m = 0.6 λ l.\n- Hinges connect the parts. The arms are actively actuated by a couple at the shoulders to execute a prescribed small motion θ(t) of amplitude θ0 and frequency ω. The legs and head are passive at their hinges: no active couple can be applied there.\n- We analyze the free-fall situation in the co-falling (uniformly accelerated) frame, where gravity is effectively absent for internal dynamics (equivalence principle). Thus, in this frame, no gravitational restoring torques act; motions are governed by inertia and internal couplings only.\n- Angles:\n  - θ is the arm-torso angle (given, small oscillation about θ ≈ π/2).\n  - φ is the leg-torso angle, defined as the angle between each leg and the extended torso line (downward), near φ ≈ π/4.\n  - Let α(t) denote the absolute orientation of the torso (small oscillation).\n\nKey dynamical facts in free fall\n1) Passive hinges (no couple) imply the attached body has zero external moment at that hinge. For planar motion, taking moments about the hinge point, the absolute angular acceleration of the attached body about that hinge must vanish if no other distributed torque acts (no gravity in co-falling frame). Therefore:\n   - The head (hinged at the neck) has zero absolute angular acceleration; with zero initial angular velocity, its absolute rotation rate remains zero: ω_head(t) = 0 for all t.\n   - Similarly, each leg (hinged at the hip) has zero absolute angular acceleration; with zero initial angular velocity, its absolute rotation rate remains zero: ω_leg(t) = 0 for all t.\n\n   In particular, if the absolute leg angle is θ_leg, with θ_leg = α − φ (since φ is measured relative to the torso line), then θ̈_leg = 0 gives\n   α̈ − φ̈ = 0  ⇒  φ̈ = α̈.\n   With φ̇(0) = α̇(0) = 0, we get the kinematic relation\n   φ(t) = α(t)\n   for the subsequent motion (small-angle regime). Thus, the legs’ passive oscillation amplitude equals the torso oscillation amplitude.\n\n2) Total angular momentum conservation about any fixed point (or the system center of mass) must hold, since there is no external torque in free fall. Because the head and legs remain with zero absolute angular velocity, they do not contribute to the angular momentum. The only contributors are the torso and the two arms. The arms are driven so that their angular velocity relative to inertial space is α̇ + θ̇, while the torso rotates at α̇.\n\nWe will compute angular momentum about the torso’s midpoint O (an inertial frame point for small oscillations about the chosen origin). Linearizing about the initial configuration θ ≈ π/2, φ ≈ π/4, we can treat the relevant moments of inertia as constants evaluated at that configuration.\n\nMoments of inertia about the torso midpoint O\n- Torso (slender rod length l, mass M_torso = λ l) about its own center:\n  I_t = (1/12) M_torso l^2 = (1/12) λ l^3.\n\n- Each arm is a slender rod of length l, mass M_arm = λ l, hinged at the shoulder. At the initial configuration, the arms are perpendicular to the torso (θ = π/2), so the distance from O (torso midpoint) to the arm’s center is\n  d_arm = sqrt((l/2)^2 + (l/2)^2) = l / sqrt(2).\n  The arm’s moment of inertia about O is by the parallel-axis theorem:\n  I_arm,O = I_cm + M_arm d_arm^2 = (1/12) M_arm l^2 + M_arm (l^2/2)\n          = (1/12 + 1/2) λ l^3 = (7/12) λ l^3.\n  For two arms (symmetric), total arms inertia about O is\n  I_a = 2 I_arm,O = 2 × (7/12) λ l^3 = (7/6) λ l^3.\n\n- The head and legs are passive (no couple at their hinges), and we have established that they remain with zero absolute angular velocity (ω = 0). Thus they do not contribute to the angular momentum budget, regardless of their distances from O. This is why the head’s radius r and its mass m = 0.6 λ l, though given, drop out of the angular momentum balance.\n\nAngular momentum conservation and torso response\nLet L be the total angular momentum about O. With no external torque, L = constant. The system starts from rest, so L = 0 for all time. The torso contributes I_t α̇, and the two arms contribute I_a (α̇ + θ̇). Therefore,\nL = I_t α̇ + I_a (α̇ + θ̇) = 0.\n\nSolve for α̇ in terms of θ̇:\n(I_t + I_a) α̇ + I_a θ̇ = 0\n⇒ α̇ = − (I_a / (I_t + I_a)) θ̇.\n\nUsing I_t = (1/12) λ l^3 and I_a = (7/6) λ l^3,\nI_t + I_a = (1/12 + 7/6) λ l^3 = (1/12 + 14/12) λ l^3 = (15/12) λ l^3 = (5/4) λ l^3,\nI_a / (I_t + I_a) = (7/6) / (5/4) = (7/6) × (4/5) = 28/30 = 14/15.\n\nHence,\nα̇ = − (14/15) θ̇.\n\nIntegrating (and using α̇(0) = θ̇(0) = 0):\nα(t) = − (14/15) θ(t) + constant.\nWith initial α(0) = 0 and θ(0) specified, the integration constant is chosen so that α tracks θ with that gain. For a sinusoidal drive θ(t) = θ0 cos(ω t) (small angle),\nα(t) = − (14/15) θ0 cos(ω t).\n\nPassive legs amplitude\nAs established above, φ(t) = α(t) (from torque-free hips and initial rest), so the leg opening angle relative to the torso oscillates with the same amplitude as the torso’s absolute oscillation:\nφ(t) = − (14/15) θ0 cos(ω t).\nTherefore, the (steady-state) amplitude of the leg oscillation about φ = π/4 is\nΦ0 = (14/15) θ0.\n\nRemarks\n- The result is independent of ω in this free-fall setting because there is no restoring torque (no gravity in the co-falling frame and no leg actuation); hence there is no intrinsic leg “natural frequency” and no true resonance peak. The leg motion is kinematically slaved to the torso rotation induced by the arms via angular momentum conservation.\n- The numerical factor 14/15 arises from the ratio of the arms’ composite inertia to the total inertia of “torso + arms” about the torso midpoint O at the linearization point θ = π/2.\n- The head’s mass and radius do not affect this amplitude because the head is also torque-free at the neck and hence carries no angular momentum (ω_head ≡ 0) in the co-falling frame.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,\\Phi_0 \\;=\\; \\frac{14}{15}\\,\\theta_0\\,}\n\\]"}

Let the center of the circle be O at position (X, Y) and let the arc’s diameter (the line connecting its endpoints) make a small angle φ with the horizontal (φ = 0 at the stable, symmetric equilibrium). Then the endpoints of the arc are at\n  A_L = (X − R cosφ, Y − R sinφ), A_R = (X + R cosφ, Y + R sinφ).\n- The two strings impose the constraints\n  |U_L A_L| = |U_R A_R| = L,\n  which yield, to linear order about equilibrium (φ = 0, X = 0, Y = Y0),\n  X = −(2 Y0 R)/(2R − d) ⋅ φ, and δY = 0 at O(φ).\n  Here Y0 satisfies the equilibrium geometry\n  Y0^2 = L^2 − (d/2 − R)^2.\n\nThus, to first order, the vertical height of the arc’s center, Y, is constant; a small rotation φ induces a horizontal translation X proportional to φ.\n\nThe small ball (“bead”) of mass m is constrained to the semicircular arc and sits at the bottom for φ = 0. Let its small displacement along the arc be ψ (ψ = 0 at the bottom); then in the arc’s body frame its position relative to O is r_b,rel = (R sinψ, −R cosψ). The absolute angle of the bead about O is (φ + ψ), but we will retain φ and ψ as small generalized coordinates.\n\n2) Tensions and a key torque balance\n\nLet T_L and T_R be the tensions in the left and right strings. For small oscillations about φ = 0, the direction cosines of both strings change only at higher order; to first order, the vertical direction cosine is c_y = Y0/L, the same for both strings at the symmetric equilibrium.\n\n- Sum of vertical components gives\n  c_y (T_L + T_R) = 2 m g + 2 m a_cm,y,\n  where a_cm,y is the vertical acceleration of the total center of mass. At a turning point of small oscillations, velocities vanish and a_cm,y is at most of first order; for the rigid-body mode we will take a_cm,y ≈ 0 to leading order.\n\n- The difference of tensions is controlled by the external torque about O. Computing the torque about O from the string forces (to leading order in small angles) gives\n  τ_z,strings ≈ (Y0/L) R (T_R − T_L) = c_y R (T_R − T_L).\n  The only external gravitational torque about O is from the bead: τ_g = −m g R sinψ ≈ −m g R ψ. The time derivative of the total angular momentum about O is\n  dH_z/dt = (I_arc + m R^2) φ̈ + m R^2 ψ̈,\n  where for a thin semicircular arc (a ring segment) I_arc = m R^2 (mass elements at radius R).\n\nHence the torque balance about O gives\n  c_y R (T_R − T_L) − m g R ψ = (2 m R^2) φ̈ + m R^2 ψ̈.\n\nThus\n  T_R − T_L = (m/c_y)[ g (ψ/R) + 2 R φ̈ + R ψ̈ ].\n\n- Meanwhile, the sum S = T_L + T_R, to leading order (taking a_cm,y ≈ 0 at the turning point), is\n  S ≈ 2 m g / c_y.\n\nTherefore, at such an instant\n  T_L = (S − D)/2 = (m/c_y)( g − R φ̈ − (g ψ + R ψ̈)/2 ).\n\nThis is the key linearized expression: the instantaneous left tension depends on gravity (baseline) minus contributions from angular accelerations and the bead’s displacement/acceleration.\n\n3) Which motion maximizes the tension drop?\n\nFor small oscillations, two normal-motion ingredients are apparent:\n\n- If ψ alone oscillates on a fixed arc (φ = 0), then ψ̈ ≈ −(g/R) ψ and one finds D = 0; i.e. pure bead oscillation does not split the tensions to leading order (T_L = T_R). Thus bead motion alone cannot slack a single string in the linear regime.\n\n- The rigid-body “swing-seat” mode (ψ = 0) is effective. Then\n  T_L = (m/c_y)( g − R φ̈ ).\n  Hence T_L reaches zero if and only if\n  R φ̈ reaches g at some instant.\n\nTherefore, in order for one string to go slack during a small oscillation, the rigid-body mode must be excited sufficiently that its angular acceleration magnitude satisfies\n  |φ̈|max ≥ g/R.\n\nWe will now evaluate |φ̈|max in terms of the total energy E0 (assumed small enough for linear theory) and the geometry (L, d, R).\n\n4) Small-oscillation dynamics of the rigid-body mode\n\nSet ψ = 0. The rigid-body coordinate is φ only. Two energy contributions are needed:\n\n- Potential energy U(φ) to quadratic order:\n  The bead, located at distance R below O, rises by Δy_b ≈ (R/2) φ^2, giving U_b ≈ (1/2) m g R φ^2.\n  The semicircular arc’s center of mass lies at a distance |y_c| = 2R/π below O for the “lower” semicircle; rotating the arc by φ raises its COM by Δy_arc ≈ (|y_c|/2) φ^2, giving U_arc ≈ (1/2) m g |y_c| φ^2 = (m g R / π) φ^2.\n  Thus total U ≈ (1/2) k φ^2 with\n  k = m g R c0, where c0 = 1/2 + 1/π.\n\n- Kinetic energy T(φ̇):\n  (i) The arc rotates about O with I_arc = m R^2, and the bead contributes m R^2 as well, total rotational inertia about O: 2 m R^2.\n  (ii) In addition, the center O translates horizontally with X = −α φ, where from the constraints\n      α = 2 Y0 R / (2R − d), with Y0 = sqrt( L^2 − (d/2 − R)^2 ).\n      The resulting translational kinetic energy is (1/2)(2m) (Ẋ)^2 = m α^2 φ̇^2.\n  Therefore total kinetic energy is\n      T = (1/2) M_eff φ̇^2, with M_eff = 2 m (R^2 + (α^2)/2)? Careful bookkeeping gives\n      T = 1/2 (m R^2) φ̇^2 (bead) + 1/2 (m R^2) φ̇^2 (arc) + m α^2 φ̇^2 (translation)\n        = m R^2 φ̇^2 + m α^2 φ̇^2\n        = (1/2) [2 m (R^2 + α^2)] φ̇^2,\n      so M_eff = 2 m (R^2 + α^2).\n\nThus the rigid-body small oscillation is simple harmonic with\n  ω_φ^2 = k / M_eff = [m g R c0] / [2 m (R^2 + α^2)]\n         = g R c0 / [2 (R^2 + α^2)].\n\n5) Maximal angular acceleration for given energy E0\n\nIf the total small-oscillation energy E0 is placed entirely in this mode, then at the turning point (where |φ| = φ_max, φ̇ = 0) the energy is all potential:\n  E0 = (1/2) k φ_max^2 ⇒ φ_max = sqrt(2 E0 / k).\n\nAt that instant, the angular acceleration magnitude is maximal:\n  |φ̈|max = ω_φ^2 φ_max = (k/M_eff) sqrt(2 E0 / k)\n           = (sqrt(k) / M_eff) sqrt(2 E0).\n\nThe “slackening condition” T_L = 0 requires R |φ̈|max ≥ g, i.e.\n  (R / M_eff) sqrt(k) sqrt(2 E0) ≥ g.\n\nSubstituting k = m g R c0 and M_eff = 2 m (R^2 + α^2):\n  (R / [2 m (R^2 + α^2)]) sqrt(m g R c0) sqrt(2 E0) ≥ g.\n\nRearrange:\n  2 m (R^2 + α^2) ≤ (R / g) sqrt(2 m g R c0 E0).\n\nSquare both sides:\n  4 m^2 (R^2 + α^2)^2 ≤ (R^2 / g^2) (2 m g R c0 E0).\n\nCancel one factor of m:\n  4 m (R^2 + α^2)^2 ≤ (2 R^3 c0 E0)/g.\n\nNow express α in terms of d:\n  α = 2 Y0 R / (2R − d), Y0^2 = L^2 − (d/2 − R)^2.\n  Then\n  R^2 + α^2 = R^2 [ 1 + 4 Y0^2/(2R − d)^2 ]\n            = 4 R^2 L^2 / (d − 2R)^2,\n  where we used Y0^2 = L^2 − ( (d − 2R)^2 / 4 ), so 1 + 4 Y0^2/(2R − d)^2 = 4 L^2/(d − 2R)^2.\n\nTherefore\n  (R^2 + α^2)^2 = 16 R^4 L^4 / (d − 2R)^4.\n\nPlugging in:\n  4 m ⋅ [16 R^4 L^4 / (d − 2R)^4 ] ≤ (2 R^3 c0 E0)/g.\n\nSolve for |d − 2R|:\n  64 m R^4 L^4 / (d − 2R)^4 ≤ (2 R^3 c0 E0)/g\n  ⇒ (d − 2R)^4 ≥ (64 m R^4 L^4 g) / (2 R^3 c0 E0)\n                = (32 m g R L^4) / (c0 E0).\n\nThus the necessary and sufficient condition (in this linearized, all-energy-in-rigid-mode sense) for the existence of an instant with T_L = 0 is\n  |d − 2R| ≥ [ (32 m g R L^4) / (c0 E0) ]^{1/4},\n  where c0 = 1/2 + 1/π.\n\nSince we are asked for the maximum d that still allows one string to slacken, we take the largest d consistent with this inequality and the geometric feasibility of the strings:\n  −L ≤ d/2 − R ≤ L ⇒ 2(R − L) ≤ d ≤ 2(R + L).\n\nHence, the “d-window” allowed by slackening is outside a neighborhood of 2R of half-width δ = [(32 m g R L^4)/(c0 E0)]^{1/4}. The largest permissible d is the upper endpoint:\n  d_max = min{ 2(R + L), 2R + [(32 m g R L^4)/(c0 E0)]^{1/4} }.\n\nIn the practically relevant regime where the small-oscillation energy E0 is not so enormous as to push d_max beyond the geometric limit, the value is\n  d_max = 2R + [ (32 m g R L^4) / (c0 E0) ]^{1/4},\n  with c0 = 1/2 + 1/π.\n\nRemarks:\n- The key physical content is that (i) only the rigid-body swing-like mode splits the two tensions at linear order, and (ii) to drive one tension to zero needs the seat’s angular acceleration to reach g/R. Given total energy E0, that sets a bound on the generalized inertia M_eff (hence on α and d). The result shows that if the two supports are too nearly above the arc endpoints (d too close to 2R), the inertial penalty (large α) prevents sufficient angular acceleration; moving the supports far enough away (in either direction from 2R) reduces α and makes slackening possible.\n\n- The analysis is consistent to linear order in φ, ψ, and presumes the system’s small oscillation energy is concentrated in the rigid mode at the instant when T_L reaches its minimum. Including bead motion can only modestly adjust constants but does not change the form of the bound.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ d_{\\max} \\;=\\; 2R \\;+\\; \\min\\!\\left\\{\\,2L,\\;\\left[\\dfrac{32\\,m g\\,R\\,L^{4}}{\\,\\Big(\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{\\pi}\\Big)\\,E_{0}\\,}\\right]^{\\!1/4}\\right\\} } \\]"}

For the homogeneous-medium solution, the electric field at y=0 is purely tangential (no normal component): En(y=0)=0. Therefore, imposing an interface at y=0 with different (σ, ε) above and below does not alter the potential distribution, because the interface conditions (continuity of V and of normal (σ+sε)En) are automatically satisfied with En=0.

{"id": "409", "questions": "In electromagnetism, we often study the problem of electromagnetic field distribution in a region without charge or current distribution. In such cases, the electromagnetic field will become a tubular field. The so-called tubular field is named because of the nature of the velocity field of an incompressible fluid at every instant. Its characteristic can be described using the language of vector analysis as the field's divergence being equal to zero. Another perspective is that if we take the field lines of a vector field $\\pmb{F}$ (the tangent line at each point being the direction of field strength) and select a flux tube along a set of field lines passing through a certain cross-section, then at any cross-section of the flux tube, the field flux:\n\n$$\n\\int F\\cdot\\mathrm{d}S=\\Phi\n$$  \n\nwill be a conserved quantity. This problem will investigate a special case of a tubular field that is rotationally symmetric around the $z$ axis: using oblate spheroidal coordinates to construct a unique tubular field as an electric field or magnetic field. The so-called oblate spheroidal coordinate system is similar to spherical coordinates, and it is generated by the following coordinate transformations:\n\n$$\nx= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\cos \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\ny= a \\mathrm{ch}\\mu \\cos \\nu \\sin \\varphi\n$$  \n\n$$\nz=a\\mathrm{sh}\\mu\\sin\\nu\n$$  \n\nWe want the shape of the field lines of an electric field or magnetic field to precisely follow its generatrix direction, i.e., the tangent direction of the curve where field strength changes with $\\mu$ while $\\nu,\\varphi$ remain fixed (upwards when $\\relax z>0$). \n\nFind the charge distribution in the $xy$ plane that can produce this electric field distribution. Assume the field strength near the origin is $E_0$. The dielectric constant is $\\varepsilon_{0}$.", "solutions": "First, we determine the equation of the constant-$\\mu$ line. Now, using the trigonometric identity $\\sin^{2}\\nu+\\cos^{2}\\nu=1$, we eliminate the parameter $\\nu$:\n\n$$\n{\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}{\\mathrm{ch}}^{2}\\mu}}+{\\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2}{\\mathrm{sh}}^{2}\\mu}}=1\n$$\n\nIts physical significance is that, for an electric field, it forms a surface of equal potential. This is based on the fact that equipotential surfaces should always be perpendicular to the electric field lines. The constant-$\\mu$ lines, being ellipses, satisfy this condition: their tangent directions are aligned with the external bisectors of angles formed by lines connecting the two foci, and they are perpendicular to the tangent directions of the hyperbolic electric field lines, which correspond to the internal bisectors.\n\nNext, we determine an inverse transformation. For a point in the first quadrant with coordinates $(x, z)$, the distances to the two foci are:\n\n$$\nr_{+}=\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+z^{2}}\\quad,\\quad r_{-}=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus, the semi-major axis lengths of the ellipse and hyperbola are respectively:\n\n$$\nr_{+}+r_{-}=2a\\mathrm{ch}\\mu\n$$\n\n$$\nr_{+}-r_{-}=2a\\cos\\nu\n$$\n\nThese two equations help convert Cartesian coordinates into generalized coordinates $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.

This difference is equal to the electric field strength multiplied by the displacement length. Because the ellipses represent equipotential surfaces, this product is constant everywhere. In particular, taking $\\nu=90^{\\circ}$ places this point exactly on the $z$-axis, and the electric field strength at this location has already been computed in (2). We obtain the following equation:\n\n$$\n{\\frac{E_{0}a^{2}}{a^{2}+a^{2}\\mathrm{{sh}}^{2}\\mu\\sin^{2}{90^{\\circ}}}}\\cdot a\\mathrm{{ch}}\\mu\\mathrm{{d}}\\mu=E\\cdot a{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{{ch}}^{2}\\mu-\\cos^{2}\\nu}}\\mathrm{{d}}\\mu\n$$\n\nThis gives the distribution of electric field strength.

We will realize it as an electric field E = −∇V produced by a surface charge σ(x, y) confined to the plane z = 0. The magnitude near the origin is prescribed to be E0, and the permittivity is ε0.\n\n1) Geometry and scale factors of the oblate spheroidal system\n\nThe coordinates (μ, ν, φ) are defined by\nx = a cosh μ cos ν cos φ\ny = a cosh μ cos ν sin φ\nz = a sinh μ sin ν\n\nOne convenient range is μ ≥ 0, ν ∈ [−π/2, π/2], φ ∈ [0, 2π). The coordinate surfaces μ = const are oblate spheroids, and the coordinate lines with ν, φ fixed (and μ varying) are their generators; we want E to be tangent to these.\n\nThe metric scale factors (in an orthogonal curvilinear system) are:\nh_μ = a sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)\nh_ν = a sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)\nh_φ = a cosh μ cos ν\n\nThus, the unit vector along increasing μ is e_μ = (1/h_μ) ∂r/∂μ. Its z-component is\ne_μ · ẑ = (1/h_μ) ∂z/∂μ = (a cosh μ sin ν)/(a sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)) = cosh μ sin ν / sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν).\n\nIn particular, on the plane z = 0 inside the focal disk (ρ = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < a), which corresponds to μ = 0 and ρ = a cos ν with 0 ≤ ν ≤ π/2, we have\nh_μ(μ=0) = a sin ν, and e_μ · ẑ|_{μ=0} = sin ν / sin ν = +1 for ν > 0 (upper half-space), while for ν < 0 (lower half-space) it equals −1.\n\n2) A curl-free tubular field E along e_μ\n\nA static electric field must be curl-free; thus take E = −∇V with V depending only on μ so that E is purely along e_μ:\nE = −(1/h_μ) dV/dμ e_μ.\n\nAway from sources, V must be harmonic: ∇^2 V = 0. In orthogonal coordinates,\n∇^2 V = 1/(h_μ h_ν h_φ) ∂/∂μ [ (h_ν h_φ / h_μ) dV/dμ ].\n\nUsing h_ν = h_μ and h_φ = a cosh μ cos ν, we get\n∇^2 V = 1/(h_μ^2 h_φ) ∂/∂μ [ h_φ dV/dμ ]\n= 1/[a^2 (sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν) (a cosh μ cos ν)] ∂/∂μ [ a cos ν cosh μ dV/dμ ].\n\nThe factor cos ν cancels, leaving\n∇^2 V = [sinh μ (dV/dμ) + cosh μ (d^2V/dμ^2)] / [a^2 cosh μ (sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)].\n\nTherefore ∇^2 V = 0 for all (μ, ν) if and only if\ncosh μ V''(μ) + sinh μ V'(μ) = 0.\n\nLet W(μ) = V'(μ). Then\nW'/W = −tanh μ  ⇒  W(μ) = C1 / cosh μ.\n\nIntegrating,\nV(μ) = C1 ∫ dμ / cosh μ + C0 = C1 arcsin(tanh μ) + C0,\n\nsince d/dμ [arcsin(tanh μ)] = sech μ = 1/cosh μ.\n\nHence the field is\nE = −(1/h_μ) V'(μ) e_μ = −(1/h_μ) (C1 / cosh μ) e_μ\n= −C1 / [a cosh μ sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)] e_μ.\n\nThis field is everywhere divergence-free and curl-free for z ≠ 0, and its lines follow μ-lines by construction.\n\n3) Fixing the constant from the on-axis field E0\n\nAlong the symmetry axis (ρ = 0), we have ν = π/2 and z = a sinh μ; then h_μ = a cosh μ. On the axis, e_μ is parallel to +ẑ for z > 0, and\nE_z(ρ = 0, z > 0) = −C1 / (a cosh^2 μ).\n\nNear the origin (μ → 0), cosh μ → 1, so E_z → −C1/a. The problem states the field strength near the origin is E0 and points upward for z > 0, so we choose C1 = −a E0. Thus,\nV(μ) = −a E0 arcsin(tanh μ) + const,\nE(μ, ν) = E0 / [cosh μ sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)] e_μ.\n\nFor later use, note the “tube flux” through any cross-section normal to e_μ, namely h_ν h_φ E_μ = a cosh μ cos ν · a sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν) · E_μ, is independent of μ:\nh_ν h_φ E_μ = a cos ν (−C1) = a^2 E0 cos ν,\nconfirming the tubular property.\n\n4) Boundary condition at the plane and the surface charge on z = 0\n\nThe only source is a surface charge σ(x, y) on the plane z = 0. Maxwell’s boundary condition for the normal component is\nσ(ρ) = ε0 [E_z(0^+) − E_z(0^−)].\n\nWe now evaluate E_z just above and below the plane.\n\nInside the focal disk (ρ < a), the plane z = 0 is reached at μ = 0 with ρ = a cos ν, 0 ≤ ν ≤ π/2 (upper side corresponds to ν > 0, lower to ν < 0). Using E = E_μ e_μ with E_μ = E0 / [cosh μ sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)], we have at μ = 0:\nE_μ(μ = 0, ν) = E0 / sin ν = E0 / sqrt(1 − (ρ/a)^2).\n\nFrom the expression for e_μ · ẑ at μ = 0 found above, we get\nE_z(0^+, ρ < a) = +E_μ(0, ν) = E0 / sqrt(1 − (ρ/a)^2),\nE_z(0^−, ρ < a) = −E_μ(0, ν) = −E0 / sqrt(1 − (ρ/a)^2).\n\nTherefore the jump is\nΔE_z(ρ < a) = E_z(0^+) − E_z(0^−) = 2 E0 / sqrt(1 − (ρ/a)^2).\n\nOutside the disk (ρ > a), the plane is reached at ν = 0 with μ > 0, and sin ν = 0, so e_μ is tangent to the plane at the crossing and E_z tends to zero continuously from above and below; hence there is no surface charge there.\n\nThus the surface charge density on the plane is supported on the circular disk of radius a and is given by\nσ(ρ) = ε0 ΔE_z = 2 ε0 E0 / sqrt(1 − (ρ/a)^2), for ρ < a,\nσ(ρ) = 0, for ρ ≥ a.\n\nThis σ produces exactly the tubular, axisymmetric electric field described above, with field lines along μ and magnitude E0 near the origin. The edge behavior σ ∼ (a − ρ)^{−1/2} at ρ → a− is the standard integrable edge singularity. The total charge on the disk is finite:\nQ = ∫_0^a 2πρ σ(ρ) dρ = 4π ε0 E0 a^2.\n\nFor completeness, the potential can be written compactly as\nV(μ) = −a E0 arcsin(tanh μ) + const,\nand in oblate coordinates the field is\nE(μ, ν) = E0 / [cosh μ sqrt(sinh^2 μ + sin^2 ν)] e_μ,\npointing upward for z > 0.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe required charge distribution is a circular disk of radius a in the plane z = 0 with surface charge density (in cylindrical radius ρ = √(x^2 + y^2))\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\sigma(\\rho) = \\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{2\\,\\varepsilon_0\\,E_0}{\\sqrt{\\,1 - (\\rho/a)^2\\,}}, & 0 \\le \\rho < a,\\\\[6pt]\n0, & \\rho \\ge a,\n\\end{cases} } \\]\nwhich generates the electrostatic field whose lines coincide with the μ-coordinate lines of the oblate spheroidal system, with magnitude E0 near the origin and pointing upward for z > 0."}

Gravity acts downward with magnitude g.\n\n1) Geometry and equilibrium\n- At the equilibrium configuration (the elliptical cylinder at the bottom, with its minor axis vertical), the contact occurs at the lower endpoint of the minor axis. At that point, the line from C to the contact point P passes through C and has length b. The center C is thus at a distance s0 = R − b from O along the vertical.\n- Let φ be the small angular displacement of the center C around O from the bottom (downward vertical). Then the center’s height increases by Δh = (R − b)(1 − cos φ) ≈ (R − b) φ^2/2 for small φ.\n\n2) No-slip (rolling) kinematics near the bottom\n- Rolling without slipping against a fixed surface means the instantaneous velocity of the contact point P relative to the container is zero. Therefore, the rigid body undergoes an instantaneous pure rotation about P.\n- For any rigid body in instantaneous rotation about P, the center’s speed is v_C = ω r_CP, where ω is the angular speed about the out-of-plane axis and r_CP is the distance from C to the contact point P.\n- Near the bottom contact of the ellipse, r_CP = b at leading order; its variation with φ is second order because the bottom of the ellipse is an extremal point. Hence, to linear order, v_C = ω b.\n- The center C moves along a circle of radius s0 = R − b about O, so v_C = s0 φ̇. Therefore, to linear order,\n  ω = v_C / b = (R − b) φ̇ / b.\n\n3) Energies\n- Rotational inertia about the cylinder axis (perpendicular to the cross-section) for a homogeneous solid elliptical cylinder is\n  I_C = (1/4) m (a^2 + b^2).\n  This reduces to I_C = (1/2) m r^2 for a = b = r (solid circular cylinder), as expected.\n- Translational kinetic energy of C:\n  T_trans = (1/2) m v_C^2 = (1/2) m (R − b)^2 φ̇^2.\n- Rotational kinetic energy about C:\n  T_rot = (1/2) I_C ω^2 = (1/2) I_C [(R − b)^2 / b^2] φ̇^2.\n- Total kinetic energy:\n  T = (1/2) (R − b)^2 [ m + I_C / b^2 ] φ̇^2.\n\n- Gravitational potential energy (relative to equilibrium):\n  U = m g Δh ≈ (1/2) m g (R − b) φ^2.\n\n4) Linearized equation of motion and angular frequency\n- The Lagrangian L = T − U gives the linear equation\n  (R − b)^2 [ m + I_C / b^2 ] φ̈ + m g (R − b) φ = 0.\n- Hence the small-oscillation angular frequency ω_n is\n  ω_n^2 = [ m g (R − b) ] / [ (R − b)^2 ( m + I_C / b^2 ) ]\n         = g / [ (R − b) ( 1 + I_C / (m b^2) ) ].\n\n- Substituting I_C = (1/4) m (a^2 + b^2),\n  1 + I_C/(m b^2) = 1 + (a^2 + b^2)/(4 b^2) = (5 b^2 + a^2)/(4 b^2).\n\nThus\n  ω_n = sqrt[ g / (R − b) ] / sqrt[ 1 + (a^2 + b^2)/(4 b^2) ]\n      = sqrt[ 4 b^2 g / ( (R − b) (a^2 + 5 b^2) ) ].\n\nThe (ordinary) frequency is f = ω_n / (2π).\n\nChecks:\n- If a = b = r (solid circular cylinder), this reduces to\n  ω_n^2 = (2 g) / [3 (R − r)], in agreement with the standard result for a solid disk rolling inside a fixed circle.\n- The mass M of the fixed thin circular cylinder does not enter because the container is fixed (no kinetic energy of the container).\n\nTherefore, the frequency of small oscillations of the elliptical cylinder’s center of mass is as below.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ f \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{(R-b)\\left(1+\\dfrac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{4b^{2}}\\right)}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{4b^{2}g}{(R-b)\\bigl(a^{2}+5b^{2}\\bigr)}} } \\]"}

Collisions are instantaneous, smooth (no friction), and perfectly plastic along the normal (coefficient of restitution e = 0). Gravity acts between collisions; impulsive forces act only at impact.\n\nGeometry of impact:\n- Let θ be the tilt angle from vertical (θ = 0 is upright, increasing in the forward direction).\n- The i-th rod (striker) hits the (i+1)-th rod (target) when the tip of the i-th rod reaches the vertical line through the (i+1)-th base. This occurs at the contact angle θc given by\n  sin θc = l/h ⇒ θc = arcsin(l/h).\n- At impact, the striker’s tip has height a = h cos θc = √(h^2 − l^2) above its own base; this is also the height of the contact point on the next (still-upright) rod.\n\nMoment of inertia about the base:\n- For a slender rod about an end: I = (1/3) m h^2.\n\nCollision laws (impulse-momentum and plasticity constraint):\n- Let ω1^- be the angular velocity of the striker just before impact; let ω1^+ and ω2^+ be the angular velocities of the striker and target just after impact, respectively. We take positive angular velocity as counterclockwise; in reality the motion is clockwise, so actual values are negative, but we will work with algebraic signs consistently and finally report magnitudes.\n- Let J be the horizontal contact impulse magnitude (normal to the surfaces, along the line joining the contact points, i.e., horizontal).\n- Angular impulse-momentum for each rod about its own hinge during the (short) collision (gravity negligible, hinge impulses do not contribute to moment about the hinge):\n  I ω1^+ = I ω1^- + a J,\n  I ω2^+ = 0 − a J.\n  The signs follow because the contact force on rod 1 is to the left at height a (producing a counterclockwise torque aJ), while on rod 2 it is to the right at height a (producing a clockwise torque −aJ).\n- Plastic normal constraint (e = 0) enforces zero relative normal speed at the contact immediately after collision. The horizontal velocity of a point at height y on a rod rotating with angular speed ω is vx = −ω y (with our sign convention). Evaluated at the common contact height y = a for both rods, the post-impact condition v1x' = v2x' gives\n  −ω1^+ a = −ω2^+ a ⇒ ω1^+ = ω2^+.\n- Solving the three equations:\n  From I ω2^+ = −a J and ω2^+ = ω1^+, we get a J = −I ω1^+.\n  Substitute into I ω1^+ = I ω1^- + a J:\n  I ω1^+ = I ω1^- − I ω1^+ ⇒ 2 I ω1^+ = I ω1^- ⇒ ω1^+ = (1/2) ω1^-.\nThus, at a perfectly plastic, smooth impact between identical rods at the same contact height a, the striker’s angular speed is halved, and the target emerges with the same post-impact angular speed:\n  ω2^+ = ω1^+ = (1/2) ω1^-.\n\nFree fall between impacts:\n- After being struck, a rod starts from θ = 0 with post-impact angular speed u (we denote u ≡ ω^+ at θ = 0), and rotates freely under gravity until it reaches θ = θc to hit the next rod, at which point its pre-impact speed is v (we denote v ≡ ω^- at θ = θc).\n- Energy conservation between collisions (no dissipation between impacts):\n  (1/2) I v^2 = (1/2) I u^2 + ΔU,\n  where ΔU is the gravitational potential energy drop of the rod’s center of mass from θ = 0 to θ = θc:\n  ΔU = m g (h/2) (1 − cos θc).\n  Using I = (1/3) m h^2, we obtain\n  v^2 = u^2 + (3 g / h) (1 − cos θc).\n\nIterative map and steady-state:\n- Denote by un the post-impact angular speed of the n-th rod (at θ = 0 just after being hit), and by vn its pre-impact angular speed at θ = θc just before hitting the (n+1)-th rod.\n- Between impacts: vn^2 = un^2 + (3 g / h)(1 − cos θc).\n- At impact: un+1 = (1/2) vn ⇒ un+1^2 = (1/4) vn^2.\n- Combine to get the recursion for un:\n  un+1^2 = (1/4) un^2 + (1/4) (3 g / h)(1 − cos θc).\n- This linear recursion converges to a fixed point u∞ satisfying\n  u∞^2 = (1/4) u∞^2 + (1/4) (3 g / h)(1 − cos θc)\n  ⇒ (3/4) u∞^2 = (1/4) (3 g / h)(1 − cos θc)\n  ⇒ u∞^2 = (g / h) (1 − cos θc).\n\nExpressing θc in terms of l and h:\n- θc = arcsin(l/h) ⇒ cos θc = √(1 − (l/h)^2).\n- Therefore the asymptotic post-collision angular speed (magnitude) is\n  ω∞ = u∞ = sqrt( (g / h) [1 − √(1 − (l/h)^2)] ).\n\nUseful small-spacing approximation (l ≪ h):\n- For small l/h, √(1 − (l/h)^2) ≈ 1 − (1/2)(l/h)^2, so\n  1 − √(1 − (l/h)^2) ≈ (1/2)(l/h)^2,\n  hence\n  ω∞ ≈ (l/h) sqrt(g / (2 h)).\n\nConsistency checks:\n- If l → 0 (dominoes touching), θc → 0, 1 − cos θc → 0, so ω∞ → 0: no gravitational energy is released between impacts, hence no sustained motion.\n- In steady state, the pre-impact angular speed approaches v∞ = 2 ω∞, consistent with the collision rule ω^+ = (1/2) ω^-.\n\nThus the asymptotic post-collision angular velocity is completely determined by h, l, and g as above.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\\omega_{\\infty} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{h}\\,\\Bigl(1-\\sqrt{1-\\bigl(\\tfrac{l}{h}\\bigr)^2}\\Bigr)}\\;}\\,\n\\]"}

Differentiate dU/dθ = -k q Q r^{-2} dr/dθ:\n  d^2U/dθ^2 = -k q Q [ -2 r^{-3} (dr/dθ)^2 + r^{-2} d^2r/dθ^2 ].\n  At θ = 0, dr/dθ = 0, so\n  U''(0) = -k q Q r^{-2}(0) r''(0).\n- To find r''(0), use r^2 = f(θ) = a^2 cos^2 θ + b^2 sin^2 θ.\n  Then r r' = f'/2 and r'^2 + r r'' = f''/2.\n  At θ = 0: r(0) = a and r'(0) = 0, so a r''(0) = f''(0)/2.\n  Compute f''(θ) explicitly:\n    d(cos^2 θ)/dθ = -2 cos θ sin θ, d^2(cos^2 θ)/dθ^2 = 2 sin^2 θ - 2 cos^2 θ,\n    d(sin^2 θ)/dθ =  2 sin θ cos θ, d^2(sin^2 θ)/dθ^2 = 2 cos^2 θ - 2 sin^2 θ.\n  Hence f''(0) = a^2(-2) + b^2(2) = 2(b^2 - a^2).\n  Therefore r''(0) = [f''(0)/2]/a = (b^2 - a^2)/a.\n- Plugging into U''(0):\n  U''(0) = -k q Q (1/a^2) [(b^2 - a^2)/a] = k q Q (a^2 - b^2)/a^3.\n\nThus the potential near θ = 0 is U(θ) ≈ U(0) + (1/2) U''(0) θ^2 with U''(0) = k q Q (a^2 - b^2)/a^3.\n\n5) Linearized dynamics and frequency\n- Near θ = 0, the kinetic energy is T_kin ≈ (1/2) m g(0) θ̇^2 with g(0) = a^2 sin^2 0 + b^2 cos^2 0 = b^2. So the effective inertia in θ is m b^2.\n- The linearized equation of motion is\n  m b^2 θ̈ + U''(0) θ = 0.\n- Therefore\n  ω^2 = U''(0) / (m b^2) = [k q Q (a^2 - b^2)/a^3] / (m b^2)\n      = (1/(4π ε0)) (q Q) (a^2 - b^2) / (m b^2 a^3).\n\n6) Period of small oscillations\n- T = 2π / ω = 2π sqrt(1/ω^2) gives\n  T = 2π sqrt( 4π ε0 m b^2 a^3 / [ q Q (a^2 - b^2) ] ).\n\nChecks:\n- As b → a (circle), a^2 − b^2 → 0, hence ω → 0 and T → ∞, consistent: the distance to the origin is constant on a circle, so no restoring force.\n- Dimensions: qQ/(4π ε0 a^2) has force units; inserting yields ω^2 with 1/s^2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ T \\;=\\; 2\\pi \\,\\sqrt{\\dfrac{4\\pi\\,\\epsilon_0\\, m\\, b^{2}\\, a^{3}}{\\,q\\,Q\\,\\left(a^{2}-b^{2}\\right)}} } \\]"}

For a dipole μ = μ ẑ at height h above the plane, the image is μ′ = −μ at z = −h. This choice enforces Bn = 0 at the superconducting surface (required because B = 0 inside and n·B is continuous).\n\n- Electrostatics: A superconductor is also a perfect conductor electrostatically. A static charge distribution above it induces charges equivalent to an image charge. For a spherically symmetric charge distribution of total charge Q centered a distance h above the plane, the exact image is a charge −Q located at z = −h (plus a uniform surface charge to maintain neutrality, which does not contribute to the force). The electric force is therefore the same as the Coulomb force between Q at z = +h and −Q at z = −h, provided h > R (no overlap).\n\n3) Forces and equilibrium height\n\n- Magnetic repulsion (upward): The force on the real dipole due to the image dipole is that between two collinear dipoles separated by 2h with opposite moments.

The standard thin-film (Fabry–Perot) result for the total amplitude reflection coefficient of a single film between equal outer media is\nr_tot = (r + r e^{2 i ϕ})/(1 + r^2 e^{2 i ϕ}) = r (1 − e^{2 i ϕ})/(1 − r^2 e^{2 i ϕ}),\nwhere the single-pass (through-thickness) phase in the film is\nϕ = k1 d cos i1 = (2π/λ1) d cos i1, and λ1 = λ0/n1. Since λ is the wavelength in medium 2 (λ = λ0/n2), we have λ1 = λ/n and hence\nϕ = (2π n/λ) d cos i1.\n\nThe s-polarized intensity reflectance is R_s = |r_tot|^2. There are two regimes:\n\n1) Subcritical incidence (propagating in the film): sin i2 ≤ n\n- cos i1 = √(1 − (sin i2/n)^2) is real,\n- r is real, and we obtain the well-known Airy form\nR_s = 4 R sin^2 ϕ / [ (1 − R)^2 + 4 R sin^2 ϕ ],\nwith\nR = r^2 = [ (cos i2 − n cos i1)/(cos i2 + n cos i1) ]^2,\nϕ = (2π n d/λ) √(1 − (sin i2/n)^2).\n\nThis formula shows the usual thin-film interference fringes.\n\n2) Supercritical incidence (total internal reflection at a single n2→n1 interface): sin i2 > n\nHere, cos i1 is purely imaginary. Let\nκ = √( (sin i2/n)^2 − 1 ) = (1/n) √(sin^2 i2 − n^2), so cos i1 = i κ.\nThen the single-pass “phase” ϕ is imaginary:\nϕ = (2π n d/λ) cos i1 = i α, with α = (2π n d/λ) κ = (2π d/λ) √(sin^2 i2 − n^2).\nHence e^{2 i ϕ} = e^{-2 α} ≡ q, with 0 < q < 1. The single-interface |r| = 1 (TIR) but has a phase shift; the two-interface system allows evanescent coupling (frustrated TIR), so the net reflectance is less than 1 for finite d.\n\nUsing r_tot = r (1 − q)/(1 − r^2 q) and |r|=1, one gets\nR_s = (1 − q)^2 / [1 + q^2 − 2 q cos(2θ)],\nwhere θ = arg r. For s-polarization under TIR, one can show\ncos(2θ) = 1 − 8 cos^2 i2 (sin^2 i2 − n^2)/(1 − n^2)^2.\nTherefore, with q = e^{-4π d/λ √(sin^2 i2 − n^2)}, a compact closed form is\nR_s = (1 − q)^2 / [ (1 − q)^2 + 16 q cos^2 i2 (sin^2 i2 − n^2)/(1 − n^2)^2 ].\n\nConsistency checks:\n- d → ∞ ⇒ q → 0 ⇒ R_s → 1 (no coupling across a thick low-index layer).\n- d → 0 ⇒ q → 1 ⇒ R_s → 0 (the structure reduces to uniform n2, no reflection).\n- i2 → 90° ⇒ cos i2 → 0 ⇒ R_s → 1 (grazing incidence).\n- At the critical angle sin i2 → n ⇒ α → 0, q → 1 ⇒ R_s → 0 (perfect “resonant” transmission).\n\nSummary of needed ingredients (expressed only via λ, d, i2, n):\n- Subcritical (sin i2 ≤ n): cos i1 = √(1 − (sin i2/n)^2); then\nr = (cos i2 − n cos i1)/(cos i2 + n cos i1), ϕ = (2π n d/λ) cos i1,\nR_s = 4 r^2 sin^2 ϕ / [ (1 − r^2)^2 + 4 r^2 sin^2 ϕ ].\n- Supercritical (sin i2 > n): define\nβ = 4π d/λ √(sin^2 i2 − n^2), q = e^{-β},\nthen\nR_s = (1 − q)^2 / [ (1 − q)^2 + 16 q cos^2 i2 (sin^2 i2 − n^2)/(1 − n^2)^2 ].\n\nBoth regimes are unified by r_tot = r (1 − e^{2 i ϕ})/(1 − r^2 e^{2 i ϕ}), with r and ϕ above and cos i1 continued to i κ for supercritical incidence.\n\n### Final Answer\nLet n = n1/n2 < 1 and let λ be the wavelength in n2.

We now prove this rigorously using the Maxwell stress tensor in the dielectric.\n\nMethod: Maxwell stress tensor in a linear dielectric\n- In an electrostatic, nonmagnetic, linear dielectric, the Maxwell stress tensor is\n  Tij = ε (Ei Ej) − (1/2) ε E^2 δij,\n  where ε = ε0 εr and E is the electric field in the dielectric.\n- The net force on any object enclosed by a closed surface S lying in the dielectric is\n  F = ∮S T · n dA,\n  where n is the outward unit normal from the surface into the dielectric.\n\nChoose S as a large sphere of radius a centered at the conducting sphere (with a ≫ R). On this surface, the field is the superposition of:\n- The uniform background field E0 (imposed at infinity).\n- The field due to the net free charge Q carried by the sphere, which at large r is spherically symmetric:\n  EQ(r) = (1 / (4π ε)) (Q / r^2) r̂.\n- Additional multipoles (e.g., dipole) induced by the presence of E0 and the conductor. These decay like 1/r^3 or faster and will not contribute to the surface integral in the limit a → ∞ (see below).\n\nThus at large r:\nE(r) = E0 + EQ(r) + O(1/r^3).\n\nCompute the force from T to first nonvanishing order\nWe expand the tensor quadratic in E:\nT = ε [ (E0 + EQ)(E0 + EQ) − (1/2) |E0 + EQ|^2 I ].\nWe integrate term by term over the sphere S of radius a and then take a → ∞.\n\n- The E0E0 term:\n  ∮ [ ε (E0 E0 − (1/2)E0^2 I) ] · n dA = ε (E0 E0 − (1/2)E0^2 I) : ∮ n dA = 0,\n  because ∮ n dA = 0 over any closed surface.\n\n- The EQEQ term:\n  By spherical symmetry of EQ on the large sphere, T(EQ) is isotropic on that sphere up to a scalar pressure p(r) multiplying n. Its surface integral is proportional to ∮ p n dA = 0. Hence it gives no net force.\n\n- The cross term 2 E0 EQ is the only contributor:\n  F = ε ∮ [ E0 (EQ·n) + EQ (E0·n) − (E0·EQ) n ] dA.\n  On the sphere, n = r̂ and EQ = (Q / (4π ε r^2)) n, so:\n    EQ·n = Q / (4π ε r^2),\n    E0·n = E0 cosθ,\n    E0·EQ = (Q / (4π ε r^2)) (E0·n).\n  Therefore the second and third terms cancel pointwise:\n    EQ (E0·n) − (E0·EQ) n = (Q / (4π ε r^2)) (E0·n) n − (Q / (4π ε r^2)) (E0·n) n = 0.\n  The only surviving contribution is:\n    F = ε ∮ E0 (EQ·n) dA\n      = ε E0 ∮ (Q / (4π ε r^2)) dA\n      = ε E0 (Q / (4π ε r^2)) (4π r^2)\n      = Q E0.\n\n- The O(1/r^3) induced multipoles:\n  Cross terms between E0 and any induced dipole field (∼1/r^3) scale in the integral as ∮ (E0 × 1/r^3) dA ∼ E0 (1/r^3) r^2 ∼ E0 / r → 0 as a → ∞. Quadratic terms in the multipole fields decay even faster. Hence they do not contribute to F.\n\nConclusion from the Maxwell stress tensor:\n- The total force on the body enclosed by S (the conductor plus the interfacial polarization charge sheet—i.e., “regarded as a whole” as required) is\n  F = Q E0,\n  directed along E0 for Q > 0 and opposite for Q < 0.\n- The result is independent of the radius R and the dielectric constant εr. The dielectric modifies the self-field and induces a dipole, but those do not affect the net translational force in a uniform field.\n\nAlternative viewpoint (energy method)\n- If the external field is uniform and unaffected by small displacements of the charged object (valid in an infinite medium with sources at infinity), the interaction energy of the net charge with the external potential φext = −E0·r is U = Q φext = −Q E0·r. The force is F = −∇U = Q E0, consistent with the stress-tensor result.\n\nSanity checks\n- Q = 0: F = 0 (only torque from induced dipole in uniform field).\n- εr arbitrary: F unchanged, as derived.\n- Direction: along E0 for positive Q.\n\nHence the magnitude is simply |F| = |Q| |E0|.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\\boxed{F = |Q|\\,E_{0}}\\]"}

Let B = B z-hat be uniform and constant, and let the perpendicular electric field be static but nonuniform in y:\nE(x,y,z) = E0 cos(k y) x-hat.\n\nIn a strong, uniform magnetic field, a charged particle executes rapid Larmor gyration with frequency ω_c = |q| B / m and gyroradius ρ = v_⊥ / ω_c, about a slowly moving guiding center R = (X,Y,Z). To leading order in the small parameter E0 (weak field), the gyromotion is taken to be that of the unperturbed circular orbit in the uniform B, and the slow guiding-center motion across B is given by the E×B drift based on the gyro-averaged electric field:\nv_gc⊥ = ⟨E_⊥(R + ρ_vec)⟩ × B / B^2.\n\nHere ρ_vec is the instantaneous gyroradius vector and ⟨·⟩ denotes an average over one cyclotron period.

{"id": "716", "questions": "The principle of a rotational speed measurement and control device is as follows. At point O, there is a positive charge with an electric quantity of Q. A lightweight, smooth-walled insulating thin tube can rotate around a vertical axis through point O in the horizontal plane. At a distance L from point O inside the tube, there is a photoelectric trigger control switch A. A lightweight insulating spring with a free length of L/4 is fixed at the O end, and the other end of the spring is connected to a small ball with mass m and positive charge q.  Initially, the system is in static equilibrium. The thin tube rotates about a fixed axis under the action of an external torque, allowing the small ball to move within the thin tube. When the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube gradually increases, the small ball reaches point A in the thin tube and just achieves radial equilibrium relative to the thin tube, triggering the control switch. The external torque instantaneously becomes zero, thus limiting excessive rotational speed; at the same time, the charge at point O becomes an equal amount of negative charge -Q. By measuring the position B of the radial equilibrium point of the small ball relative to the thin tube thereafter, the rotational speed can be determined. If the distance OB is measured to be $L/2$, determine the rotational speed $\\omega$ of the thin tube when the ball is at point B.

We assume no external forces, so total energy-momentum is conserved.\n\n1) Four-momentum bookkeeping\n\n- Mirror (initial): P0 = (E0/c, p0) = (γ0 m c, γ0 m v0), with γ0 = 1/√(1 − β0^2).\n- Light (initial): Kin = (Ein/c, pin) = (E/c, +E/c) (since for a photon p = E/c and it moves in +x).\n- Light (final, after reflection): Kout = (Er/c, pr) = (Er/c, −Er/c) (reflection reverses direction).\n- Mirror (final): P1 = (E1/c, p1) = (γ1 m c, γ1 m v1), with γ1 = 1/√(1 − β1^2).\n\nEnergy-momentum conservation gives:\n- Energy: γ0 m c^2 + E = γ1 m c^2 + Er\n- Momentum: γ0 m v0 + E/c = γ1 m v1 − Er/c\n\n2) Light-cone (null) combinations\n\nIt is very convenient to form the combinations (energy/c) ± momentum. Define, for any 4-momentum (E/c, p),\n- P+ ≡ E/c + p\n- P− ≡ E/c − p\n\nFor the mirror:\n- P±(mirror) = γ m c ± γ m v = γ m (c ± v) = γ m c (1 ± β)\n\nFor the light:\n- Incoming: K+ = E/c + E/c = 2E/c, K− = E/c − E/c = 0\n- Outgoing: K+ = Er/c + (−Er/c) = 0, K− = Er/c − (−Er/c) = 2Er/c\n\nConservation of total P+ and P− gives two scalar equations:\n- P1+ = P0+ + 2E/c\n- P1− + 2Er/c = P0−\n\nThat is,\nγ1 m c (1 + β1) = γ0 m c (1 + β0) + 2E/c\nγ1 m c (1 − β1) + 2Er/c = γ0 m c (1 − β0)\n\nThe first of these is all we need to get β1 in closed form without tracking the time history of the acceleration.\n\n3) Solve for β1 in closed form\n\nDivide the first light-cone equation by m c:\nγ1 (1 + β1) = γ0 (1 + β0) + 2E/(m c^2)\n\nIntroduce the rapidity η via β = tanh η, γ = cosh η, which implies the identity\nγ (1 + β) = e^{η}\nThus we have\ne^{η1} = e^{η0} + 2E/(m c^2)\n\nSince β = tanh η, we can express β1 in terms of X ≡ e^{η1} as\nβ1 = tanh η1 = (e^{2η1} − 1)/(e^{2η1} + 1) = (X^2 − 1)/(X^2 + 1)\n\nFinally, e^{η0} = γ0 (1 + β0) = sqrt[(1 + β0)/(1 − β0)]. Therefore, with\nX = γ0 (1 + β0) + 2E/(m c^2)\nwe obtain\nβ1 = ( [γ0 (1 + β0) + 2E/(m c^2)]^2 − 1 ) / ( [γ0 (1 + β0) + 2E/(m c^2)]^2 + 1 )\n\nEquivalently, directly in terms of β0,\nβ1 = ( [ sqrt((1 + β0)/(1 − β0)) + 2E/(m c^2) ]^2 − 1 ) / ( [ sqrt((1 + β0)/(1 − β0)) + 2E/(m c^2) ]^2 + 1 )\n\n4) Checks and comments\n\n- Small E limit (E ≪ m c^2): For β0 = 0, γ0 = 1 and the above gives β1 ≈ 2E/(m c^2), i.e., p_mirror ≈ m v1 ≈ 2E/c, the familiar nonrelativistic result for a perfectly reflecting mirror.\n- Large E limit: β1 → 1 as E/(m c^2) → ∞, as expected.\n- The area S0 and the irradiation time enter only through the total energy E absorbed and reflected by the mirror; the final velocity depends only on E, m, and β0 for an ideal mirror.\n\nOptional: The energy of the reflected light can be read off from the second light-cone equation:\nEr = (m c^2/2) [ γ0 (1 − β0) − γ1 (1 − β1) ] = (m c^2/2) [ e^{−η0} − e^{−η1} ]\nwith e^{η1} given above. This is less than E, the difference being the increase in the mirror’s kinetic energy.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,\\beta_{1} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\Big[\\gamma_{0}(1+\\beta_{0})+\\dfrac{2E}{m c^{2}}\\Big]^{2}-1}{\\Big[\\gamma_{0}(1+\\beta_{0})+\\dfrac{2E}{m c^{2}}\\Big]^{2}+1}\\,=\\,\\frac{\\left[\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1+\\beta_{0}}{1-\\beta_{0}}}+\\dfrac{2E}{m c^{2}}\\right]^{2}-1}{\\left[\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1+\\beta_{0}}{1-\\beta_{0}}}+\\dfrac{2E}{m c^{2}}\\right]^{2}+1}\\,}\n\\]"}

A light inextensible string of total length 2a is tied to the two vertices of one long side (the “top” side in the frame’s own coordinates), and passes over a frictionless nail. The nail exerts only forces through the string; there is no other contact.\n\n1) Geometry and notation\n- Let u be the unit vector along the frame’s long side, and v the unit vector perpendicular to u within the plane of the frame, chosen so that {u, v} is a right-handed pair. Let the angle between the long side and the horizontal be α, so\n  u = (cos α, sin α), v = (−sin α, cos α).\n- The two vertices where the string is attached (the two endpoints of that long side) have position vectors relative to the CM:\n  r± = d v ± c u,\n  where r+ corresponds to the “right” corner along +u and r− to the “left” corner along −u.\n- Let the nail be at position N relative to the CM, and resolve N in the (u, v) basis as\n  N = (d + s) v + t u,\n  where s is the offset from the midpoint of the attached side along v (perpendicular to the long side), and t is the offset along u (parallel to the long side). Thus the vectors from each corner to the nail are\n  w± = N − r± = s v + (t ∓ c) u.\n- Define the lengths of the two legs of the string:\n  ℓ± = |w±| = sqrt[s^2 + (t ∓ c)^2].\n  The inextensible string constraint is\n  ℓ+ + ℓ− = 2a.                                           (1)\n\n2) Forces and torques\n- The string is massless and the nail is frictionless, so the tension has the same magnitude T on both legs. Thus the forces exerted on the frame at the two corners are T w± / ℓ±.\n- The weight is mg acting at the CM, vertically downward (direction e_y).\n\nEquilibrium requires:\n- Force balance: T(w+/ℓ+ + w−/ℓ−) = mg e_y.\n- Torque balance: sum of torques about any point must vanish.\n\nWrite\nA = 1/ℓ+, B = 1/ℓ−, and S1 = (t − c)A + (t + c)B, S0 = A + B.\nThen\nw+/ℓ+ + w−/ℓ− = s S0 v + S1 u.\n\nProjecting the force balance along u and v yields:\n- Along u: T S1 = mg sin α.                                (2)\n- Along v: T s S0 = mg cos α.                              (3)\n\nTaking torques about the CM (out-of-plane scalar τz), one finds (a straightforward 2D cross-product calculation):\nτz = T [ c s (A − B) − d S1 ] = 0  ⇒  c s (A − B) = d S1.    (4)\n\nIt is also very convenient to take torques about the nail N. The two string forces pass through N and hence produce zero torque about N. Therefore the torque of the weight about N must vanish; that means the line of action of mg (vertical through the CM) passes through N. Equivalently, the vector from CM to nail must have zero horizontal moment relative to the vertical, which gives the simple geometric relation\nt cos α − (d + s) sin α = 0  ⇒  tan α = t/(d + s).           (5)\n\n3) Eliminating unknowns to obtain tan α\nFrom (2) and (3) we get\ntan α = (mg sin α)/(mg cos α) = [T S1]/[T s S0] = S1/(s S0).   (6)\n\nUsing (4) to eliminate S1 gives\ntan α = [c s (A − B)]/[d s (A + B)] = (c/d) [(A − B)/(A + B)]. (7)\n\nBut\n(A − B)/(A + B) = (1/ℓ+ − 1/ℓ−)/(1/ℓ+ + 1/ℓ−) = (ℓ− − ℓ+)/(ℓ− + ℓ+) = (ℓ− − ℓ+)/(2a),\nso\ntan α = (c/(2 a d)) (ℓ− − ℓ+).                               (8)\n\nUsing the identity (ℓ− − ℓ+)(ℓ− + ℓ+) = ℓ−^2 − ℓ+^2 and (1), we get\nℓ− − ℓ+ = [ℓ−^2 − ℓ+^2]/(ℓ− + ℓ+) = [(s^2 + (t + c)^2) − (s^2 + (t − c)^2)]/(2a) = (4 c t)/(2a) = (2 c t)/a. Hence\ntan α = (c/(2 a d)) · (2 c t/a) = (c^2 t)/(a^2 d).            (9)\n\nCombining (9) with the torque-about-nail relation (5), tan α = t/(d + s), gives\nt/(d + s) = (c^2 t)/(a^2 d).\nAssuming t ≠ 0 (the nontrivial tilt case), this implies\nd + s = (a^2 d)/c^2, so\ns = d (a^2/c^2 − 1) = d (a^2 − c^2)/c^2.                    (10)\n\n4) Determining t^2 from the length constraint\nWith ℓ± = sqrt[s^2 + (t ∓ c)^2] and ℓ+ + ℓ− = 2a, squaring and simplifying gives a standard relation:\nc^2 t^2 = a^2 (s^2 + t^2 + c^2) − a^4.\nThis rearranges to\nt^2 = a^2 (a^2 − c^2 − s^2)/(a^2 − c^2).                    (11)\n\nInsert s^2 from (10): s^2 = d^2 (a^2 − c^2)^2 / c^4. Then\na^2 − c^2 − s^2 = (a^2 − c^2) [1 − d^2 (a^2 − c^2)/c^4].\nThus\nt^2 = a^2 [1 − d^2 (a^2 − c^2)/c^4] \n    = (a^2/c^4) [c^4 − d^2(a^2 − c^2)]\n    = (a^2/c^4) [c^4 + c^2 d^2 − a^2 d^2].                 (12)\n\nFor a real solution we must have c^4 + c^2 d^2 − a^2 d^2 > 0, i.e.\nc^4 > a^2 d^2 − c^2 d^2,\nwhich is precisely the condition given in the statement.\n\n5) Final expression for α\nUsing (5) with d + s = a^2 d / c^2 and t = √(12), we get\ntan α = t/(d + s) = (c^2 t)/(a^2 d) \n      = (1/(a d)) sqrt[c^4 + c^2 d^2 − a^2 d^2].\n\nTherefore\nα = arctan( sqrt(c^4 + c^2 d^2 − a^2 d^2) / (a d) ).\n\nNotes:\n- The angle α is independent of m and g.\n- The condition c^4 > a^2 d^2 − c^2 d^2 ensures the radicand is positive, so α ∈ (0, π/2). The boundary case c^4 = a^2 d^2 − c^2 d^2 would give α = 0 (level long side).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{ \\displaystyle \\alpha \\;=\\; \\arctan\\!\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\,c^{4}+c^{2}d^{2}-a^{2}d^{2}\\,}}{a\\,d}\\right) }\n\\]"}

the final (electrostatic) steady state.\n\nKey physical picture:\n- Immediately after the step (t = 0+), charges have not yet moved, so the boundary behaves as a pure dielectric interface. The internal field equals the well-known static field inside a dielectric sphere in a uniform field.\n- For t > 0, conduction current inside the sphere drives a redistribution of free charge that cancels the internal field in the long-time limit (the sphere becomes equipotential because σ > 0 and there is no external circuit). This is the Maxwell–Wagner relaxation.\n- The internal field decays exponentially with a time constant τ = (ε + 2 ε0)/σ, while outside the field approaches that of a perfect conductor.\n- Joule heating occurs only inside the sphere: P(t) = ∫sphere σ |E|^2 dV.

In fact, the loose skin and longer fur of dogs provide a biological rationale for this behavior. However, this might drive you crazy when you are giving the dog a bath!\n\nTo address this, consider the following kinematics problem: treat the puppy as a sphere with radius $R$ in a uniform gravitational field with gravity $g$. The center of the sphere is suspended at a height $H>R$ above the ground. Establish a Cartesian coordinate system where the $z$-axis is vertical, the ground is at $z=0$, and the sphere's center is located at $(0,0,H)$.

Consider a droplet of water being flung off the surface of the sphere, and then follows a trajectory under the influence of gravity.\n\nIf the angular velocity is too small, water droplets cannot be flung off the top, so there's a minimum angular velocity $\\omega_{1}$.\n\nWhen the angular velocity $\\omega>\\omega_{1}$, there is still a region on the sphere where droplets cannot be normally flung off.

Since x̂ × (X, Y, Z) = (0, −Z, Y), we have v0 = (0, −ω Z, ω Y).\n\nBecause gravity and v0 have no x-component, the subsequent motion of the drop stays in the plane x = X. Define ρ = sqrt(R^2 − X^2). In that plane, the circle formed by the sphere has radius ρ and is centered at (y, z) = (0, H). We can parametrize the surface point in that plane by angle φ as\n- Y = ρ cosφ,\n- Z = ρ sinφ.\n\nThe post-detachment trajectory (neglecting air resistance) is\n- y(t) = Y − ω Z t = ρ cosφ − ω ρ sinφ t,\n- z(t) = H + Z + ω Y t − (1/2) g t^2 = H + ρ sinφ + ω ρ cosφ t − (1/2) g t^2.\n\nDistance from the center of the sphere in that plane is s(t) = sqrt( y(t)^2 + (z(t) − H)^2 ).

Solve as follows.\n\nFrom (2): s_y = (tanφ)(s_z − 1).\n\nInsert into (1):\ncosφ (s_z − 1) + sinφ [tanφ (s_z − 1)] = m λ / d\n⇒ [ cosφ + (sin^2φ / cosφ) ] (s_z − 1) = m λ / d\n⇒ (1 / cosφ) (s_z − 1) = m λ / d\n⇒ s_z − 1 = (m λ / d) cosφ.\n\nThen from s_y = tanφ (s_z − 1):\ns_y = (m λ / d) sinφ.\n\nRemarks on signs and allowed orders: Because s_z ≤ 1, we require s_z − 1 ≤ 0, which for 0 < φ < 90° implies m ≤ 0. Thus, near forward direction, only nonpositive orders appear (on one side). This does not affect the spacing magnitude we seek.\n\nProjection to the wall and spacing Δy\nA ray in direction s intersects the wall at z = L at parameter t = L/s_z, so its y-coordinate is\ny_m = t s_y = L (s_y / s_z) = L [ (m λ / d) sinφ ] / [ 1 + (m λ / d) cosφ ].\n\nNear the zeroth order (m ≈ 0), expand to first order in (m λ / d):\ny_m ≈ L (m λ / d) sinφ [ 1 − (m λ / d) cosφ + … ].\n\nHence the spacing between adjacent primary maxima near m = 0 is the derivative dy_m/dm at m = 0:\nΔy = (dy_m/dm)|_{m=0} ≈ L (λ / d) sinφ.\n\nConsistency checks:\n- φ = 90° → sinφ = 1, Δy = L λ / d (the standard normal-incidence grating formula).\n- φ = 0° → sinφ = 0, Δy = 0 (no transverse diffraction when the periodicity is along z).\n\nTherefore, with the ruler horizontal (ξ = 0), the spacing of the primary maxima near the zeroth order on the wall is\nΔy = (L λ / d) sinφ.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\Delta y \\;=\\; \\dfrac{L\\,\\lambda}{d}\\,\\sin\\phi } \\]"}
{"id": "498", "questions": "The interference phenomenon in variable refractive index systems is a new issue of concern in the field of optics in recent years.

The total charge is nQ > 0, and the potential at large distances is dominated by the monopole term, with the leading finite-size correction coming from the quadrupole term. Small radial oscillations around a circular orbit in a central potential are governed by the epicyclic frequency κ; in a strict 1/r potential, κ = Ω (the angular/orbital frequency), but multipole corrections generally make κ ≠ Ω.\n\n1) Geometry and symmetry; multipole expansion (axisymmetric part)\n\n- The n rings are “meridians”: great circles of radius R centered at the origin, each lying in a plane that contains the z-axis. The planes are equally spaced by an angle Δ = π/n around the z-axis. The charge on each ring is uniformly distributed along its circumference (2πR), with total charge Q per ring, so line density λ = Q/(2πR). Total charge of the configuration is nQ.\n\n- For r ≫ R, we expand the potential in spherical harmonics. Because the configuration is invariant under reflection z → −z, there is no dipole (l = 1) contribution. The sum over meridian planes has discrete rotational symmetry; however, for our purposes the m = 0 (axisymmetric) multipoles dominate at the lowest l, and the first nonzero terms are l = 0 (monopole) and l = 2 (quadrupole). Non-axisymmetric harmonics appear with m multiples of n and start at l ≥ n, hence their contribution on the equatorial circle is suppressed by (R/r)^{n+1} compared with the l = 2 axisymmetric term for n ≥ 3. We will keep the axisymmetric terms to O(R^2/r^3).\n\n- We may compute the axisymmetric multipole moments by first determining the φ-averaged surface charge density on the sphere r = R implied by the ensemble of meridians. Consider the “φ-average” of n identical meridians (at φ = φk = kπ/n, k = 0,…,n−1). In a small surface patch at colatitude θ, φ ∈ [φ,φ+dφ], θ ∈ [θ,θ+dθ], the number of meridian lines crossing that patch is (n/π) dφ, each contributing line charge λ times a length element R dθ. Thus the effective axisymmetric surface charge density is\n  σ_avg(θ) = [ (n/π) dφ × (R dθ) × λ ] / [ R^2 sinθ dθ dφ ]\n            = n Q / (2 π^2 R^2 sinθ).\n  This is the m = 0 component of the actual discrete distribution (the m = 0 multipoles computed with this σ_avg coincide with those of the discrete sum).\n\n- For an axisymmetric surface charge σ(θ) on r = R, the external potential can be written as\n  Φ(r,θ) = (1/(4π ε0)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ [ M_l P_l(cosθ) / r^{l+1} ],\n  with multipole moments\n  M_l = 2π R^{l+2} ∫_0^π σ(θ) P_l(cosθ) sinθ dθ.\n\n  With σ_avg(θ) above,\n  M_l = 2π R^{l+2} ∫_0^π [ nQ / (2 π^2 R^2 sinθ) ] P_l(cosθ) sinθ dθ\n      = (nQ/π) R^l ∫_0^π P_l(cosθ) dθ.\n\n  We need l = 0 and l = 2:\n  - I_0 ≡ ∫_0^π P_0(cosθ) dθ = ∫_0^π 1 dθ = π. Hence M_0 = (nQ/π) R^0 × π = nQ.\n  - I_2 ≡ ∫_0^π P_2(cosθ) dθ. Since P_2(cosθ) = (3 cos^2θ − 1)/2,\n    I_2 = (3/2) ∫_0^π cos^2θ dθ − (1/2) ∫_0^π dθ = (3/2)(π/2) − (1/2)π = π/4.\n    Hence M_2 = (nQ/π) R^2 × (π/4) = nQ R^2 / 4.\n\n- Therefore, on the equatorial plane (θ = π/2, so P_2(0) = −1/2), the scalar potential due to the rings at radius r is\n  Φ_eq(r) = (1/(4π ε0)) [ M_0 / r + M_2 P_2(0) / r^3 + O(R^4/r^5) ]\n           = (1/(4π ε0)) [ nQ / r − (nQ R^2)/(8 r^3) + O(R^4/r^5) ].\n\n2) Potential energy of −q and effective potential for radial motion\n\n- The test charge is −q (< 0), so its potential energy is U(r) = −q Φ_eq(r).

Using the above expansions,\n  Tφ ≈ (2π/Ω0) [ 1 + (3/16)(R^2/r0^2) ],\n  Tr ≈ (2π/Ω0) [ 1 − (3/16)(R^2/r0^2) ],\n  where\n  Ω0 = sqrt[ (1/(4π ε0)) (n Q q)/(m r0^3) ] and T0 ≡ 2π/Ω0 = 2π sqrt[ (4π ε0) m r0^3 /(n Q q) ].\n\n- Therefore, the difference (radial period minus angular period) to leading order in (R/r0)^2 is\n  ΔT ≡ Tr − Tφ ≈ − (3/8) (R^2/r0^2) T0\n  = − (3/8) (R^2/r0^2) × 2π sqrt[ (4π ε0) m r0^3 /(n Q q) ]\n  = − (3π R^2 / (4 r0^2)) sqrt[ (4π ε0) m r0^3 /(n Q q) ].\n\n- Equivalently, the frequency difference at leading order is\n  κ − Ω ≈ (3/8) (R^2/r0^2) Ω0 = (3 R^2 / (8 r0^2)) sqrt[ (1/(4π ε0)) (n Q q)/(m r0^3) ].\n\nRemarks\n\n- The result is valid to leading order in (R/r0)^2 and for small radial oscillations. Non-axisymmetric harmonics of the discrete set of meridians occur first at m = n (thus l ≥ n) and are suppressed by (R/r0)^{n+1} for n ≥ 3 relative to the quadrupole correction retained here; they do not affect the leading O((R/r0)^2) difference between Tr and Tφ. For n = 2, an m = 2 harmonic appears already at l = 2 and could introduce azimuthal modulation at the same order, but the axisymmetric average still captures the leading secular shift of the periods.\n\n- Note the fractional offset is set solely by (R/r0)^2; the absolute time difference scales like n^{−1/2} via T0 ∝ 1/√n.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,\\Delta T \\equiv T_{r} - T_{\\phi} \\simeq -\\,\\frac{3\\pi R^{2}}{4 r_{0}^{2}}\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\,m\\,r_{0}^{3}}{n\\,Q\\,q}}\\,,\\quad \\text{for } r_{0}\\gg R\\,} \\]"}

Try to solve for the amplitude of the oscillation angle $\\theta$ of A when $AB=x$.\n", "solutions": "# Refined Solution\n### Problem Statement Explanation\nThis problem describes a mechanical system composed of two objects, A and D, each of mass $m$. They are connected by a single light, inextensible rope that runs over two smooth, fixed pulleys, B and C. The pulleys are positioned at the same horizontal level. Object A hangs from pulley B and can swing like a pendulum, while object D hangs from pulley C, acting as a counterweight.\n\nThe variables and constants are defined as follows:\n*   $m$: The mass of object A and object D.\n*   $g$: The acceleration due to gravity.\n*   $x(t)$: The length of the rope segment AB, which acts as the length of the pendulum. This is a dynamic variable.\n*   $\\theta(t)$: The angle of the pendulum segment AB with respect to the vertical. This is a dynamic variable.\n*   $x_0$: The initial length of the pendulum, i.e., $x(0) = x_0$.\n*   $\\theta_0$: The initial angle of the pendulum, which is small.\n*   $L$: The initial length of the rope segment CD. It is stated to be sufficiently large to ensure object D does not interfere with pulley C.\n*   $\\Theta(x)$: The amplitude of the angular oscillation, which depends on the pendulum length $x$.\n\nThe system is subject to the following initial conditions at time $t=0$:\n*   The system is released from rest.\n*   The initial angle is $\\theta(0) = \\theta_0$. Since the system starts from rest, this is the initial amplitude of oscillation.\n*   The initial angular velocity is $\\dot{\\theta}(0) = 0$.\n*   The initial radial velocity is $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$.\n\nKey assumptions for the model are:\n1.  The pulleys B and C are smooth (frictionless) and their size is negligible (point-like).\n2.  The rope is massless and inextensible. Its total length is constant.\n3.  The initial angle $\\theta_0$ is small, and the angle $\\theta(t)$ remains small throughout the motion. This allows for approximations such as $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1 - \\theta^2/2$.\n4.  The problem states that 'A descends very slowly'. This is interpreted as an adiabatic process: the characteristic time scale for the change in the pendulum length $x$ is much larger than the period of the pendulum\\'s angular oscillation.

The minus sign just fixes the rotation sense (for q > 0 and B along +z one has clockwise rotation in the usual φ increasing convention).\n\n3) Linearize for small radial oscillations\n\nLet\nr(t) = r0 + ξ(t), with |ξ| ≪ r0,\nφ̇(t) = Ω0 + δΩ(t), with |δΩ| ≪ |Ω0|.\n\nAlso expand the magnetic field to first order:\nB(r) = B0 ( 1 + n ξ / r0 ) + O(ξ^2).\n\nNow linearize the equations.\n\n- Radial equation:\n\nLeft-hand side:\nr̈ − r φ̇^2 ≈ ξ̈ − (r0 + ξ)(Ω0 + δΩ)^2\n≈ ξ̈ − [ r0 Ω0^2 + 2 r0 Ω0 δΩ + ξ Ω0^2 ].\n\nRight-hand side:\nq B(r) r φ̇ ≈ q [ B0 (1 + n ξ / r0) ] [ (r0 + ξ)(Ω0 + δΩ) ]\n≈ q B0 [ r0 Ω0 + r0 δΩ + ξ Ω0 + n ξ Ω0 ].\n\nSubtract the zeroth-order balance m(− r0 Ω0^2) = q B0 r0 Ω0 to isolate linear terms. The linearized radial equation becomes:\nm [ ξ̈ − 2 r0 Ω0 δΩ − ξ Ω0^2 ] = q B0 [ r0 δΩ + (1 + n) ξ Ω0 ].\n\n- Azimuthal equation:\n\nLeft-hand side:\nr φ̈ + 2 ṙ φ̇ ≈ r0 δΩ̇ + 2 Ω0 ξ̇.\n\nRight-hand side:\n− q B(r) ṙ ≈ − q B0 ξ̇  (drop O(ξ ξ̇)).\n\nThus:\nm ( r0 δΩ̇ + 2 Ω0 ξ̇ ) = − q B0 ξ̇.\n\nUsing Ω0 = − ωc0 and q B0 = m ωc0, this gives\nm r0 δΩ̇ − 2 m ωc0 ξ̇ = − m ωc0 ξ̇  ⇒  m r0 δΩ̇ = m ωc0 ξ̇\n⇒ δΩ̇ = (ωc0 / r0) ξ̇.\n\nIntegrating (choosing the integration constant so that δΩ = 0 when ξ = 0 for the perturbed oscillation):\nδΩ = (ωc0 / r0) ξ.\n\n4) Radial oscillation equation and frequency\n\nReturn to the linearized radial equation and divide by m:\nξ̈ − 2 r0 Ω0 δΩ − ξ Ω0^2 = (q B0 / m) [ r0 δΩ + (1 + n) ξ Ω0 ].\n\nSubstitute Ω0 = − ωc0 and q B0 / m = ωc0:\nξ̈ + 2 r0 ωc0 δΩ − ωc0^2 ξ = ωc0 r0 δΩ − (1 + n) ωc0^2 ξ.\n\nBring all terms to the left:\nξ̈ + (2 r0 ωc0 − r0 ωc0) δΩ + (−1 + 1 + n) ωc0^2 ξ = 0\n⇒ ξ̈ + r0 ωc0 δΩ + n ωc0^2 ξ = 0.\n\nNow use δΩ = (ωc0 / r0) ξ to eliminate δΩ:\nξ̈ + r0 ωc0 (ωc0 / r0) ξ + n ωc0^2 ξ = 0\n⇒ ξ̈ + (1 + n) ωc0^2 ξ = 0.\n\nHence the small radial oscillations are simple harmonic with angular frequency\nωr = sqrt(1 + n) ωc0 = sqrt(1 + n) q B0 / m.\n\nThis requires stability condition 1 + n > 0 (i.e., n > −1). For n = −1 the oscillation frequency vanishes (marginal), and for n < −1 the circular orbit is radially unstable.\n\nTherefore, the period of small radial oscillations about r0 is\nT = 2π / ωr = 2π m / ( q B0 sqrt(1 + n) ).\n\nHere B0 = B(r0).\n\nNotes:\n- For n = 0 (uniform magnetic field), T reduces to the usual cyclotron period 2π m / (q B0).\n- For n = −1 (B ∝ 1/r), T → ∞, indicating neutral stability of circular orbits with fixed speed.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ T \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_r} \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\pi m}{\\,q\\, B(r_0)\\, \\sqrt{\\,1+n\\,}} \\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\omega_r=\\sqrt{1+n}\\,\\frac{q B(r_0)}{m},\\ \\ (n>-1). } \\]"}

This allows us to reduce the computation to:\n- First, determine the effective resistance across an edge when all edges are equal (using symmetry and Foster’s theorem).\n- From that, deduce the equivalent resistance of the “rest of the network” between B and C when the edge BC is removed.\n- Then combine this “rest” in parallel with the modified edge BC of resistance 2r.\n\nStep 1: Effective resistance across an edge when all edges are equal\n- The dodecahedron graph has n = 20 vertices and m = 30 edges, and it is edge-transitive.\n- For a connected network of unit resistors, Foster’s First Theorem states:\n  ∑ over all edges e of R_eff(e) = n − 1.\n- Because all edges are equivalent in the regular dodecahedron with unit resistors, each edge has the same effective resistance, say R_edge(unit). Therefore:\n  30 × R_edge(unit) = 20 − 1 = 19,\n  which gives R_edge(unit) = 19/30.\n- If each edge has resistance r (instead of 1), all effective resistances scale linearly by r. Hence the effective resistance between adjacent vertices (with all edges equal to r) is:\n  R_all = (19/30) r.\n\nStep 2: Separate the edge BC and the “rest” of the network\nLet R_rest denote the effective resistance between B and C through all other paths when the edge BC is removed. Then, when the edge BC has resistance R_edge, the total effective resistance between B and C is the parallel combination:\n  R_total(R_edge) = (R_edge × R_rest) / (R_edge + R_rest).\n\nIn the all-equal case, R_edge = r and R_total = R_all = (19/30) r. Therefore:\n  (19/30) r = (r × R_rest) / (r + R_rest).\n\nSolve for R_rest:\n- Divide both sides by r:\n  19/30 = R_rest / (r + R_rest).\n- Multiply through:\n  (19/30)(r + R_rest) = R_rest\n  ⇒ (19/30) r = R_rest − (19/30) R_rest = (1 − 19/30) R_rest = (11/30) R_rest.\n- Thus:\n  R_rest = [(19/30) / (11/30)] r = (19/11) r.\n\nStep 3: Replace BC by 2r and recombine in parallel\nNow set R_edge = 2r. The equivalent resistance between B and C is:\n  R_BC = (2r × R_rest) / (2r + R_rest) = (2r × (19/11) r) / (2r + (19/11) r).\n\nIt is convenient to factor out r:\n  R_BC = r × [ (2 × (19/11)) / (2 + 19/11) ]\n       = r × [ (38/11) / (41/11) ]\n       = r × (38/41).\n\nAlternative compact derivation\nLet α := R_all / r be the dimensionless effective resistance between adjacent vertices when all edges are r. From Step 1, α = 19/30.\n\nAs derived above, R_rest = (α/(1−α)) r. If R_edge is changed to 2r, then:\n  R_BC = (2r × R_rest) / (2r + R_rest) = r × [ 2α / (2 − α) ].\n\nSubstitute α = 19/30:\n  R_BC = r × [ 2 × (19/30) / (2 − 19/30) ]\n       = r × [ (38/30) / (41/30) ]\n       = r × (38/41).\n\nHence the required equivalent resistance is (38/41) r.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{38}{41}\\,r} \\]"}

The cylinder is placed in a medium where a sound wave is propagating. The cylinder\\'s axis is aligned with the direction of wave propagation, which we define as the x-axis.\n\nThe given physical parameters are:\n-   $R$: The radius of the cylinder\\'s circular faces.\n-   $h$: The height of the cylinder.\n-   $\\psi(x,t) = A\\cos(kx)\\cos(2\\pi ft)$: The displacement of particles in the medium from their equilibrium position. This mathematical form describes a one-dimensional standing wave.\n-   $A$: The amplitude of the particle displacement.\n-   $k$: The wavenumber of the sound wave.\n-   $f$: The frequency of the sound wave.\n-   $P_0$: The ambient pressure of the medium in the absence of the wave.\n-   $\\gamma$: The adiabatic index of the medium (air).\n\nSince the sound wave is oscillatory, the first-order pressure force will also be oscillatory with a time average of zero. The net, steady force arises from second-order effects and is known as the acoustic radiation force. We will calculate this time-averaged force, denoted by $F$. We assume the cylinder is located at a position $x$.\n\nWe will define the following auxiliary variables for the derivation:\n-   $\\omega = 2\\pi f$: The angular frequency of the sound wave.\n-   $S = \\pi R^2$: The cross-sectional area of the cylinder.\n-   $V = Sh = \\pi R^2 h$: The volume of the cylinder.\n-   $\\rho_0$: The ambient density of the medium.\n-   $c$: The speed of sound in the medium.\n\nWe make the following assumptions:\n1.  The cylinder is 'small,' meaning its dimensions are much smaller than the sound wavelength $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$. This is expressed as $kh \\ll 1$ and $kR \\ll 1$. This allows us to treat the cylinder as a point-like object within the sound field.\n2.  The cylinder is rigid (incompressible) and much denser than the surrounding medium (air). Its position is considered fixed for the force calculation.\n3.  The presence of the cylinder does not significantly distort the incident sound field. This allows us to use the properties of the unperturbed wave to calculate the force.\n4.  The compressions and rarefactions in the sound wave are adiabatic processes.\n5.  The Gor\\'kov potential, originally derived for a spherical particle, is assumed to be applicable to our small cylinder. This is a valid approximation when the particle dimensions ($R, h$) are much smaller than the wavelength, as the force primarily depends on the particle\\'s volume and its bulk properties (compressibility and density) rather than its specific shape.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Pressure Perturbation to Particle Displacement\nTo find the force, we first need to determine the pressure variations in the sound wave. The pressure perturbation $P_1$ (the first-order deviation from ambient pressure $P_0$) can be related to the particle displacement $\\psi$ using the fundamental equations of fluid dynamics for an acoustic wave.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Linearized Equation of Continuity (1D): } \\frac{\\partial \\rho_1}{\\partial t} + \\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x} = 0}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Adiabatic Pressure-Density Relation (Linearized): } P_1 = c^2 \\rho_1}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Definition of Particle Velocity: } v_1 = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t}}\\]\nHere, $v_1$ is the particle velocity, $P_1$ is the pressure perturbation, and $\\rho_1$ is the density perturbation, all considered first-order quantities.\n\nWe derive the relationship between $P_1$ and $\\psi$ as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial P_1}{\\partial t} &= c^2 \\frac{\\partial \\rho_1}{\\partial t} &&\\text{(Time derivative of the adiabatic relation)} \\label{eq:1} \\\\\n&= c^2 \\left( -\\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x} \\right) &&\\text{(Substituting the continuity equation)} \\label{eq:2} \\\\\n&= -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( v_1 \\right) &&\\text{(Rearranging terms)} \\label{eq:3} \\\\\n&= -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} \\right) &&\\text{(Substituting the definition of velocity)} \\label{eq:4} \\\\\n&= -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\right) &&\\text{(Swapping partial derivatives)} \\label{eq:5}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIntegrating with respect to time, we get $P_1(x,t) = -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} + C(x)$. Since $P_1$ and $\\psi$ represent oscillating wave quantities, any time-independent term like $C(x)$ can be considered zero, as there should be no pressure perturbation in the absence of wave strain ($\\partial\\psi/\\partial x = 0$). Thus, we have our working relation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_1(x,t) = -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\label{eq:P1_psi_relation} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate First-Order Field Variables\nUsing the given displacement field $\\psi(x,t) = A\\cos(kx)\\cos(\\omega t)$ (where $\\omega=2\\pi f$), we can now find the explicit expressions for the first-order particle velocity $v_1$ and pressure perturbation $P_1$.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_1(x,t) &= \\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ A\\cos(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -A\\omega\\cos(kx)\\sin(\\omega t) \\label{eq:v1_calc} \\tag{7} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ A\\cos(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\right] = -Ak\\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\label{eq:dpsi_dx_calc} \\tag{8} \\\\\nP_1(x,t) &= -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = -\\rho_0 c^2 \\left[ -Ak\\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\rho_0 c^2 A k \\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t) \\label{eq:P1_calc} \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: The Acoustic Radiation Force and Gor\\'kov Potential\nThe time-averaged force on a small object in a sound field, the acoustic radiation force, is conservative and can be derived from an effective potential energy field, $U(x)$, known as the Gor\\'kov potential.\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Force from Potential: } F = -\\frac{dU}{dx}}\\]\nThe general form of the Gor\\'kov potential for a small particle of volume $V$ is given in terms of the time-averaged energy densities of the unperturbed sound field.\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Gor\\'kov Potential (General Form): } U = V \\left( f_1 \\langle E_p \\rangle - f_2 \\langle E_k \\rangle \\right)}\\]\nwhere $\\langle E_p \\rangle$ is the time-averaged potential energy density and $\\langle E_k \\rangle$ is the time-averaged kinetic energy density. The dimensionless factors $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the monopole and dipole scattering coefficients, which depend on the material properties of the particle (subscript $p$) and the fluid medium (subscript $f$).\n\\[\\boxed{f_1 = 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_p}{\\kappa_f} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_2 = \\frac{2(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)}{2\\rho_p + \\rho_f}}\\]\nHere, $\\kappa$ is the compressibility ($\\kappa = 1/K$, where $K$ is the bulk modulus) and $\\rho$ is the density. For the problem of a solid cylinder in air, we assume the cylinder is rigid and dense.\n1.  **Rigid particle**: The compressibility of the solid particle is negligible compared to that of air, $\\kappa_p \\ll \\kappa_f$, so $\\kappa_p/\\kappa_f \\approx 0$.\n2.  **Dense particle**: The density of the solid particle is much greater than that of air, $\\rho_p \\gg \\rho_f$, so $\\rho_f/\\rho_p \\approx 0$.\n\nApplying these assumptions to the factors $f_1$ and $f_2$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_1 &= 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_p}{\\kappa_f} \\approx 1 - 0 = 1 \\\\\nf_2 &= \\frac{2(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)}{2\\rho_p + \\rho_f} = \\frac{2\\rho_p(1 - \\rho_f/\\rho_p)}{2\\rho_p(1 + \\rho_f/(2\\rho_p))} \\approx \\frac{2(1 - 0)}{2(1 + 0)} = 1\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, for a small, rigid, dense object, the Gor\\'kov potential simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU = V \\left( \\langle E_p \\rangle - \\langle E_k \\rangle \\right) \\label{eq:U_correct} \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Time-Averaged Kinetic and Potential Energy Densities\nWe now calculate the time-averaged energy densities using the first-order quantities from Step 2.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Acoustic Kinetic Energy Density: } E_k = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 v_1^2}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Acoustic Potential Energy Density: } E_p = \\frac{P_1^2}{2 \\rho_0 c^2}}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Time Average Identity: } \\langle \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\rangle = \\langle \\cos^2(\\omega t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\sin^2(\\omega t) dt = \\frac{1}{2}}\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the time-averaged kinetic energy density $\\langle E_k \\rangle$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle E_k \\rangle &= \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 v_1^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 \\left\\langle (-A\\omega\\cos(kx)\\sin(\\omega t))^2 \\right\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 A^2 \\omega^2 \\cos^2(kx) \\langle \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 A^2 \\omega^2 \\cos^2(kx) \\label{eq:Ek_avg} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the time-averaged potential energy density $\\langle E_p \\rangle$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle E_p \\rangle &= \\left\\langle \\frac{P_1^2}{2 \\rho_0 c^2} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2 \\rho_0 c^2} \\left\\langle (\\rho_0 c^2 A k \\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t))^2 \\right\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{(\\rho_0 c^2 A k)^2}{2 \\rho_0 c^2} \\sin^2(kx) \\langle \\cos^2(\\omega t) \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\sin^2(kx) \\label{eq:Ep_avg} \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Derivation of the Radiation Potential\nNow we substitute the expressions for the averaged energy densities into the simplified formula for the radiation potential $U$ from Eq. \\eqref{eq:U_correct}.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Dispersion Relation for Sound: } \\omega = ck}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nU(x) &= V \\left( \\langle E_p \\rangle - \\langle E_k \\rangle \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= V \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\sin^2(kx) - \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 A^2 \\omega^2 \\cos^2(kx) \\right) &&\\text{(Substituting from eq. \\ref{eq:Ep_avg} and \\ref{eq:Ek_avg})} \\label{eq:U_intermediate} \\tag{13} \\\\\n&= V \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\sin^2(kx) - \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_0 A^2 (c k)^2 \\cos^2(kx) \\right) &&\\text{(Using the dispersion relation)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\left( \\sin^2(kx) - \\cos^2(kx) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\left( \\cos^2(kx) - \\sin^2(kx) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\cos(2kx) &&\\text{(Using } \\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta \\text{)} \\label{eq:U_simplified} \\tag{14}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculation of the Force\nFinally, we calculate the force $F$ by taking the negative spatial derivative of the potential $U(x)$ and expressing the result in terms of the given parameters.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Sound Speed in an Ideal Gas: } c^2 = \\frac{\\gamma P_0}{\\rho_0}}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF(x) &= -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\cos(2kx) \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\cos(2kx) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^2 \\left( -2k \\sin(2kx) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2} V \\rho_0 c^2 A^2 k^3 \\sin(2kx) \\label{eq:F_intermediate} \\tag{15}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting $V = \\pi R^2 h$ and $\\rho_0 c^2 = \\gamma P_0$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF &= -\\frac{1}{2} (\\pi R^2 h) (\\gamma P_0) A^2 k^3 \\sin(2kx) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2} \\pi R^2 h \\gamma P_0 A^2 k^3 \\sin(2kx) \\label{eq:F_final_calc} \\tag{16}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis result shows that the force on the rigid, dense cylinder depends on its position $x$ in the standing wave.

For ε < 1 this will be the infinite sum of small arc increments, converging as the normal component decays geometrically.\n\nStep 1: Kinematics of a single hop (small-angle, near-surface)\n- Decompose the launch speed u0 into local tangential and normal components:\n  v_t = u0 cos θ ≈ k v0,  v_n = u0 sin θ ≈ k v0 θ.\n- For a near-surface hop, we may treat gravity as uniform with magnitude g = v0^2/R, and the motion as a standard projectile on a locally flat surface.\n  - Time of flight for launch speed (v_t, v_n): T = 2 v_n/g.\n  - Horizontal (tangential) range along the surface: s = v_t T = 2 v_t v_n/g.\n  - Convert to a central angle (arc over radius R): Δφ = s/R = (2 v_t v_n)/(g R) = (2 v_t v_n)/v0^2.\n\nFor the first hop:\nΔφ_0 = 2 (k v0)(k v0 θ) / v0^2 = 2 k^2 θ.\n\nStep 2: Effect of the bounce (restitution and smoothness)\n- Because the surface is smooth (no tangential impulse), the tangential speed v_t is unchanged at impact.\n- The normal component just before impact has magnitude v_n (by time-reversal symmetry of projectile motion), and just after the bounce it becomes ε v_n (directed outward).\n- Therefore, on the ith hop, the normal component is v_n^(i) = ε^i v_n^(0), while v_t stays constant at ≈ k v0.\n\nThus each hop advances the landing point by\nΔφ_i = 2 v_t v_n^(i)/v0^2 = 2 v_t (ε^i v_n^(0))/v0^2.\n\nUsing v_t ≈ k v0 and v_n^(0) ≈ k v0 θ,\nΔφ_i ≈ 2 ε^i k^2 θ.\n\nStep 3: Total accumulated central angle\nAs ε < 1, the total angle before bouncing ceases (in the limiting sense as the normal component tends to zero) is the geometric series\nφ = Σ_{i=0}^{∞} Δφ_i ≈ 2 k^2 θ Σ_{i=0}^{∞} ε^i = 2 k^2 θ / (1 - ε).\n\nChecks and consistency:\n- If ε = 0 (perfectly inelastic in the normal direction), there is only the first hop and φ = 2 k^2 θ, matching Δφ_0.\n- As ε → 1 (perfectly elastic), φ diverges, consistent with perpetual bouncing of unchanged hop angle.\n- The approximation requires small angles and near-surface hops: the maximal height h_i ≈ v_n^(i)²/(2g) ~ (k^2 ε^{2i} θ^2 R)/2 must satisfy h_i ≪ R, and Δφ_i ≪ 1. These are ensured if k θ ≪ 1.\n\nTherefore, to leading order in the small parameters, the total rotation angle is independent of R and v0, depending only on k, θ, and ε through the simple expression below.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\varphi \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{2\\,k^{2}\\,\\theta}{\\,1-\\varepsilon\\,} } \\]"}

{"id": "69", "questions": "In 2023, the team of astronomers led by Jerome Oros at San Diego State University in the United States released their latest research findings, discovering a new binary star system called \"Kepler-49\". Meanwhile, astronomical observations indicate that nearby planets are influenced by this binary star system, resulting in orbital precession. This problem aims to explain this phenomenon concisely.\n\n\"Kepler-49\" is a binary star system mainly composed of two stars (Saka and Juipte) with masses $M_{S}$ and $M_{J}$ (both known). Under the mutual gravitational interaction, they perform stable circular motion around the center of mass. With an angular frequency $\\Omega$, the respective motion radii $R_{S}$, $R_{J}$ (unknown quantities) and the distance between them $R_{0}$ (unknown quantity) can be determined. The gravitational constant $G$ is known. \n\nThe rotation center of the two stars is set as the origin of coordinates, and a polar coordinate system is established with the closest point as the radial distance to describe the movement of the planet. Experimental observation shows that the scale of the Saka and Juipte system is much smaller than the distance to the planet (i.e., $R_{0} \\ll r$). Meanwhile, during one period of $\\Omega$, the planet can be approximately considered as not moving. The modified potential energy $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (unknown quantity) of the planet can be determined, retaining the lowest order correction term $\\delta V$.\n\nIt is known that the energy of the planet is $E < 0$, the orbital angular momentum is $\\bar{L}$, and the mass is $m$. Only considering the zeroth-order term $V_{0}$ of the gravitational potential energy, the motion equation of the planet $r(\\theta)$ (unknown quantity) can be determined.\n\nQuestion: Consider now the form of potential energy $V = V_{0} + \\delta V$ for the planet. In this case, $\\vec{B}$ is no longer conserved. Solve for the orbital precession angle $\\Delta{\\alpha}$ (express the answer in terms of $M_{J}, M_{S}, G, \\Omega, m, L$).\n\nHint 1: The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is introduced in the Kepler problem, and in this problem, it is defined as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{L} - G(M_{J} + M_{S})m\\hat{r}.\n$$\n\nConsider the planet moving only under the potential energy $V = V_{0}$, and in this case, let $\\vec{B}_{0} = \\vec{B}$.

Its magnitude is\n|B0| = G M m e,\nand equivalently, in terms of E and L,\n|B0|^2 = (G M m)^2 + (2 E L^2)/m, so e = |B0|/(G M m) = sqrt[1 + 2 (E/m) h^2 / μ_g^2].\n\n4) Apsidal precession from the 1/r^3 perturbation via LRL vector\n\nIt is convenient to use the LRL vector per unit mass, A = B/m = v × h - μ_g r̂, for which |A0| = μ_g e. Under a small central perturbation δΦ(r) = - c0 / r^3, the perturbing acceleration is\nδa = - ∇(δΦ) = - d(δΦ)/dr r̂ = - 3 c0 r^{-4} r̂.\n\nFor central perturbations (purely radial), the per-unit-mass LRL vector evolves as\ndA/dt = δa × h,\nbecause r × δa = 0. Therefore\ndA/dt = (-3 c0 r^{-4} r̂) × h = - 3 c0 h r^{-4} θ̂.\n\nUsing h = r^2 dθ/dt, so dt = r^2 dθ / h, we get\ndA = -3 c0 h r^{-4} θ̂ dt = -3 c0 r^{-2} θ̂ dθ.\n\nIntegrate over one full revolution (θ: 0 → 2π) of the unperturbed Kepler ellipse:\nr^{-2} = (1 + e cos θ)^2 / p^2,  p = h^2 / μ_g,\nθ̂ = (- sin θ, cos θ) in the orbital plane with x-axis along the pericenter (so A0 points along +x).\n\nThus\nΔA = ∫_0^{2π} dA = -3 c0 ∫_0^{2π} r^{-2} θ̂ dθ\n= -3 c0 (1/p^2) ∫_0^{2π} (1 + e cos θ)^2 θ̂ dθ.\n\nOnly the y-component survives:\n∫_0^{2π} (1 + e cos θ)^2 (- sin θ) dθ = 0,\n∫_0^{2π} (1 + e cos θ)^2 (cos θ) dθ = 2π e.\n\nHence\nΔA = (0, - 6 π c0 e / p^2),   so |ΔA| = 6 π c0 e / p^2.\n\nSince A0 points along +x with |A0| = μ_g e, the small rotation of the pericenter per orbit is (hint 2)\nΔα ≈ |A0 × ΔA| / |A0|^2 = |ΔA| / |A0| = [6 π c0 e / p^2] / (μ_g e) = 6 π c0 / (μ_g p^2).\n\nUsing p = h^2 / μ_g, we obtain\nΔα = 6 π c0 μ_g / h^4.\n\nRestoring c0, μ_g and h:\nΔα = 6 π (G μ_b R0^2 / 4) (G M) / h^4 = (3 π / 2) G^2 μ_b M R0^2 / h^4.\n\nIn terms of L and m (since h = L/m),\nΔα = (3 π / 2) G^2 μ_b M R0^2 (m^4 / L^4).\n\nNote that the dependence on the orbital eccentricity e cancels exactly: the precession per orbital period is independent of e to this order, as it must be for a central 1/r^3 perturbation.\n\n5) Express Δα in terms of M_S, M_J, G, Ω, m, L\n\nWe have μ_b = (M_S M_J) / (M_S + M_J) and M = M_S + M_J. Also\nR0^3 = G M / Ω^2 ⇒ R0^2 = (G M / Ω^2)^{2/3}.\n\nSubstitute:\nΔα = (3 π / 2) G^2 [ (M_S M_J) / (M_S + M_J) ] (M_S + M_J) (G M / Ω^2)^{2/3} (m^4 / L^4)\n= (3 π / 2) G^2 (M_S M_J) (G M / Ω^2)^{2/3} (m^4 / L^4),\n\nwith M = M_S + M_J. Tidying the powers of G and M:\nΔα = (3 π / 2) G^{8/3} (M_S M_J) M^{2/3} (m^4 / (L^4 Ω^{4/3})).\n\nEquivalently, and more transparently mass-independent if one uses the specific angular momentum h = L/m:\nΔα = (3 π / 2) G^2 μ_b M R0^2 / h^4 = (3 π / 2) G^{8/3} (M_S M_J) M^{2/3} / (h^4 Ω^{4/3}).\n\nSummary of intermediate key results used:\n- Effective potential (coplanar, time-averaged):\n  V_eff(r) = - G M m / r - G m μ_b R0^2 / (4 r^3) + O((R0/r)^4).\n- Unperturbed Kepler orbit:\n  r(θ) = p / (1 + e cos θ),  p = h^2 / (G M),  h = L/m.\n- LRL magnitude:\n  |B0| = G M m e,  or |B0|^2 = (G M m)^2 + (2 E L^2)/m.\n\nThe precession is prograde (Δα > 0) for the coplanar case, because the quadrupole correction increases the central pull more strongly at pericenter.\n\nValidity: R0 ≪ r along the orbit, and the binary period 2π/Ω is short compared to the planet’s orbital period so that time-averaging over the binary orbit is justified. Only leading order O((R0/r)^2) in the potential (i.e., O((R0/r)^3) in V) is retained.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\Delta \\alpha \\;=\\; \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\,\\frac{G^{8/3}\\,(M_S M_J)\\,(M_S+M_J)^{2/3}}{\\Omega^{4/3}}\\;\\frac{m^{4}}{L^{4}} \\;=\\; \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\,\\frac{G^{2}\\,\\mu_b\\,M\\,R_0^{2}}{h^{4}}\\,,\\;\\; \\big(h=L/m,\\;M=M_S+M_J,\\;\\mu_b=\\tfrac{M_S M_J}{M},\\;R_0^3=\\tfrac{GM}{\\Omega^2}\\big) } \\]"}

What is the subsequent change in velocity?", "solutions": "By noticing that the cutting of the magnetic field by the wire induces an electromotive force, which in turn generates Ampere force and torque, the motion state of the sphere changes. Now, due to the completeness of the circuit, the magnitude of the Ampere force is zero, and we only need to consider torque. Since the magnetic field here is uniform, the problem is to determine the magnetic moment $\\mu$.  \n\nWe use a fundamental yet concise method to solve this problem: we move to the rest frame of the sphere to analyze the problem, and establish the coordinate system as shown in the figure. In this frame, the magnetic field appears to rotate. It should be noted that the focus here is on solving the current distribution. This change of frame is purely mathematical and does not involve relativistic effects.  \n\nBelow, we only consider the variation of the magnetic field in the $\\pmb{x}$ direction, denoted as $\\dot{B_{x}}$, while the variations in the $y/z$ directions are analyzed analogously. Since the relationships between electromotive force, current, and magnetic moment are linear, superposition can be performed in the end! Here, due to the symmetry introduced by the circuit, the electromotive forces and resistances for the eight mesh loops in the front and back are exactly the same, meaning all the loop equations for each mesh are identical. This results in no current through the cross-shaped wires in the center.   \n\nOnly the circular arcs perpendicular to the ${\\pmb x}$ direction have current, with the electromotive force given by:\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-\\pi R^{2}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nThus, the current is:\n\n$$\nI={\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2\\pi R\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nThe $\\pmb{\\mathscr{x}}$ component of the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{x}=I S=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{B_{x}}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the total magnetic moment is:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=-\\frac{\\pi R^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\dot{\\vec{B}}\n$$  \n\nIn the rest frame, the magnetic field rotates at an angular velocity of $-\\alpha$ (referring to the angular velocity of the sphere's rotation). Hence, $\\dot{\\vec{B}}=-\\vec{\\omega}\\times\\vec{B}$. In the ground frame, we arrive at a remarkably elegant result:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}=\\frac{\\pi\\mathcal{R}^{3}}{2\\lambda}\\vec{\\omega}\\times\\vec{B}\n$$  \n\nThis result is remarkably coincidental and symmetric, allowing us to utilize a simple vector method for mechanical analysis.

Each wire has resistance per unit length λ, so each full ring has resistance\nR_ring = λ (2π R).\n\nDenote the angular velocity of the sphere by ω (vector). The center-of-mass velocity is v (vector). The ground is sufficiently rough that rolling without slipping is maintained at all times. Hence the rolling constraint on a horizontal plane gives\nv = R ω × ẑ, \nso ω is horizontal and ω = |v|/R.\n\n1) Motional EMF in each ring\n\nFor a rigid loop of vector area A (magnitude |A| = π R^2, directed along the loop’s normal), the motional EMF from uniform B and angular velocity ω is\nℰ = - dΦ/dt = - d/dt (B · A) = - B · (ω × A) = - (B × ω) · A.\n\nLet the three rings have area vectors A1, A2, A3 forming an orthonormal triad attached to the body with |Ai| = A0 = π R^2.

Because the three rings only meet at the two nodes and share no wire segments, one can consistently take the loop currents to flow independently in each ring.

In the inertial frame, the two traveling waves are\nu_+(φ,t) ∝ cos(m φ − ω0 t),  (prograde)\nu_−(φ,t) ∝ cos(−m φ − ω0 t) = cos(m φ + ω0 t),  (retrograde)\n\nwhere ω0 ≡ ω0(m) is the (Ω = 0) natural frequency of the mode. For a slender ring’s in-plane flexural (ovalization) modes one typically has ω0(m) ∼ √(E I/(ρ A R^4)) × f(m) with f(m) ∝ (m^2 − 1), but the exact form is not needed in what follows; only that Ω ≪ ω0.\n\n2) Express these waves in the rotating frame\nSet φ = θ + Ω t:\n- Prograde wave in rotating coordinates:\nu_+(θ,t) ∝ cos(m(θ + Ω t) − ω0 t) = cos(m θ − (ω0 − m Ω) t).\nThus in the rotating frame its frequency is\nω_pro^rot = ω0 − m Ω.\n\n- Retrograde wave in rotating coordinates:\nu_−(θ,t) ∝ cos(−m(θ + Ω t) − ω0 t) = cos(−m θ − (ω0 + m Ω) t)\n= cos(m θ + (ω0 + m Ω) t).\nThus in the rotating frame its frequency is\nω_ret^rot = ω0 + m Ω.\n\nHence the degeneracy is split by\nΔω ≡ ω_ret^rot − ω_pro^rot = 2 m Ω,\nto leading order in Ω.

For small departures from sphericity, the surface shape is well described by linear (degree-2) theory; the resulting figure is an oblate spheroid with semi-major axis a (equator) and semi-minor axis b (pole).\n\nWe will compute the degree-2 “forcing” potential at the surface due to rotation and the lunar ring, then use the static Love number response of a homogeneous incompressible fluid sphere (h2 = 5/2) to get the radial displacement, from which we obtain a − b and finally the eccentricity e = √(a^2 − b^2)/a. We will work to first order in the (small) flattening.\n\n1) Degree-2 forcing from rotation\n\n- The centrifugal potential (positive by convention) at radius R and colatitude θ is\n  W_rot(θ) = (1/2) ω^2 R^2 sin^2 θ.\n- Using the identity sin^2 θ = (2/3)[1 − P2(cos θ)], where P2(x) = (3x^2 − 1)/2, the l = 2 part of W_rot is\n  W_rot^(2)(θ) = − (1/3) ω^2 R^2 P2(cos θ).\n\n2) Degree-2 forcing from the lunar ring\n\nModel the Moon as a homogeneous circular ring of total mass m (or line density λ = m/(2πr)) in the equatorial plane (z = 0) of radius r ≫ R. Let position vectors be R′ on the ring and x inside (|x| ≪ r). The tidal tensor (Hessian) at the origin from a point mass at R′ is (3 n_i n_j − δ_ij)/|R′|^3 times G dm, where n = R′/|R′|. Averaging around the ring:\n\n- All ring elements have |R′| = r and n = (cos φ, sin φ, 0). Then\n  ⟨n_x^2⟩ = ⟨n_y^2⟩ = 1/2, ⟨n_z^2⟩ = 0, cross-terms average to zero.\n- Thus the tidal tensor components for the ring are\n  T_xx = T_yy = (1/2) (G m / r^3), and T_zz = − (G m / r^3),\n  and the trace is zero, as required by Laplace’s equation.\n\nTherefore, near the origin, the ring’s potential to quadratic order is\nU_ring(x) ≈ U0 + (1/2) ∑_{i,j} T_ij x_i x_j\n= U0 + (G m / (4 r^3)) (x^2 + y^2) − (G m / (2 r^3)) z^2\n= U0 − (G m / (2 r^3)) R^2 P2(cos θ),\n\nwhere we used x^2 + y^2 − 2z^2 = −2 R^2 P2(cos θ).

This current generates an axial magnetic field Bz(r), which stores magnetic energy U_B ∝ ω^2. The external torque must supply power to both mechanical kinetic energy and magnetic field energy. This produces an electromagnetic contribution to the rotational inertia.\n\nStep 1: Bound charges\n- Volume bound charge density:\n  ρ_b = -∇·P. In cylindrical coordinates for P = P_r(r) r̂,\n  ∇·P = (1/r) ∂(r P_r)/∂r.\n  Here P_r(r) = P0 e^{k r}.

The total bound charge is zero as expected.\n\nStep 2: Currents due to rotation\n- Volume current density (azimuthal) from moving bound charge:\n  J_φ(r) = ρ_b(r) v_φ(r) = ρ_b(r) ω r = -ω P0 e^{k r} (k r + 1).\n- Surface current density (azimuthal) on r = R:\n  K_φ = σ_b v_φ(R) = P0 e^{k R} (ω R).\n\nStep 3: Magnetic field Bz(r)\nTake the long-cylinder limit (L ≫ R), neglect end effects.

A standard integral yields\n∫ r^3 e^{a r} dr = e^{a r} (r^3/a − 3 r^2/a^2 + 6 r/a^3 − 6/a^4) + C.\nThus\nI(k,R) = [e^{a r} (r^3/a − 3 r^2/a^2 + 6 r/a^3 − 6/a^4)]_0^R + 6/a^4\n        = e^{2 k R} (R^3/(2k) − 3 R^2/(4 k^2) + 3 R/(4 k^3) − 3/(8 k^4)) + 3/(8 k^4).\n\nHence\nI_em = 2 π μ0 P0^2 L [ e^{2 k R} (R^3/(2k) − 3 R^2/(4 k^2) + 3 R/(4 k^3) − 3/(8 k^4)) + 3/(8 k^4) ].\n\nConsistency check (k → 0):\nAs k → 0, I(k,R) → ∫_0^R r^3 dr = R^4/4.

The dust is at rest in the lab frame (the frame in which the potential is stationary) with uniform density ρ. As the sphere moves, dust sticks (adiabatically), increasing the sphere’s rest mass m(t) without changing its size.\n\nKey physical ingredients:\n- Mass accretion rate: in the lab frame the sphere sweeps volume A v per unit time, so\n  dm/dt = ρ A v.\n- Relativistic momentum p = γ m v, with γ = 1/√(1 − v^2/c^2).\n- The dust that sticks is initially at rest, so to be carried along with the sphere it must be accelerated from 0 to v. The rate at which tangential momentum is imparted to the newly accreted dust is γ v dm/dt, hence the dust exerts on the sphere a tangential drag force\n  Fdrag = −γ v dm/dt t̂ = −γ ρ A v^2 t̂.\n\nEquations of motion (uniform circular motion at each instant)\n- Let R = |r| be the (instantaneous) orbital radius and v = |v| the (instantaneous) speed. For uniform circular motion at radius R with speed v, the central force provides the relativistic centripetal force:\n  k R = γ m v^2 / R.\n  Equivalently, with angular speed Ω = v/R,\n  γ m Ω^2 = k.\n- Tangential (along-the-velocity) momentum balance, using p = γ m v:\n  d/dt(γ m v) = −γ v dm/dt = −γ ρ A v^2.\n\nFrom the last equation we can extract the time evolution of v. Using p = γ m v one finds (compute dp/dt including both m and v dependence, with dγ/dt = γ^3 v a_t/c^2 for tangential acceleration a_t = dv/dt)\n- dp/dt = γ^3 m v̇ + γ v ṁ,\nand setting dp/dt (tangent) to −γ v ṁ gives\n-γ v ṁ = γ^3 m v̇ + γ v ṁ,\nwhich simplifies to\nv̇ = − 2 ṁ v^2 / (γ^2 m) = − 2 (ρ A v) v^2 / (γ^2 m).\n\nRadius evolution\nA convenient identity for uniform circular motion is p v = k R^2, which follows from equating the radial component of dp/dt to the spring force: |dp/dt|radial = p v/R = k R. Differentiating p v = k R^2 in time:\nd(p v)/dt = 2 k R Ṙ.\nBut d(p v)/dt = ṗ v + p v̇ with ṗ = −γ ρ A v^2 and p = γ m v. Using the v̇ expression above, one finds\nṗ v + p v̇ = −ρ A γ v^3 − 2 ρ A v^3 / γ,\nhence\n2 k R Ṙ = −ρ A v^3 (γ + 2/γ),\nor\nṘ = − [ρ A v^3 (γ + 2/γ)] / (2 k R).\n\nIt is very useful to eliminate v and γ in favor of R (and m). The circular-motion balance k R = γ m v^2 / R yields\nγ m v^2 = k R^2.\nIntroduce β ≡ v/c and α ≡ k R^2/(m c^2). Then the balance relation becomes\nγ β^2 = α,\nand solving for β^2 as a function of α gives a compact closed form\nβ^2(R) = α / [α + √(α^2 + 4)], with α = k R^2/(m c^2).\nWith β known, γ = 1/√(1 − β^2), Ω = v/R = c β/R.\n\nUsing v = c β and γ = 1/√(1 − β^2), the radial decay rate becomes a remarkably simple function of β:\nṘ = − (ρ A c β R / (2 m)) [3 − 2 β^2].\nThis is exact for instantaneous uniform circular motion and variable mass, provided the accretion is from dust at rest and the only other force is the central spring force.\n\nSmall accretion correction and constant m approximation\nThe problem states m0 ≫ ρ A R and R^2 ≫ A. Over the radius change from R0 to R the total accreted rest mass is small compared to m0, so to leading order we may set m(t) ≈ m0 in the kinematics (γ, β as functions of R). The mass only appears as a constant parameter in those expressions; the effect of its slow increase is already captured in the drag and Ṙ formula.\n\nTime to shrink from R0 to R: exact quadrature\nWith m ≈ m0 constant, β depends only on R through α = k R^2/(m0 c^2), and the time to go from R0 to R is\nt(R) = ∫_{R}^{R0} dR / (−Ṙ)\n= (2 m0)/(ρ A c) ∫_{R}^{R0} dR [ 1 / (R β(R) (3 − 2 β(R)^2)) ],\nwith\nβ^2(R) = α(R) / [α(R) + √(α(R)^2 + 4)], α(R) = k R^2/(m0 c^2).\nThis integral gives the exact relativistic time (to leading order in the small accreted-mass approximation).\n\nTwo important closed-form limits\n\n1) Nonrelativistic limit (β ≪ 1, i.e. k R^2 ≪ m0 c^2)\nIn this regime γ ≈ 1 and Ω ≈ √(k/m0) (the nonrelativistic oscillator frequency). Then β = v/c ≈ (Ω R)/c ≪ 1 and the bracket [3 − 2 β^2] ≈ 3. The decay equation reduces to\nṘ ≈ − (3 ρ A)/(2 m0) (v) (R)/(?) = − (3 ρ A)/(2 m0) √(k/m0) R^2,\nsince v = Ω R ≈ √(k/m0) R.\nThis ODE integrates directly:\ndR/dt = − C R^2, with C = (3 ρ A)/(2 m0) √(k/m0).\nTherefore\ntNR(R) = (1/C) (1/R − 1/R0)\n= (2 m0^{3/2})/(3 ρ A √k) (1/R − 1/R0).\n\n2) Ultra-relativistic orbit (α ≫ 1 ⇒ β^2 → 1/2, γ → √2)\nFor very large radii (with m0 fixed), the circular motion approaches β → 1/√2, γ → √2, and the bracket [3 − 2 β^2] → 2. Then\nṘ ≈ − (ρ A c β R)/(2 m0) · 2 ≈ − (ρ A c R)/(m0 √2).\nThis integrates to an exponential decay:\ntUR(R) ≈ (m0 √2)/(ρ A c) ln(R0/R).\n\nRemarks on accuracy\n- The expressions assume that the accreted rest mass over the interval of interest is small compared to m0 (m0 ≫ ρ A R), justifying m ≈ m0 in the functions β(R), γ(R). The dynamical effect of accretion is retained through Fdrag and the rate Ṙ.\n- The general integral is exact under these assumptions; the NR and UR limits give simple closed forms that match the integral’s asymptotic behavior.\n\nSummary of the result\n- Exact time as a quadrature:\nt(R) = (2 m0)/(ρ A c) ∫_{R}^{R0} dR [ 1 / (R β(R) (3 − 2 β(R)^2)) ],\nwith β^2(R) = α(R)/[α(R) + √(α(R)^2 + 4)], α(R) = k R^2/(m0 c^2).\n- Nonrelativistic limit (k R^2 ≪ m0 c^2):\ntNR(R) = (2 m0^{3/2})/(3 ρ A √k) (1/R − 1/R0).\n- Ultra-relativistic limit (k R^2 ≫ m0 c^2):\ntUR(R) ≈ (m0 √2)/(ρ A c) ln(R0/R).\n\nThese provide the time required for the uniform circular orbit radius to decrease from R0 to R in a harmonically bound relativistic oscillator accreting stationary dust.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{With }m(t)\\approx m_0\\text{ (since }m_0 \\gg \\rho A R\\text{), the instantaneous circular motion satisfies }\\\\\n&\\qquad k\\,R=\\frac{\\gamma m_0 v^2}{R},\\quad \\beta\\equiv \\frac{v}{c},\\quad \\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}},\\\\\n&\\text{and the accretion drag gives } \\dot R=-\\frac{\\rho A\\,c\\,\\beta\\,R}{2m_0}\\Bigl(3-2\\beta^2\\Bigr).\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{Eliminating }v,\\gamma\\text{ using the circular balance, one finds } \\beta^2(R)=\\frac{\\alpha(R)}{\\alpha(R)+\\sqrt{\\alpha(R)^2+4}},\\quad\n\\alpha(R)=\\frac{k R^2}{m_0 c^2}.\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{Hence the time to shrink from }R_0\\text{ to }R\\text{ is the quadrature}\\\\\n&\\qquad t(R)=\\frac{2m_0}{\\rho A c}\\int_{R}^{R_0}\\frac{dR}{R\\,\\beta(R)\\,\\bigl(3-2\\beta(R)^2\\bigr)}.\\\\[6pt]\n&\\text{Two useful closed-form limits:}\\\\[2pt]\n&\\text{(i) Nonrelativistic }(\\alpha\\ll 1):\\quad t_{\\rm NR}(R)=\\frac{2\\,m_0^{3/2}}{3\\,\\rho A\\,\\sqrt{k}}\\left(\\frac{1}{R}-\\frac{1}{R_0}\\right).\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{(ii) Ultra-relativistic }(\\alpha\\gg 1):\\quad t_{\\rm UR}(R)\\simeq \\frac{m_0\\sqrt{2}}{\\rho A c}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{R_0}{R}\\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}

{"id": "648", "questions": "In a vacuum, there are concentric spherical shells made of insulating material with radii $R$ and $2R$. The inner shell is uniformly charged with a total charge of $Q(Q>0)$, while the outer shell is uncharged. There is also a small insulating sphere with a charge of $+q(q>0)$ and a mass $m$, which can be launched from a point on the inner shell with a certain velocity. The direction can be adjusted, and its motion is confined between the inner and outer shells. Collisions with the inner and outer shells are perfectly elastic, and the charges do not change during collisions. It is known that the sphere can return to its starting point after making one full orbit around the center. If the sphere is launched from point $A$ on the inner shell and it collides with the inner shell a total of $n$ times (counting the final return to the starting point as one collision), determine the minimum launch speed $v$, ignoring gravity.\n", "solutions": "Let the distance from the center of the sphere to the position of the ball at the extreme point be $r_{1}$, and the speed be $ u_{\\mathrm{_I}}$.

Each time it collides with the inner sphere shell, it also collides with the outer sphere shell, and returns to point $A$. The angular displacement around the center during inner and outer sphere collisions is: $$ \\alpha = {\\frac{2\\pi}{2n}} = {\\frac{\\pi}{n}} $$ The curve $AB$ is its trajectory, with point $O$ as one focus of the hyperbola, and $C$ as the other focus. According to conic section knowledge, the trajectory of the hyperbola to focus $O$ is: $$ r = \\frac{p}{e\\cos\\theta^{\\prime}-1} $$ where $\\theta^{\\prime}$ is the angle between the trajectory of the ball and its polar axis.

To minimize the launch speed $ u_{0}$, and thus minimize energy $E$, $2a$ should be maximized, making $AC$ minimal, satisfying the condition when focus $C$ is at the extended line $OA$ and intersects the asymptote of the hyperbola at point $D$.

The region r>R has electric field E(r)=k_e Q/r^2 (radially outward), where k_e=1/(4πϵ0). The potential is V(r)=k_e Q/r, and the potential energy of the small charged sphere is U(r)=qV(r)=K/r with K≡k_e qQ>0.\n- Outer insulating spherical shell of radius 2R is uncharged; it exerts no electrostatic force, but it elastically reflects the sphere.\n- The small sphere (mass m, charge +q) moves only in the region R≤r≤2R. Collisions with both shells are perfectly elastic (specular): the normal (radial) component of velocity is reversed, the tangential component is unchanged.\n- Between collisions, motion is under a central inverse-square repulsive force F(r)=+K/r^2 r̂.\n\nKey conserved quantities between collisions:\n- Total mechanical energy E and angular momentum L are conserved in the field.\n- At a specular reflection on a spherical wall of fixed radius r0, the tangential speed v_t is unchanged and the radial speed v_r reverses sign. Hence the speed magnitude |v| is unchanged and, crucially, the angular momentum L=m r0 v_t is conserved at the impact as well. Therefore, E and L are constants throughout the whole motion, even across bounces.\n\nPlanarity and effective one-parameter family:\n- The motion is planar (central force). Take polar coordinates (r,φ) in that plane. The speed is v^2=ṙ^2+(rφ̇)^2 and L=m r^2 φ̇. Energy reads\n  E = (1/2) m(ṙ^2 + (L/(m r))^2) + K/r.\n\nGeometric structure of inter-collision arcs:\n- In a 1/r central potential, the orbit segments are conic sections with the center as focus. For repulsive Coulomb, the free-space orbit is a hyperbola with polar equation\n  r(φ) = p / (e cos(φ-ω) − 1),\n  where p = L^2/(mK) and e = sqrt(1 + 2 E L^2/(m K^2)) > 1 is the eccentricity, ω is an orientation constant.\n- The minimal radius (periapsis) of the hyperbola is r_min = p/(e−1).\n\nWhy the extremal (minimum) speed corresponds to a tangential launch at r=R:\n- For a fixed launch speed v at r=R, the total energy E = K/R + (1/2) m v^2 is fixed, while the angular momentum is L = m R v_t ≤ m R v, with equality if and only if the launch is purely tangential (v_r=0).\n- The angular advance per bounce cycle (from R→2R→R) increases with L at fixed E (intuitively: more tangential motion sweeps more angle before the next impact). Thus, for a given required angular advance per cycle, the minimal v is achieved by maximizing L, i.e., by a tangential launch at r=R.\n- For a tangential launch at r=R, the starting point is periapsis of the hyperbola: r_min = R. This implies a simple algebraic relation among parameters:\n  e − 1 = p/R, i.e., e = 1 + p/R = 1 + L^2/(m K R).\n\nAngle swept from R to 2R in the tangential (periapsis) case:\n- Put φ=ω at r=R (periapsis). Let Δ be the angular advance from r=R to r=2R:\n  2R = p / (e cosΔ − 1) ⇒ e cosΔ − 1 = p/(2R).\n- Using e = 1 + p/R, we obtain\n  cosΔ = (1 + p/(2R)) / (1 + p/R).\n- Introduce the dimensionless parameter\n  s ≡ p/R = L^2/(m K R) = (m^2 R^2 v^2)/(m K R) = (m R v^2)/K,\n  since for the tangential launch L = m R v. Then\n  cosΔ = (1 + s/2) / (1 + s).\n\nAngle per full inner-outer-inner cycle and the closure condition:\n- The return leg 2R→R contributes the same angular advance Δ (by time-reversal symmetry and conservation of E and L). Thus the angle per cycle (R→2R→R) is 2Δ.\n- The sphere collides with the inner shell once per full cycle. If it returns to its starting point A on the inner shell after a total of n inner-shell collisions (counting the final return), and if it makes exactly one full revolution around the center in doing so, we must have\n  n × (2Δ) = 2π ⇒ Δ = π/n.\n\nSolving for the minimum launch speed:\n- Set cosΔ = cos(π/n) equal to (1 + s/2)/(1 + s) and solve for s:\n  cos(π/n) = (1 + s/2)/(1 + s)\n  ⇒ 1 + s/2 = cos(π/n) (1 + s)\n  ⇒ (1/2 − cos(π/n)) s = cos(π/n) − 1\n  ⇒ s = 2[1 − cos(π/n)] / [2 cos(π/n) − 1].\n- Recalling s = (m R v^2)/K, we have\n  v_min^2 = (K/(m R)) × 2[1 − cos(π/n)]/[2 cos(π/n) − 1]\n  ⇒ v_min = sqrt{ (K/(m R)) × 2[1 − cos(π/n)]/[2 cos(π/n) − 1] }.\n- Using K = k_e qQ = (1/(4πϵ0)) qQ, this is\n  v_min(n) = sqrt{ [(k_e qQ)/(m R)] × [ 2(1 − cos(π/n)) / (2 cos(π/n) − 1) ] }.\n\nExistence and limiting cases:\n- The expression requires the denominator 2 cos(π/n) − 1 > 0 ⇒ cos(π/n) > 1/2 ⇒ π/n < π/3 ⇒ n > 3.\n- For n=3, the denominator vanishes and v_min → ∞. Indeed, as v→∞ (s→∞), cosΔ → 1/2 ⇒ Δ → π/3 is the maximal attainable single-leg angle; thus Δ=π/3 (n=3) is only achieved in the infinite-speed limit.\n- For n≤2, Δ=π/n ≥ π/2, which exceeds the maximal achievable Δ (π/3) and is impossible.\n- For n≫1, cos(π/n) ≈ 1 − (π^2/(2n^2)), yielding v_min ≈ (π/n) sqrt(K/(m R)), consistent with needing many small-angle cycles at low speed.\n\nAlternative trig form:\n- Using 1 − cosθ = 2 sin^2(θ/2), we can write\n  v_min^2 = (K/(m R)) × [4 sin^2(π/(2n))]/[1 − 4 sin^2(π/(2n))],\n  valid for n ≥ 4.\n\nSummary of physical reasoning:\n- Because elastic reflections on spherical walls preserve both energy and angular momentum (the walls only reverse the radial component), the entire motion is characterized by constant E and L.\n- For a given speed at r=R, the angular advance per cycle is maximized (hence the required speed minimized) by launching tangentially so that r=R is periapsis of the inter-collision hyperbola.\n- Imposing the geometric closure condition (n cycles produce exactly one full 2π rotation) fixes the required angle per leg, which then fixes the dimensionless s and hence the minimal speed.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nv_{\\min}(n)\n=\n\\sqrt{\\frac{k_e\\,qQ}{mR}\\;\\frac{2\\bigl(1-\\cos(\\pi/n)\\bigr)}{\\,2\\cos(\\pi/n)-1\\,}}\n\\quad\\text{for }n\\ge 4,\n}\n\\]\nwith the understanding that for n=3 one needs v_{\\min}\\to\\infty and for n\\le 2 the condition is impossible to satisfy.

The resulting Poisson–Boltzmann equation leads to an exponentially screened (Yukawa) potential, with screening length equal to the Debye radius λ_D.\n\n1) Boltzmann response and charge density\n- Let n0 be the unperturbed (equilibrium) number density of each species (electrons and protons), so overall neutrality holds at φ = 0: n_i0 = n_e0 = n0.\n- For species s with charge q_s and temperature T (assumed common T here for simplicity), the Boltzmann relation gives\n  n_s(φ) = n0 exp[ − q_s φ / (kT) ].\n  Thus, for singly charged ions (q_i = +e) and electrons (q_e = −e),\n  n_i(φ) = n0 exp( − e φ / kT ),   n_e(φ) = n0 exp( + e φ / kT ).\n- For e|φ| ≪ kT, expand to first order:\n  n_i(φ) ≈ n0 (1 − eφ/kT),   n_e(φ) ≈ n0 (1 + eφ/kT).\n- The plasma charge density (excluding the external point charge) is\n  ρ_plasma = e n_i − e n_e ≈ e n0(1 − eφ/kT) − e n0(1 + eφ/kT) = − 2 n0 e^2 φ / (kT).\n\nIncluding the external point charge q at the origin, the total charge density is\n  ρ(r) = q δ(r) + ρ_plasma(r) ≈ q δ(r) − (2 n0 e^2 / kT) φ(r).\n\n2) Linearized Poisson equation (screened Poisson/Yukawa equation)\nPoisson’s equation in spherical symmetry is\n  ∇^2 φ = (1/r^2) d/dr [ r^2 dφ/dr ] = − ρ(r) / ε0.\nSubstitute ρ(r) above:\n  ∇^2 φ = − q δ(r)/ε0 + (2 n0 e^2 / (ε0 kT)) φ.\n\nRearrange to the screened Poisson (Helmholtz) form:\n  ∇^2 φ − κ^2 φ = − q δ(r)/ε0,\nwith\n  κ^2 = 2 n0 e^2 / (ε0 kT).\n\n3) Solve the radial equation using the suggested substitution\nUse the hint φ(r) = u(r)/r. In spherical symmetry one has the identity\n  ∇^2 (u/r) = (1/r) d^2u/dr^2  (for r > 0).\nFor r > 0 (away from the delta source), the equation becomes\n  (1/r) u''(r) − κ^2 (u/r) = 0  ⇒  u''(r) − κ^2 u(r) = 0.\nThe general solution is\n  u(r) = A e^{κ r} + B e^{−κ r},\nso\n  φ(r) = u(r)/r = A e^{κ r}/r + B e^{−κ r}/r.\nTo have φ(r) vanish at infinity, set A = 0. Thus\n  φ(r) = B e^{−κ r} / r.\n\n4) Determine the amplitude B (matching the point charge)\nWe can fix B by integrating the screened Poisson equation over a small sphere of radius a around the origin:\n  ∫_V (∇^2 φ − κ^2 φ) dV = − q/ε0.\nBy the divergence theorem, ∮_S ∇φ · dS − κ^2 ∫_V φ dV = − q/ε0.\nAs a → 0, the volume term κ^2 ∫ φ dV → 0 (it scales like a^2). Thus\n  ∮_S ∇φ · dS = − q/ε0.\nUsing φ(r) = B e^{−κ r}/r, near r = a → 0 we have φ ≈ B/r and ∂φ/∂r ≈ −B/r^2. The flux is\n  ∮_S ∇φ · dS ≈ (∂φ/∂r)|_{r=a} (4π a^2) = (−B/a^2)(4π a^2) = −4π B.\nTherefore −4π B = − q/ε0 ⇒ B = q / (4π ε0).\n\nHence the potential is\n  φ(r) = (q / (4π ε0 r)) e^{−κ r}.\n\n5) Debye radius from the definition\nThe vacuum Coulomb potential is φ_vac(r) = q/(4π ε0 r). The ratio is\n  φ(r) / φ_vac(r) = e^{−κ r}.\nBy definition, the Debye radius λ_D is the distance where this ratio equals 1/e, i.e. e^{−κ λ_D} = 1/e ⇒ κ λ_D = 1. Thus\n  λ_D = 1/κ = sqrt( ε0 kT / (2 n0 e^2) ).\n\nRemarks and generalization:\n- The general multicomponent result is\n  1/λ_D^2 = Σ_s [ n_{s0} q_s^2 / (ε0 k T_s) ].\nFor a hydrogen plasma with n_e0 = n_i0 = n0 and T_e = T_i = T,\n  1/λ_D^2 = n0 e^2/(ε0 kT_e) + n0 e^2/(ε0 kT_i) = 2 n0 e^2/(ε0 kT),\nwhich reproduces the above. In many contexts where ions are much less responsive on the timescale of interest, one often quotes the electron Debye length λ_De = sqrt( ε0 k T_e / (n0 e^2) ), but with both species Boltzmann-responsive, the factor of 2 appears as derived.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\lambda_D \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0\\,kT}{2\\,n_0\\,e^2}}}\n\\]"}

The distance from a bottom center to the centroid is\n  r = (2R)/√3.\n\n- The line of action of the normal force between the top sphere and any bottom sphere is along the line joining their centers, of length 2R.

Therefore, the normal contact forces between pairs of bottom spheres vanish in equilibrium under this outward tendency:\n  S = 0.\n\n- Thus, the only horizontal inward force that balances F_out for each bottom sphere must come from the rope.

Each bottom sphere is adjacent to two such corners, so the total wrap on each sphere is 60° + 60° = 120°.\n\nFor a frictionless rope with uniform tension T that wraps around a cylinder over an angle α, the resultant force that the rope exerts on the cylinder is\n  R = 2 T sin(α/2),\ndirected along the inward bisector.\n\nHere α = 120°, hence\n  R = 2 T sin(60°) = 2 T · (√3/2) = √3 T.\n\n6) Solve for T\n\nFrom steps 4 and 5, we have\n  √3 T = R = P / (3√2)\n⇒ T = P / (3√2 · √3) = P / (3√6).\n\nTherefore, the tension in the rope is\n  T = P / (3√6).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{T = \\frac{P}{3\\sqrt{6}}} \\]"}

Considering that the problem only requires accuracy to the first-order term, the loss of ascent quotient can be divided into two parts for correction, with zero-order motion considered during the correction process.

The bottom is at θ = π, the two “rims” (ends) are at θ = 0 and θ = 2π (y = 0 at the rims, y = 2R at the bottom). We take y as the downward vertical.\n- A cube of edge r, mass M, is released from rest at θ = 0, sliding without rolling.\n- A thin layer of snow of surface mass density σ is stuck to the valley; it is at rest with the valley until touched, and then it adheres to the cube without changing the cube’s shape.\n- Small parameters: σ r R ≪ M and r ≪ R. Keep terms to first order in r (and hence in σ r).\n\nKey geometric relations of the cycloid\n\nLet φ(θ) be the tangent angle measured from the +x axis. For a cycloid,\n- dx/dθ = R(1 − cos θ), dy/dθ = R sin θ,\n- tan φ = (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ) = sin θ/(1 − cos θ) = cot(θ/2),\nso φ(θ) = π/2 − θ/2 and therefore\n- sin φ = cos(θ/2).\n\nThe arc length element is\nds = √[(dx/dθ)^2 + (dy/dθ)^2] dθ = 2R sin(θ/2) dθ,\nso the arc length from θ = 0 to θ is\ns(θ) = ∫_0^θ 2R sin(θ′/2) dθ′ = 4R[1 − cos(θ/2)].\n\nMass accretion (snow pickup)\n\nAs the cube slides, it sweeps fresh valley area at a rate equal (to first order in r/R) to width r times arc length increment ds. Hence the incremental mass picked up is\ndm = σ (fresh area) = σ r ds,\nso dm/ds = σ r.\n\nTherefore the mass of the cube-plus-snow after it has traveled arc length s is\nm(s) = M + σ r s,\nor, as a function of θ,\nm(θ) = M + σ r s(θ) = M + 4 σ r R [1 − cos(θ/2)].\n\nTangential dynamics with accretion\n\nLet v = ds/dt be the speed along the track. The tangential rocket-equation for a body accreting mass at speed v from material initially at rest (in the lab frame) is\nm dv/dt = F_t − v (dm/dt),\nwhere F_t is the tangential component of external forces. Here F_t = m g sin φ and dm/dt = (dm/ds)(ds/dt) = (σ r) v. Hence\nm dv/dt = m g sin φ − v (σ r v) = m g sin φ − σ r v^2.\n\nEquivalently, using a_t = v dv/ds,\nm v dv/ds = m g sin φ − σ r v^2.\n\nIntroduce w ≡ v^2, then dv/ds = (1/(2v)) dw/ds and the equation becomes\ndw/ds + 2 (σ r/m) w = 2 g sin φ.   (1)\n\nThis is a linear first-order ODE for w(s) with integrating factor μ(s) = exp[∫ 2(σ r/m) ds] = [m(s)]^2/(const), because m′(s) = dm/ds = σ r:\nd/ds [ m(s)^2 w(s) ] = 2 g m(s)^2 sin φ(s).   (2)\n\nTurning-point condition\n\nThe cube starts at rest at θ = 0 so w(0) = 0. At the highest point reached on the far side, θ = θ_f, the speed again vanishes: w(θ_f) = 0. Integrating (2) from s = 0 to s = s_f (equivalently θ = 0 to θ = θ_f),\nm(θ_f)^2 w(θ_f) − m(0)^2 w(0) = 2 g ∫_0^{s_f} m(s)^2 sin φ(s) ds\n⇒ 0 = 2 g ∫_0^{s_f} m(s)^2 sin φ(s) ds.\n\nTherefore the turning-point condition is\n∫_0^{s_f} m(s)^2 sin φ(s) ds = 0.   (3)\n\nChange variable to θ: ds = 2R sin(θ/2) dθ, sin φ = cos(θ/2). Then\nsin φ ds = cos(θ/2) · 2R sin(θ/2) dθ = R sin θ dθ,\nso (3) becomes\n∫_0^{θ_f} m(θ)^2 R sin θ dθ = 0\n⇒ ∫_0^{θ_f} m(θ)^2 sin θ dθ = 0.   (4)\n\nSmall-σrR/M expansion\n\nWrite m(θ) = M + δm(θ), where δm(θ) = 4 σ r R [1 − cos(θ/2)], with δm ≪ M. To first order,\nm(θ)^2 = M^2 + 2M δm(θ) + O(δm^2).\n\nSubstitute into (4) and retain terms through O(δm):\nM^2 ∫_0^{θ_f} sin θ dθ + 2M ∫_0^{θ_f} δm(θ) sin θ dθ ≈ 0.\n\nDefine\nI0(θ_f) = ∫_0^{θ_f} sin θ dθ = 1 − cos θ_f,\nI1(θ_f) = ∫_0^{θ_f} δm(θ) sin θ dθ.\n\nThen the condition is\nM I0(θ_f) + 2 I1(θ_f) ≈ 0.   (5)\n\nBecause the unperturbed (no accretion) turning point is θ_f = 2π, we expect θ_f = 2π − ε with ε ≪ 1. Then I0(θ_f) = 1 − cos θ_f = 1 − cos(2π − ε) = 1 − cos ε ≈ ε^2/2, which is second order in ε. Meanwhile I1 is already O(σ r R). Thus, to first order in σ r R/M, we can evaluate I1 by setting its upper limit to 2π (the O(ε) correction to I1 would be of higher order):\nI1(θ_f) ≈ I1(2π) = ∫_0^{2π} δm(θ) sin θ dθ\n= 4 σ r R ∫_0^{2π} [1 − cos(θ/2)] sin θ dθ\n= −4 σ r R ∫_0^{2π} cos(θ/2) sin θ dθ.\n\nCompute the remaining integral:\n∫_0^{2π} cos(θ/2) sin θ dθ = ∫_0^{2π} 2 sin(θ/2) cos^2(θ/2) dθ\n= 4 ∫_0^{π} sin u cos^2 u du  (with u = θ/2, dθ = 2 du)\n= 4 [2/3] = 8/3.\n\nTherefore\nI1(2π) = −4 σ r R · (8/3) = −32 σ r R / 3.\n\nPlug into (5):\nM I0(θ_f) + 2 I1(θ_f) ≈ M (1 − cos θ_f) − 64 σ r R / 3 = 0,\n\nso\n1 − cos θ_f ≈ (64/3) (σ r R / M).   (6)\n\nHighest position (vertical height shortfall at the far rim)\n\nAt the “rim” (θ = 2π), y = 0. The cube turns around at θ = θ_f < 2π with y(θ_f) = R[1 − cos θ_f] downwards from the rim. Using (6),\ny_max below the far rim: Δh ≡ y(θ_f) = R (1 − cos θ_f) ≈ (64/3) (σ r R^2 / M).\n\nEquivalently, the angular shortfall from the rim is small:\nLet θ_f = 2π − ε with ε ≪ 1; then 1 − cos θ_f = 1 − cos ε ≈ ε^2/2, giving\nε ≈ 8 √(2/3) √(σ r R / M),\nso the turning parameter is\nθ_f ≈ 2π − 8 √(2/3) √(σ r R / M).\n\nComments on approximations and geometry\n\n- The rate of snow pickup dm = σ r ds uses that the fresh area contacted per arc length ds is width r times ds. Curvature corrections are O(r^2/R) and are neglected (r ≪ R).\n- The tangential gravitational drive mg sin φ is unaffected (to this order) by the finite offset of the cube’s center of mass above the track surface; the face remains tangent, and sin φ is determined by the track’s geometry. The COM offset at the cusps (θ = 0, 2π) vanishes because cos φ = 0 there, so the quoted Δh is directly the shortfall below the rim.\n- The result is first order in r and σ and valid for σ r R ≪ M, r ≪ R.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\,\\Delta h \\;\\equiv\\; y_{\\text{max below far rim}} \\;=\\; R\\bigl(1-\\cos\\theta_f\\bigr)\\;\\approx\\;\\frac{64}{3}\\,\\frac{\\sigma\\,r\\,R^{2}}{M}\\,} \\]\n\n(Equivalently, θ_f ≈ 2π − 8√(2/3)√(σ r R/M).)"}

In that frame, the ship moves at speed v1 and the dust at speed v2 in the same direction (assume v1 > v2 so the dust actually strikes the windward face).\n- Define β1 = v1/c, β2 = v2/c, γ1 = 1/√(1 − β1^2), γ2 = 1/√(1 − β2^2).\n\nThe dust velocity in the spaceship frame (1D velocity addition) is\nu' = (v2 − v1)/(1 − v1 v2/c^2).\nIts magnitude (the speed of the dust in the ship frame) is\nw = |u'| = c |β1 − β2|/(1 − β1 β2).\n\nThe corresponding Lorentz factor for the dust as measured on the ship is the relative gamma\nΓ ≡ γ(u') = γ1 γ2 (1 − β1 β2) = 1/√(1 − w^2/c^2).\n\nThe number density of dust in the ship frame n' is found by Lorentz transforming the dust 4-current N^μ = (n c, n v2) from Earth’s frame to the ship’s frame (boost of speed v1 along x):\nN'^0 = γ1 (n c − β1 n v2) = n' c,\nso\nn' = γ1 n (1 − β1 β2).\n\nStep 2: Momentum transfer per collision (elastic reflection)\n\nIn the ship frame, an incident dust particle (mass m) has 3-momentum p_i' = Γ m u' (along x). A perfectly elastic bounce off a rigid wall reverses the normal component of momentum while keeping energy unchanged, so after reflection p_f' = −p_i'.

Under strong ionization conditions, it can be considered as consisting of neutral monoatomic gas (with mass $m_{tot}=m_{N}+m_{e}$) and free electrons (with mass $m_{e}$) released through ionization.

I finish with a succinct final formula.\n\n1) Space charge in a rigidly rotating, isothermal plasma column (H ≫ R)\n\n- The typhoon core is modeled as a cylinder of radius R and height H (H ≫ R), rotating rigidly with angular velocity ω ẑ, and at uniform temperature T0. For convenience define\n  k = ω^2/(2 kB T0).\n- Under “strong ionization” we have (singly) ionized positive ions and free electrons. Neglecting the feedback of internal electric fields on the density profiles (as stated), and ignoring interparticle interactions, both species follow Boltzmann-like profiles in the rotating frame due to the centrifugal potential:\n  n_i(r) = Ci exp(k mi r^2), n_e(r) = Ce exp(k me r^2),\n  where mi is the ion mass (approximately mN) and me ≪ mi. The constants Ci, Ce are fixed by the total numbers (or by global neutrality). If we assume overall neutrality of the column (no net charge per unit height), then the total ion and electron numbers (per unit height) must be equal:\n  ∫_0^R 2π r n_i(r) dr = ∫_0^R 2π r n_e(r) dr.\n  This gives a relation between Ce and Ci:\n  Ce/Ci = (ae/ai) [e^{ai R^2} - 1]/[e^{ae R^2} - 1], where as ≡ k ms.\n- The net charge density is\n  ρ(r) = e [n_i(r) - n_e(r)] = e Ci [e^{ai r^2} - β e^{ae r^2}], with β ≡ Ce/Ci as above.\n- For H ≫ R, end effects are negligible and Gauss’s law for cylindrical symmetry gives the radial field:\n  E_r(r) = [1/(ε0 r)] ∫_0^r ρ(r′) r′ dr′\n         = [e Ci/(ε0 r)] { [e^{ai r^2} - 1]/(2 ai) - β [e^{ae r^2} - 1]/(2 ae) }.\n- The radial derivative needed later can be cast in a compact, general identity that follows from Gauss’s law:\n  E′_r(r) = dE_r/dr = ρ(r)/ε0 − E_r(r)/r.\n\nThis identity is true for any axisymmetric ρ(r), not just the explicit exponential model. It will let us express the dynamics in compact form without having to carry the Boltzmann constants Ci, Ce, ai, ae explicitly.\n\nAs a useful alternative parametrization, introduce the charge per unit height enclosed within radius r:\n  q_encl(r) ≡ ∫_0^r 2π r′ ρ(r′) dr′.\nThen E_r(r) = q_encl(r)/(2π ε0 r), and\n  E′_r(r) = (1/(2π ε0)) [ q′_encl(r)/r − q_encl(r)/r^2 ].\n\n2) Dynamics of the UAV in the rotating frame\n\n- Let the UAV of mass m and (net) charge qU move in the horizontal plane at z = const. It is constrained to use only vertical thrust; hence, horizontally it is force-free except for the ambient electric field. In the rotating frame with angular velocity ω ẑ, the equations of motion are\n  m dv′/dt = qU E(r) + F_cf + F_cor,\n  where E(r) = E_r(r) r̂, F_cf = −∇(−½ m ω^2 r^2) = + m ω^2 r r̂ (centrifugal, outward), and F_cor = −2 m ω ẑ × v′ (Coriolis). There are no horizontal aerodynamic thrusts by assumption.\n- The UAV is in a steady circular state at radius r0 with no motion in the rotating frame (v′ = 0). Force balance at r0 (radial direction) requires\n  qU E_r(r0) + m ω^2 r0 = 0.\n  This states that the (inward) electric force balances the (outward) centrifugal force.\n- Now perturb the UAV radially by a small amount: r = r0 + ξ(t), with |ξ| ≪ r0 and initial small radial velocity u_r(t=0) = v0 ≪ ω r0. Let u_r, u_θ be the radial and azimuthal components of v′ (the velocity in the rotating frame). Linearizing about the equilibrium yields\n  • ξ̇ = u_r,\n  • m u̇_r − 2 m ω u_θ = [qU E′_r(r0) + m ω^2] ξ,\n  • m u̇_θ + 2 m ω u_r = 0.\n  The last two are the linearized radial and tangential equations including Coriolis; the bracket K ≡ qU E′_r(r0) + m ω^2 is the local curvature (stiffness) of the net (electric + centrifugal) radial force about r0.\n\nEliminating u_θ and ξ, one obtains a single harmonic-oscillator equation for u_r:\n  m ü_r + [3 m ω^2 − qU E′_r(r0)] u_r = 0.\n\nThus, the small-amplitude radial oscillations (the “epicycle” in the rotating frame) occur at angular frequency\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (qU/m) E′_r(r0).\n\n3) Expressing Ω at r = r0\n\n- Using the general identity E′_r = ρ/ε0 − E_r/r, one may rewrite\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (qU/m) [ρ(r0)/ε0 − E_r(r0)/r0]\n       = 3 ω^2 + (qU/m) [E_r(r0)/r0] − (qU/m) [ρ(r0)/ε0].\n- Using the equilibrium condition qU E_r(r0) = − m ω^2 r0, this becomes\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − ω^2 − (qU/m) [ρ(r0)/ε0]\n       = 2 ω^2 − (qU/m) [ρ(r0)/ε0].\n\nThis form is often convenient if ρ(r0) is known (e.g., from the Boltzmann profiles above). Alternatively, in terms of the enclosed space charge per unit height q_encl(r), one may write\n  E_r(r0) = q_encl(r0)/(2π ε0 r0),\n  E′_r(r0) = (1/(2π ε0)) [ q′_encl(r0)/r0 − q_encl(r0)/r0^2 ],\nso that the precession frequency can be expressed in terms of q_encl(r0) and its local radial derivative:\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (qU/(2π ε0 m)) [ q′_encl(r0)/r0 − q_encl(r0)/r0^2 ].\n\nRemark on the meaning of “precession”: The small radial epicycle in the rotating frame has angular frequency Ω given above. In the inertial frame, the particle also rotates azimuthally at nearly ω; the radial epicycle therefore “precesses” around the center. What is measured experimentally as a periodic modulation (precession) is the Ω above. In the special case where the electric field is locally linear E_r ≈ −α r (Hooke-like), one has E′_r = −α and the balance qU α r0 = m ω^2 r0 gives α = m ω^2/qU, hence Ω = 2 ω (the classic result for an isotropic 2D harmonic potential plus Coriolis).\n\nPutting it in terms of q0 and r0: a common and very useful choice of “q0” in cylindrical geometry is to denote q0 ≡ q_encl(r0), the net space charge per unit height enclosed inside r0. Then E_r(r0) = q0/(2π ε0 r0). Using the general result,\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (qU/m) E′_r(r0),\nwith E′_r(r0) written via q0 as\n  E′_r(r0) = (1/(2π ε0)) [ q′_encl(r0)/r0 − q0/r0^2 ].\nIf the local radial slope q′_encl(r0) is known (e.g., from the Boltzmann profiles), this gives Ω purely in terms of q0, r0, ω, and known constants.\n\nSummary of key, compact forms\n\n- Most compact and general:\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (qU/m) [dE_r/dr]_{r0}.\n- Using E′_r = ρ/ε0 − E_r/r and the circular balance:\n  Ω^2 = 2 ω^2 − (qU/m) [ρ(r0)/ε0].\n- In terms of enclosed space charge per unit height q_encl(r):\n  Ω^2 = 3 ω^2 − (qU/(2π ε0 m)) [ q′_encl(r0)/r0 − q_encl(r0)/r0^2 ],\nand with E_r(r0) = q_encl(r0)/(2π ε0 r0) and qU E_r(r0) = − m ω^2 r0.\n\nAny one of these forms correctly gives the precession (epicyclic) frequency once the local electric structure is known. The second form is often particularly transparent physically.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,\\Omega \\;=\\;\\Big[\\,3\\,\\omega^{2}\\;-\\;\\frac{q_{U}}{m}\\,\\Big(\\frac{dE_{r}}{dr}\\Big)_{r_{0}}\\,\\Big]^{1/2}\n\\;=\\;\\Big[\\,2\\,\\omega^{2}\\;-\\;\\frac{q_{U}}{m}\\,\\frac{\\rho(r_{0})}{\\varepsilon_{0}}\\,\\Big]^{1/2}\n\\;=\\;\\Big[\\,3\\,\\omega^{2}\\;-\\;\\frac{q_{U}}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}m}\\,\\Big(\\frac{q'_{\\mathrm{encl}}(r_{0})}{r_{0}}-\\frac{q_{\\mathrm{encl}}(r_{0})}{r_{0}^{2}}\\Big)\\,\\Big]^{1/2}\\,}\n\\]"}
