Set up coordinates so that $\\hat{z}$ points vertically upwards, the central axis of the tube is the z-axis, and set $\\mu = \\mu \\hat{z}$. The magnetic field produced by the dipole is strong and pointing away from the top and strong and pointing towards the bottom. Hence, as the dipole falls towards a given circular cross-section of the tube below the dipole, the magnetic flux upward through this disk is increasing. It follows that a current is induced in the tube below the dipole is clockwise as in the picture. Similarly, the current induced above the dipole is counterclockwise. Each can be treated like a dipole with moment equal to the area of the disk multiplied by the induced current. The bottom currents are anti-aligned and the top ones are aligned with $\\mu$. Thus, $\\mu$ is repelled by the induced dipoles below it and attracted to the induced dipoles above it. When this force balances gravity, $mg$, the dipole has reached terminal velocity.\n\n**Method 1:** Recall that the vector potential for a dipole is\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\times \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^{\\prime}}{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^{\\prime 2}} \\tag{8.3.1}\n$$\n\nwhere $ \\varepsilon=r^{\\prime}-r_0, \\mathbf{r'}$ is an arbitrary point and $ \\mathbf{r_0}$ is the position of the dipole.\n\nEvaluated on the tube itself,\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}_0}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{r}_0\\right|}=\\frac{R \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}+\\left(z^{\\prime}-z_0\\right) \\overline{\\mathbf{z}}}{\\sqrt{R^2+\\left(z^{\\prime}-z_0\\right)^2}} \\tag{8.3.2}\n$$\n\nThus, the vector potential on the tube is\n\n$$\nA(\\mathbf{r'}) = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu R}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\hat{\\phi}}{(R^2 + (z' - z_0)^2)^{3/2}}. \\tag{8.3.3}\n$$\n\nSince there are no electrostatic charges, we can set the scalar potential to zero.

You can't actually do the calculation that way since the strongest currents are induced near the dipole at which the current loops are sufficiently large as to invalidate the approximation.\n\n**Method 2:** The reason why I wanted to deal directly with the vector potential was so that I wouldn't have to actually compute any flux (area integral of the magnetic field of the falling dipole). It is quite a chore to do this directly. However, we can use a trick: think of the falling dipole as a magnetic monopole of charge $-q$ at $z_0$ and another one with $+q$ at $z_0 + \\delta$. The dipole moment is then, $\\mu = q \\delta$. The field of a monopole is the same as that of a point charge with the changes $\\epsilon_0 \\rightarrow 1/\\mu_0$ and $q \\rightarrow q \\rightarrow \\infty$. Now, it is straightforward to compute the flux due to each monopole. Add them up and you get\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\text{B}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu}{2} \\frac{R^2}{(R^2 + (z' - z_0)^2)^{3/2}}.\n$$\n\n(8.3.13)\n\nTaking the time derivative of this will give us the same emf (8.3.6), from which everything else\nfollows as in method 1.\n\n**Aside:** It's quite possible that I botched some minus signs here and there.

Use the fact that a nitrogen nucleus has spin $I = 1$ in order to derive the result that the ratio of intensities of adjacent rotational lines in the molecule's spectrum is 2:1. ", "solutions": "In the adiabatic approximation, the wave function of $N_2$ molecule whose center of mass is at rest can be expressed as the product of the electron wave function $\\psi_e$, the total nuclear spin wave function $\\psi_s$, the vibrational wave function $\\psi_0$, and the rotational wave function $\\psi_I$; that is, $\\psi = \\psi_e\\psi_s\\psi_0\\psi_I$. For the molecular rotational spectrum, the wave functions of the energy states involved in the transition have the same $\\psi_e,\\psi_0$, but different $\\psi_s,\\psi_I$. For interchange of the nitrogen nuclei, we have $\\psi_e\\psi_0 \\rightarrow \\psi_e\\psi_0$ or $-\\psi_e\\psi_0$.\n\nThe N nucleus is a boson as its spin is 1, so the total nuclear spin of the $N_2$ molecule can only be 0, 1 or 2, making it a boson also. For the exchange operator $\\hat{P}$ between the N nuclei, we have\n\n$$\n\\hat{P}\\psi_s = \n\\begin{cases} \n+\\psi_s & \\text{for } S = 0, 2, \\\\ \n-\\psi_s & \\text{for } S = 1, \n\\end{cases} \n\\quad \n\\hat{P}\\psi_I = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\psi_I & \\text{for } I = \\text{even integer}, \\\\ \n-\\psi_I & \\text{for } I = \\text{odd integer}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAs $N_2$ obeys the Bose-Einstein statistics, the total wave function does not change on interchange of the two nitrogen nuclei.

Since the energy difference between two adjacent rotational energy levels is very small compared with $kT$ at room temperature, we can neglect the effect of any heat distribution.

The derivation of the condition for \"sufficiently long\" T is mathematically sound based on a standard formula for the adiabatic theorem, but the resulting condition ($T \\gg \\frac{1}{2\\gamma_e} \\frac{H_x}{H_z^2}$) differs from the consensus reached by the other candidates.\n*   **Candidate Solution 2:** This solution uses time-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT) to find the final state. The derivation is mostly correct (despite a minor corrected sign error) and leads to the correct final state. The condition for adiabaticity is derived by comparing the adiabatic and non-adiabatic terms in the result, leading to the consensus answer $T \\gg 1/\\omega_z$.\n*   **Candidate Solution 3:** This is a very thorough solution that also uses TDPT. It correctly derives the full first-order expression for the state at time T and then shows how it simplifies to the expected eigenstate under the adiabatic condition. The derivation of the condition $T \\gg 1/\\omega_z$ is clear and consistent with the majority.\n*   **Candidate Solution 4:** This solution uses the adiabatic approximation, similar to Candidate 1. It correctly finds the final state. Interestingly, it derives the same condition as Candidate 1 but then argues for the consensus condition ($T \\gg 1/\\omega_z$) based on physical intuition, making its reasoning for the final condition less direct than the TDPT-based solutions.\n*   **Candidate Solution 5:** This solution is another solid approach using TDPT, very similar to Candidates 2 and 3. It correctly derives the state and the condition for adiabaticity. The final boxed answer, however, presents the full perturbative state rather than the simplified state for long T, which is less direct.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe primary criterion is the correctness of the final answer. All candidates agree on the final state of the electron at $t=T$ in the adiabatic limit: $|\\psi(T)\\rangle \\propto |\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{H_x}{2H_z}|\\downarrow\\rangle$.\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy in the condition for what \"sufficiently long\" means. Four out of the five candidates (Candidates 2, 3, 4, and 5) conclude that the condition is $T \\gg 1/\\omega_z$ (where $\\omega_z$ is the Larmor frequency in the $H_z$ field). According to the evaluation rule, when more than half of the candidates provide the same final answer, that answer must be selected. Therefore, the condition $T \\gg 1/\\omega_z$ is chosen as the correct one.\n\nAmong the candidates that provided the majority answer, Candidate 3 stands out for its completeness and rigor. It uses time-dependent perturbation theory to derive the state at time T, which naturally contains both the adiabatic term and the non-adiabatic correction. It then correctly identifies the condition under which the correction term is negligible, thus directly answering all parts of the problem in a cohesive manner.\n\n### Selected Final Answer\n\n**The state of the electron at time $t=T$ is an eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian provided that $T$ is sufficiently long. The state is given by:**\n\\[ |\\psi(T)\\rangle_{adiabatic} \\approx e^{-i\\omega_z T/2} \\left( |\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{H_x}{2H_z} |\\downarrow\\rangle \\right) \\]\n**\"Sufficiently long\" means that the time $T$ is much longer than the Larmor precession period associated with the strong longitudinal field $H_z$. This condition is expressed as:**\n\\[ T \\gg \\frac{1}{\\omega_z} = \\frac{\\hbar}{g_e \\mu_B \\mu_0 H_z} \\]"}

Solutions 2, 3, and 4 provide the exact same final formula. Since three out of the five candidates (more than half) agree on the final answer, this answer must be selected. These solutions correctly use standard quantum mechanics techniques (stationary phase approximation or the equivalent far-field approximation) to solve the problem in a general way, expressing the result in terms of the initial momentum-space wavefunction, $\\phi(p)$. This is the correct level of generality required by the problem statement. Solution 5, while mathematically correct for its assumed case, is not a general solution.\n\nThe selected answer is robust, physically intuitive, and derived correctly by multiple candidates using sound methods.\n\n### The Selected Final Answer\n\nThe probability per unit time that the particle arrives at time $t$ at an observer a distance $L$ away is given by the probability current density $J(L,t)$. This is given by the formula:\n\\[ J(L,t) = \\frac{mL}{t^2} \\left| \\phi\\left(\\frac{mL}{t}\\right) \\right|^2 \\]\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $\\phi(p)$ is the momentum-space wavefunction of the initial state, given by the Fourier transform of the initial position-space wavefunction $\\psi(x,0)$:\n\\[ \\phi(p) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\hbar}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ipx/\\hbar} \\psi(x, 0) \\, dx \\]"}
